## Customization Notes

### By Company Stage

- **Startup (< 50 people)**: Focus more on Module 2 (user research) and Module 4 (working with small teams). You'll likely need to be more hands-on and scrappy.
- **Growth (50-500)**: All modules apply. Pay extra attention to Module 3 (prioritization) as you'll face more stakeholder pressure.
- **Enterprise (500+)**: Module 4 (working with engineering) becomes critical as you navigate larger, more complex teams.

### By Background

- **From Engineering**: Module 2 (user research) may be the biggest growth area. Don't skip the JTBD exercises.
- **From Design**: Module 3 (prioritization/roadmapping) and Module 4 (engineering relationships) deserve extra attention.
- **From Marketing/Business**: Module 4 is crucial. Building credibility with engineers takes deliberate effort.
