- Build compelling product vision that aligns and inspires teams
- Create roadmaps that balance short-term wins with long-term bets
- Position your product to win in competitive markets
- Communicate strategy effectively to stakeholders at all levels

## Time Commitment

- **Total Estimated Time**: 18-22 hours
- **Recommended Pace**: 3-4 hours/week over 5-6 weeks
- **Can Be Compressed**: Yes, to 3 weeks for intensive study
