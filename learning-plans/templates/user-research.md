# Learning Path: User Research & Discovery

## Who This Is For

You're a PM who wants to get better at understanding customers, a UX researcher looking to deepen your practice, or a founder who needs to validate product ideas. This path covers Jobs to Be Done methodology, interview techniques, continuous discovery, and building a research practice.

- Conduct interviews that reveal real insights, not just what users say they want
- Build a continuous discovery habit that informs every product decision
- Turn research insights into actionable product opportunities
- Create a sustainable research practice that scales

## Time Commitment

- **Total Estimated Time**: 14-18 hours
- **Recommended Pace**: 3-4 hours/week over 5 weeks
- **Can Be Compressed**: Yes, to 2-3 weeks for intensive study

## Module 1: Jobs to Be Done Foundations

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

### Learning Objectives
- Understand why customers "hire" products to make progress
- Learn the four forces that drive and block behavior change
- Identify the three sources of energy behind customer decisions

### Core Episodes

| Guest | Episode Focus | Key Insight |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Bob Moesta | Jobs to Be Done | People hire products to make progress in their life |
| Teresa Torres | Continuous product discovery | Building discovery into your workflow |
| Kristen Berman | Behavioral science in product | Why users don't do what they say |
| Rahul Vohra | Superhuman's success | Finding and designing for the "job" |

### Key Frameworks

- [Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)](../../frameworks/discovery/jobs-to-be-done.md) - Understand context and outcome, not just pain and gain
- [Four Forces of Progress](../../frameworks/discovery/four-forces-of-progress.md) - Push + pull must outweigh anxiety + habit
- [Three Sources of Energy](../../frameworks/discovery/three-sources-of-energy.md) - Functional, emotional, and social drivers

### Exercises

1. **Your Own Switch**: Recall a product you recently switched to. Map the four forces: What pushed you away from the old solution? What pulled you toward the new one? What anxieties did you have? What habits were hard to break?

2. **Job Story Writing**: For your product, write 3 job stories in the format: "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]."

3. **Forces Mapping**: Interview someone who recently adopted your product. Map their four forces of progress.

### Reflection Questions

1. What's the difference between the "job" and the "feature"?
2. Why do customers often describe their job incorrectly?
3. How might your product's job be different for different segments?

## Module 2: Interview Techniques

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

### Learning Objectives
- Conduct interviews that reveal the real story, not rehearsed answers
- Navigate through layers of language to get to reality
- Know who to study (people who switched, not just complainers)

### Core Episodes

| Guest | Episode Focus | Key Insight |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Bob Moesta | Jobs to Be Done (interview technique) | The timeline interview method |
| Kristen Berman | Behavioral science in product | Understanding actual behavior |
| Teresa Torres | Continuous discovery (interviews) | Weekly customer conversations |
| Kevin Yien | Unorthodox PM tips | Creative research techniques |

### Key Frameworks

- [Layers of Language](../../frameworks/discovery/layers-of-language.md) - Get past pablum and fantasy to reality
- [Bitchin' Ain't Switchin'](../../frameworks/discovery/bitchin-aint-switchin.md) - Only study people who actually switched
- [Six Phases of Buying](../../frameworks/discovery/six-phases-of-buying.md) - Meet customers where they are

### Exercises

1. **Timeline Interview**: Conduct a JTBD-style interview focusing on a specific "switch" moment. Document the timeline from first thought to purchase.

2. **Layer Navigation**: In your next interview, practice pushing past vague language. When you hear generalities, ask: "Can you tell me about a specific time when that happened?"

3. **Behavioral Observation**: Watch someone use your product (or a competitor's) without saying anything. What do you observe that you wouldn't learn from asking?

### Reflection Questions

1. Why should you study recent switchers rather than loyal customers?
2. What's the difference between what people say, what people do, and what people want?
3. How do you know when you've gotten to "reality" in an interview?

### Reflection Questions

### Reflection Questions

1. How do you know when you have an "opportunity" vs. just an "observation"?
2. What's the relationship between the size of an opportunity and the risk involved?
3. How do you prioritize opportunities when you have many?

2. What's the line between "co-creation" and "building what customers ask for"?
3. How do you maintain research quality as you scale the practice?

## Customization Notes

### By Product Type

- **B2C**: Module 1 (JTBD) and Module 2 (interviews) are critical. Emotional and social forces often dominate.
- **B2B**: Module 4 (insights to opportunities) matters more. Multiple stakeholders complicate the "job."
- **Platform/Marketplace**: You have multiple customer types. Apply the frameworks to each side separately.

### By Research Experience

- **Beginner**: Focus heavily on Modules 1-2. The interview techniques are foundational.
- **Intermediate**: Modules 3-4 help you systematize and scale your practice.
- **Advanced**: Module 5 helps you build organizational capability, not just personal skill.

2. **Strategic Application**: Apply research to [Product Strategy](product-strategy.md)
3. **Interactive Learning**: Run `/learn jtbd` or `/learn user-interviews` for practice
4. **Test Knowledge**: Run `/quiz discovery` to validate understanding
5. **Explore Frameworks**: Run `/frameworks discovery` to browse all 15 discovery frameworks
