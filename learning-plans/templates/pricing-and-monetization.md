- Design packaging and tiers that align with customer value
- Monetize product-led growth without killing the flywheel
- Master subscription economics and retention metrics
- Run pricing experiments that generate real learning

## Time Commitment

- **Total Estimated Time**: 12-16 hours
- **Recommended Pace**: 3-4 hours/week over 4 weeks
- **Can Be Compressed**: Yes, to 2 weeks for intensive study

## Module 1: Pricing Fundamentals

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the relationship between price and value
- Choose the right pricing model for your product
- Know when to price based on outcomes vs. usage vs. seats

### Core Episodes

| Guest | Episode Focus | Key Insight |
|-------|--------------|-------------|

| Naomi Ionita | Product pricing | Pricing as strategic lever |
| Patrick Campbell | Bootstrapping lessons | Pricing lessons from ProfitWell |
| Julia Schottenstein | M&A, competition, and pricing | Pricing in competitive markets |

### Key Frameworks

- [Outcomes-Based Pricing](../../frameworks/execution/outcomes-based-pricing.md) - Price based on measurable outcomes, not usage
- [Go-to-Market Model Selection](../../frameworks/execution/go-to-market-model-selection.md) - Choose between PLG, sales-led, or hybrid
- [Product-Driven Revenue](../../frameworks/growth/product-driven-revenue.md) - Track revenue where product activity preceded sales

### Exercises

1. **Value Mapping**: List the top 5 outcomes your product delivers. For each, estimate the economic value to customers.

2. **Pricing Model Audit**: What pricing model do you use today? What models do competitors use? What would change if you switched?

3. **Willingness-to-Pay Research**: Interview 5 customers using the Van Westendorp method. What price ranges emerge?

### Reflection Questions

1. What's the difference between pricing based on cost, competition, and value?
2. How do you price when the value is hard to quantify?
3. When does "free" make sense as a pricing strategy?

### Reflection Questions

1. What's the trade-off between simple pricing and segment-optimized pricing?
2. How do you prevent customers from gaming your value metric?
3. When should you bundle vs. unbundle?

- [Modular PLG Approach](../../frameworks/growth/modular-plg-approach.md) - Apply PLG selectively based on conditions

### Exercises

1. **Paywall Audit**: Map every paywall in your product. Is each one at the right moment? Are any too early?

2. **Free-to-Paid Journey**: Map the ideal journey from free user to paid customer. Where are the friction points?

3. **Conversion Experiment Design**: Design an experiment to improve free-to-paid conversion without hurting the growth loop.

### Reflection Questions

1. How do you balance revenue extraction with growth loop velocity?
2. What features should always be free? Always paid?
3. How do you know if you're leaving money on the table vs. optimizing correctly?

## Customization Notes

### By Product Type

- **B2C SaaS**: Module 3 (PLG monetization) and Module 4 (subscription) are critical.
- **B2B SaaS**: Module 1 (fundamentals) and Module 2 (packaging) matter most. Sales involvement changes dynamics.
- **Marketplace**: Pricing is often about take rates and fee structures. Module 1 principles apply but implementation differs.

### By Stage

- **Early Stage**: Focus on Modules 1-2. Get the fundamentals right before optimizing.
- **Growth Stage**: Modules 3-4 help you scale monetization with growth.
- **Optimization Stage**: Module 5 enables data-driven pricing decisions.
