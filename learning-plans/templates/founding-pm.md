# Learning Path: Founding PM

## Who This Is For

You're the first PM hire at a startup, taking over product responsibilities from founders. Or you're a founder who needs to build PM capabilities. Or you're a PM joining an early-stage company where "scrappy" is the only option. This path covers finding product-market fit, building without resources, working with founders, and eventually scaling the PM function.

## What You'll Learn

- Understand the unique role of a founding PM and what success looks like
- Find and validate product-market fit through systematic discovery
- Build products with minimal resources by doing things that don't scale
- Work effectively with founders while maintaining your own judgment
- Know when and how to scale from 1 PM to a PM team

## Time Commitment

- **Total Estimated Time**: 15-18 hours
- **Recommended Pace**: 3-4 hours/week over 5 weeks
- **Can Be Compressed**: Yes, to 3 weeks for intensive study

### Key Frameworks

- [First PM from Within](../../frameworks/team-building/first-pm-from-within.md) - First PMs often come from within the team

### Exercises

1. **Role Definition**: Write a job description for your founding PM role. What will you own? What will you not own? Get founder alignment.

2. **Skills Inventory**: Map your skills against what the company needs. Where are you strong? Where will you need to grow or find help?

3. **Decision Rights**: Clarify with founders: What decisions can you make alone? What needs their input? What do they decide?

### Reflection Questions

1. What's the difference between being a founding PM and being a PM at a larger company?
2. How do you add value when founders already have strong product intuition?
3. What should you prioritize in your first 30 days?

## Module 2: Finding Product-Market Fit

- [PMF Survey](../../frameworks/discovery/pmf-survey.md) - "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?"

### Exercises

1. **PMF Survey**: Run a PMF survey with your users. What percentage say they'd be "very disappointed" without your product?

2. **Reference Customer Identification**: Identify 5 customers who might become reference customers. What would it take to get them there?

3. **Pivot Signals**: Define 3 signals that would tell you PMF isn't working and you need to change direction.

### Reflection Questions

### Reflection Questions

1. What's the minimum you could build to test your biggest assumption?
2. When does "scrappy" become "crappy"?
3. How do you balance learning speed with user experience?

## Customization Notes

### By Company Stage

- **Pre-PMF**: Focus on Modules 2-3. Finding PMF is your only job.
- **Post-PMF, Pre-Scale**: Modules 4-5 become important as you systematize and grow.
- **With Technical Founders**: Module 4 is critical—navigating the founder relationship is nuanced.

### By Your Background

- **From Big Company PM**: Module 3 (scrappy building) requires the biggest mindset shift.
- **From Engineering**: Module 4 (founder dynamics) may be new territory.
