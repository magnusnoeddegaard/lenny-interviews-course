# Learning Path: Growth Fundamentals

## Who This Is For

You're a PM taking on growth responsibilities for the first time, a founder trying to understand why your product isn't growing, or a marketer transitioning into a growth PM role. This path covers the foundational frameworks for acquisition, activation, retention, and experimentation.

## What You'll Learn

- Understand the "physics" of growth and why some companies grow faster than others
- Design acquisition strategies that match your product and market
- Build activation flows that get users to their "aha moment" faster
- Create retention loops that keep users engaged long-term
- Run experiments that generate real learning (not just vanity metrics)
- Build a growth model that predicts and guides your efforts

## Time Commitment

- **Total Estimated Time**: 18-25 hours
- **Recommended Pace**: 3-4 hours/week over 6 weeks
- **Can Be Compressed**: Yes, to 3-4 weeks for intensive study

## Module 1: The Physics of Growth

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

### Learning Objectives
- Understand why some products grow exponentially while others plateau
- Identify your product's natural growth constraints
- Map your existing growth loops (qualitative and quantitative)

### Core Episodes

| Guest | Episode Focus | Key Insight |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Brian Balfour | Growth frameworks | Growth loops compound; funnels don't |
| Andy Johns | Growth fundamentals | The foundational principles from FB, Twitter, Quora |
| Casey Winters | Growth strategy | How to think strategically about growth |
| Elena Verna | PLG and growth strategy | Growth is a system, not a tactic |

### Key Frameworks

- [Physics of Growth](../../frameworks/growth/physics-of-growth.md) - Understand market, product, model, and channel constraints
- [Growth Loop Model](../../frameworks/growth/growth-loop-model.md) - Map qualitative and quantitative growth loops
- [Three Engines of Growth](../../frameworks/growth/three-engines-of-growth.md) - Viral, sticky, or paid: each has its own feedback loop

### Exercises

1. **Growth Audit**: Map your product's current growth loops. Are they viral, content, paid, or sales-driven? Where do they break down?

2. **Constraint Analysis**: Identify the #1 constraint holding back your growth right now. Is it market size, product quality, business model, or channel efficiency?

3. **Benchmark Research**: Find 3-5 companies in your space. How did they grow? What can you learn from their trajectory?

### Reflection Questions

1. What type of growth engine is your product naturally suited for? Why?
2. If you could only focus on one growth loop, which would have the highest leverage?
3. What's the difference between growth tactics and a growth strategy?

## Module 2: Acquisition Strategies

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

### Learning Objectives
- Choose between PLG, sales-led, and hybrid go-to-market motions
- Build acquisition channels that compound over time
- Distinguish between "rented" and "owned" distribution

- [Earned vs Owned Channels](../../frameworks/growth/earned-vs-owned-channels.md) - Prioritize channels you own over rented ones

### Exercises

1. **Channel Assessment**: List all your current acquisition channels. For each, note: cost per acquisition, channel ownership (owned/rented), scalability potential.

2. **PLG Audit**: Does your product have a natural PLG motion? If yes, map the user journey from first touch to conversion. If no, why not?

3. **Viral Coefficient Calculation**: Calculate your product's current viral coefficient (invites sent × conversion rate). What would it take to get above 1.0?

### Reflection Questions

1. Is your acquisition strategy building an asset or renting someone else's audience?
2. What would break if your top acquisition channel suddenly disappeared?
3. How does your acquisition strategy align with your product's natural strengths?

- [Early User Experience Focus](../../frameworks/growth/early-user-experience-focus.md) - Fix the first experience, not re-engagement

### Exercises

1. **Activation Metric Definition**: Define (or refine) your product's activation metric. It should predict long-term retention.

2. **Time-to-Value Analysis**: Measure how long it takes new users to reach activation. What are the top 3 friction points?

3. **Onboarding Teardown**: Sign up for 3 competitor products. Document their onboarding flows. What do they do better than you?

### Reflection Questions

1. What's the difference between "aha moment" and "activation"? Why does the distinction matter?
2. Are you optimizing for activation or just feature adoption?
3. How much of your onboarding is education vs. motivation vs. friction removal?

### Reflection Questions

1. Is your retention curve flattening or continuing to decline? What does that tell you?
2. What would happen to your growth if you improved 30-day retention by 10%?
3. Are you investing more in acquisition or retention? Is that the right balance?

2. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Identify the top 3 levers in your model. What happens if each improves by 10%? 50%?

3. **Forecast**: Use your model to forecast 12 months out. What assumptions drive the biggest uncertainty?

### Reflection Questions

2. How often should you update your model? What triggers a refresh?
3. What's the most counterintuitive insight from your model?

## Customization Notes

### By Product Type

- **Consumer/B2C**: Focus heavily on Modules 3 (activation) and 4 (retention). Viral and content loops often matter more.
- **B2B SaaS**: Module 2 (acquisition) and Module 6 (modeling) are critical. Don't skip team-based activation.
- **Marketplace**: Retention is about both sides. You may need to model supply and demand separately.

### By Stage

- **Pre-PMF**: Focus on retention first (Module 4). If users don't stick, acquisition won't matter.
- **Post-PMF, Pre-Scale**: Modules 2 and 3 become critical. Find your repeatable acquisition motion.
- **Scale**: Module 5 (experimentation) and 6 (modeling) enable optimization at scale.
