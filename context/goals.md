# Learning Goals

<!-- Claude uses this to personalize your learning experience. Understanding your goals,
available time, and preferred learning style helps Claude recommend the right depth of content,
appropriate exercises, and realistic learning paths. -->

## Questions to answer:
- Why are you learning? What prompted this?
- What specific skills or knowledge do you want to gain?
- How will you know when you've succeeded?
- How much time can you dedicate per week?
- How do you prefer to learn?
- What topics excite you most?
- What topics should we skip or deprioritize?

## Example:

```
Why I'm learning:
Just got promoted to PM from engineering. Strong on technical skills but weak on
product strategy, user research, and stakeholder management.

Learning goals:
1. Get better at writing product specs that engineers actually want to read
2. Learn how to run effective user research (currently just guessing what users want)
3. Understand growth/metrics better — I don't know what "good" looks like
4. Build confidence presenting to executives

Success looks like:
- Shipping my first feature end-to-end without major scope creep
- Running 5 user interviews and synthesizing insights
- Setting up a metrics dashboard my team actually uses

Time available: 3-4 hours per week
- 1 hour on Monday mornings (podcast during commute)
- 2-3 hours on weekends for deeper learning

Learning style:
- Prefer concrete examples over theory
- Like frameworks I can immediately apply
- Learn best by doing, so exercises and templates are helpful
- Enjoy hearing stories from practitioners

Topics I'm excited about:
- User research and discovery
- Product metrics and analytics
- Writing better specs and PRDs

Topics to skip:
- Growth hacking tactics (not relevant to my current role)
- Consumer product stuff (I'm in B2B)
```

## How Claude uses this:

| Your Context | How Claude Adapts |
|--------------|-------------------|
| New to PM | Focus on fundamentals, more explanation, starter frameworks |
| Experienced PM | Focus on advanced tactics, edge cases, nuance |
| Limited time (<2 hrs/week) | Shorter modules, curated "best of" content |
| More time (5+ hrs/week) | Deeper dives, more exercises, broader coverage |
| Prefers theory | More "why" and conceptual frameworks |
| Prefers practical | More "how" with templates and examples |
| Specific skill gaps | Targeted learning paths for those areas |
