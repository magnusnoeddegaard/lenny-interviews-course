## Example:

```
Product: CodeFlow — a collaborative code review platform
Description: Helps engineering teams review code faster with AI-assisted
suggestions, inline discussions, and automated style checking.

Target users:
- Primary: Software engineers at mid-size companies (50-500 employees)
- Secondary: Engineering managers who want visibility into review bottlenecks

Problems solved:
- Code reviews take too long (avg 2 days → goal of 4 hours)
- Context switching between review tool and IDE
- Inconsistent code style across teams

Pricing: Freemium
- Free: Up to 5 users, basic features
- Pro ($15/user/mo): Unlimited users, AI suggestions, analytics
- Enterprise ($45/user/mo): SSO, audit logs, dedicated support

Key metrics:
- Weekly active reviewers
- Time to first review
- Reviews completed per user
- Free-to-paid conversion

Current focus: Building integrations with VS Code and JetBrains IDEs

Product challenges:
- Users love the product but don't invite teammates (viral loop broken)
- Enterprise prospects want features we haven't built yet (SOC2, SSO)
- Power users asking for features that add complexity for new users
