# Company Context

<!-- Claude uses this to tailor examples, case studies, and advice to your company's situation.
When you describe a Series A startup, Claude will focus on scaling challenges. When you describe
an enterprise company, Claude will emphasize organizational dynamics and stakeholder management. -->

## Questions to answer:
- What industry are you in?
- What stage is the company? (pre-seed, seed, Series A, growth, public)
- How many employees?
- What's the business model?
- What are the biggest challenges right now?
- Who are your main competitors?
- What metrics matter most to your business?

## Example:

```
Industry: B2B SaaS — productivity tools for engineering teams
Stage: Series A ($8M raised)
Size: 25 employees, 4 on product team
Business model: Freemium with per-seat pricing ($0/free, $15/pro, $45/enterprise per seat/month)
Main competitors: Linear, Jira, Asana
Key metrics: MRR, free-to-paid conversion rate, logo churn, NPS
Challenges:
- Converting free users to paid (currently at 3%, want to hit 5%)
- Competing with larger incumbents who have more features
- Deciding which enterprise features to prioritize
```
