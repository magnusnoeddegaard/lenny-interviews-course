Initial prompt:

Lenny Rachitsky just released all his podcast episodes in a github repo with the transcripts.
  It's located here: https://github.com/ChatPRD/lennys-podcast-transcripts

  I want to turn it into an interactive learning course where the user can simply ask about a topic and get Claude
  Code to help them learn about that topic, by giving them curated content from lenny, ask them questions, etc.



  I would like if users could have a couple of easy commands, where they can simply write something like /learn, and
  then the interactive mode starts where claude code starts asking them what topic they want to learn about, get
  Lenny's content, present the knowledge, ask the users questions to help them understand, and try to apply it to
  their context, etc.



  And /learning-plan could be that it would create a learning plan for the user based on how much time the user has,
  what their current knowledge of the topic is, etc. It would have to ask them questions about these things to be able
  to make a great output. The output would be a folder with the learning plan overview in a markdown file with as
  much context about the user as possible, and markdown files for each module.



  Maybe you can help me think of some more things that would be nice to have as /commands.



  Users should be able to either download a github repo or install a package to be able to interact with it.

  Users should also be able to upload a couple of files about their context (company, team and product info) so that
  Claude Code can provide more detailed responses.



  Can you please help me build out the above? Some of the things are probably a bit vague right now, so feel free to
  ask me questions, but let's start with creating a plan for how we can do this. I want to keep it fairly simple for
  now, and focus on how we can create that interactive experience with claude code (most likely using skills for the
  /commands?).
