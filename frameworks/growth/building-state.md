# Building State

> "The more state you build, the more you're compelled to stick around, because you don't want to lose everything you've worked so hard for. The more state you have, the more you can exploit that state to get more. The rich keep getting richer." - Julian Shapiro

## What It Is

Building State is a retention framework borrowed from video games, where the more you play, the more you accrue (armor, weapons, skins, levels). This accumulated state makes players unwilling to abandon the game because they'd lose everything they've built.

The same principle applies to software products. When users invest time and effort into building something within your product that they can't take elsewhere, they become deeply entrenched. This is why "mediocre companies like eBay or Craigslist remain completely unbeatable for decades" despite poor UX and lack of innovation.

Building state is often mistakenly called a "moat," but Julian argues true moats are rare (government protection, scientific breakthroughs + patents). What most companies have is simply a mechanism for retaining users better than average through state-building mechanics.

## How It Works

State building subdivides into several categories:

### 1. Non-Transferable Reputation
Users build reputation on your platform that cannot be moved to competitors.
- **eBay**: 10,000+ feedback ratings as a seller = locked in
- **Yelp**: Restaurant review history and reputation
- **Airbnb**: Host ratings and Superhost status
- **Etsy**: Seller reviews and shop reputation
- **Alibaba**: Supplier trust ratings

This is why these platforms constantly pester you to leave reviews - they're strengthening the state-building loop.

### 2. Non-Transferable Audience
Users build a follower base that only exists on your platform.
- **YouTube**: Million subscribers can't be moved to another platform
- **Twitter/X**: Follower graph stays on platform
- **Twitch**: Subscriber and viewer community
- **Instagram**: Follower relationships

The rich get richer - more followers make it easier to go viral and gain more followers. Creators may dabble with other networks but rarely leave entirely.

### 3. Curated Social Graph
Users invest time building and maintaining connections.
- **Facebook**: Years of finding and adding friends from various life stages
- **LinkedIn**: Decades of professional connections
- **Contacts apps**: Accumulated relationship history

If the platform doesn't allow graph export, users can't recreate these connections elsewhere.

### 4. Embedded Infrastructure
The product is so integrated that switching costs are prohibitive.
- **Stripe/Twilio/AWS**: Code is built around their APIs
- **Segment**: Data pipelines depend on their infrastructure
- **Salesforce**: Business processes built around the platform

Changing would require rewriting code and risking production stability.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify what users could accumulate**
   - Reputation/reviews
   - Followers/audience
   - Connections/relationships
   - Content/data
   - Customization/configurations
   - Integrations

2. **Design features that reward accumulated state**
   - Higher visibility in search for users with more reviews
   - Better algorithm treatment for accounts with history
   - Exclusive features unlocked through usage
   - Network effects that compound with connections

3. **Make state visible and valuable**
   - Show users their accumulated value
   - Highlight what they'd lose by leaving
   - Create milestones and achievements

4. **Consider lock-in vs. user benefit trade-offs**
   - Substack allows email export (user-friendly, less sticky)
   - Facebook doesn't allow graph export (sticky, less user-friendly)
   - Choose based on your values and competitive dynamics

## When to Use It

- **Product design**: Build state-building mechanics into core features from the start
- **Retention strategy**: Focus on features that help users accumulate value over time
- **Investment analysis**: Companies with strong state-building are more defensible
- **Competitive positioning**: Against well-entrenched competitors, you may need to offer state portability or bypass state entirely
