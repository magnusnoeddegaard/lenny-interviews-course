# Founder-Led Growth

> "I really believe that the founder-led growth is not being popularized enough. That you do not need growth teams until you actually can start running experiments on your user base, which means that you have volume of users that you can learn from and optimize and innovate on, and that first wave of growth has to be founder-led." - Elena Verna

## What It Is

Founder-Led Growth is the principle that early-stage companies should not hire dedicated growth teams until they've achieved product-market fit and accumulated enough user data to run meaningful experiments. The first wave of growth must be driven by founders themselves.

This challenges the common belief that hiring a "head of growth" will solve a startup's growth problems. Instead, founders must figure out how to make the product grow to their first $1M, $5M, or even $10M in ARR before outsourcing this to a dedicated function.

## How It Works

### Prerequisites for Growth Teams

Before hiring growth, you need two things:

1. **Solid Product-Market Fit**
   - A solution to a real problem
   - Customers not only coming in but retaining
   - Good retention metrics
   - High Sean Ellis score (people who can't live without your product)

2. **Sufficient Data**
   - Enough user volume to run experiments
   - Ability to create hypotheses and test them
   - More than "10 users" or a "G-sheet with your customers"

### Growth Team Timing by Go-to-Market Model

**For Sales-Led Companies:**
- Hire sales before growth
- Growth teams may not be needed at all in pure sales-led models
- "Growth marketing" in sales-led companies is often just rebranded demand gen
- Wait for growth until you're ready to overlay product-led elements

**For Product-Led Companies:**
- Growth hire can come earlier, potentially before sales
- Self-serve monetization requires growth thinking from the start
- Still need PMF and data first

**Hybrid Models:**
- If product acquires users (SEO, SEM) but sales closes them, you need both
- Growth comes in when any product-led component handles acquisition, activation, monetization, or retention

## How to Apply It

1. **Resist the urge to hire growth early**
   - The shiny resume won't wave a magic wand
   - Growth can't create PMF—only amplify it

2. **Own growth as a founder**
   - Figure out your distribution yourself
   - Learn what makes users retain
   - Understand your channels personally

3. **Check for readiness signals:**
   - Do you have retention?
   - Do you have enough volume to experiment?
   - Can you describe your PMF clearly?

4. **Consider waiting longer**
   - Some companies wait until $100M-$200M ARR
   - The longer you wait, the more the whole company learns growth responsibility
   - Growth teams can become islands if hired too early

5. **Train the whole company**
   - When founders own growth longer, the entire organization becomes responsible for growth
   - Avoids the "that's the growth team's job" mentality

## When to Use It

- When deciding whether to hire a head of growth
- When evaluating growth team timing for a startup
- When a board or investor suggests "you need growth"
- When tempted to outsource the growth problem

## Common Mistakes

- **Hiring growth to find PMF:** Growth can't find it for you
- **Hiring growth to fix a declining business:** They'll be destined to fail
- **Treating growth as a silver bullet:** No hire will solve fundamental product issues
- **Creating a growth "island":** Separating growth from product responsibility
