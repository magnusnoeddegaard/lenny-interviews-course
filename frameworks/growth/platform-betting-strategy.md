# Platform Betting Strategy

> "You're placing bets. At this part of the cycle, you're placing bets. The winner is not 100% guaranteed... essentially at some point you will need to make some decisions about where to place your bets." - Brian Balfour

## What It Is

Platform Betting Strategy is a framework for evaluating which emerging distribution platforms to invest in when multiple platforms are competing for dominance. It recognizes that choosing the right platform can make or break a company, but the "right" answer isn't obvious when platforms are still in competitive flux.

The framework addresses a common mistake: defaulting to the platform with the most users. History shows this is often wrong—Facebook was smaller than MySpace, Google was smaller than Yahoo. The winning platform is the one with the best retention and engagement, not the biggest current user count.

This framework also accounts for company stage: late-stage companies can spread bets, but startups must go all-in on a single platform choice.

## How It Works

### Four Evaluation Criteria

**1. Retention and Engagement Depth (Most Important)**
- Look for platforms with high long-term retention
- Retention curves that level off high indicate stickiness
- The "smile curve" (retention that increases over time) is the ultimate signal
- Better predictor than raw user numbers

**2. User Quality and Monetization Potential**
- Can you actually make money from users on this platform?
- iOS has 30% of devices but 70% of app revenue
- Android has 70% of devices but 30% of app revenue
- A smaller, higher-quality user base may be better

**3. Value Exchange Terms**
- What is the platform giving you to develop on it?
- Access to distribution channels?
- Context and data?
- Revenue sharing terms?
- Understand the arbitrage opportunities in the rules

**4. Scale and Momentum**
- Only relevant if the first three are comparable
- A 200x scale difference overrides other factors
- But 10x difference with worse retention/engagement may still lose

### Betting Strategy by Company Stage

**Late-Stage Companies:**
- Can afford to spread bets across multiple platforms
- Can wait to see which platform wins before going heavy
- Risk: waiting too long means missing the window entirely
- Approach: Place multiple bets, then consolidate when winner emerges

**Startups:**
- Cannot afford to spread bets
- Must pick one platform and go all-in
- Higher risk, higher potential reward
- Approach: Choose based on the four criteria and commit fully

### The Prisoner's Dilemma

A key insight: you cannot opt out of platform betting. If you don't play:

1. Competitors will take the new distribution
2. Customer expectations will shift to the new platform
3. You'll be forced to join late, at a disadvantage

> "There is no opting out of the game. You have to play the game." - Brian Balfour

## How to Apply It

### Step 1: Map the Landscape
- Identify all competing platforms in the space
- Note which are in Step Zero vs. Step One/Two of the platform cycle
- Understand what moat each platform is building

### Step 2: Score Each Platform

For each platform, evaluate:

| Criteria | Platform A | Platform B | Platform C |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Retention/Engagement | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low |
| User Quality | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low |
| Value Exchange | Favorable/Neutral/Unfavorable | ... | ... |
| Scale & Momentum | Growing/Flat/Declining | ... | ... |

### Step 3: Make Your Bet
- If you're a startup: pick the leader on criteria 1-3 and go all-in
- If you're established: invest proportionally across top 2-3 platforms
- Set a timeline for consolidating your bets

### Step 4: Plan the Exit
Even as you enter, plan for platform closure:
- How will you own the customer relationship?
- What data will you accumulate that's uniquely yours?
- What would you do if this platform closes tomorrow?

## When to Use It

- **Technology shifts**: When new platforms emerge (mobile, social, AI)
- **Distribution strategy**: Deciding where to build integrations
- **Resource allocation**: Determining engineering investment priorities
- **Strategic planning**: Annual/quarterly roadmap decisions
- **Competitive response**: Reacting to competitor platform moves
