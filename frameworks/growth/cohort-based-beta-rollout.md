# Cohort-Based Beta Rollout

> "The reason we did it that way was that we thought that if you just invite everyone at once or a lot of people at once, all of those people are going to probably hit the same problems in this kind of software that is very early stage... So we would just do these cohorts. Let's invite these people and then they say, hey, this is a problem. This doesn't work, or something. Then we go fix that. Then after we fix that, we invite the next cohort of people." - Karri Saarinen

## What It Is

Cohort-Based Beta Rollout is a product launch strategy where you invite users in small, sequential waves rather than all at once. Each cohort tests the product, provides feedback, and surfaces problems. The team fixes those issues before inviting the next cohort.

This approach maximizes learning efficiency during the critical early stages of a product. Instead of receiving the same bug report from hundreds of users simultaneously, you get it from the first ten, fix it, and the next cohort never experiences that problem.

Linear used this approach during their year-long private beta, starting with just 10 people per week and gradually increasing as the product stabilized.

## How It Works

**The Process:**

1. **Curate your waitlist** - Collect information that helps you prioritize (company size, tools used, stated interest level)

2. **Start with small cohorts** - Linear began with ~10 users per week

3. **Manual and personal outreach** - Linear's founder personally emailed invites and followed up after a week to ask for feedback

4. **Gather feedback from each cohort** - Identify what's broken, confusing, or missing

5. **Fix before the next wave** - Address the most critical issues before inviting more users

6. **Gradually increase cohort size** - As the product stabilizes, you can invite more users per wave

**Selection Criteria:**
- Start with users most likely to succeed with your current feature set
- Prioritize users who seem genuinely interested vs. just curious
- Match users to your current capabilities (e.g., only invite companies using integrations you support)

## How to Apply It

1. **Build a waitlist with context** - Don't just collect emails. Ask qualifying questions:
   - What tools do you currently use?
   - What's your company size?
   - Why are you interested in this product?

2. **Define your initial target cohort** - Who will get the most value from your product in its current state?

3. **Set a realistic cadence** - Balance speed of learning with capacity to fix issues. For a very early product, 10 users/week may be appropriate.

4. **Make it personal** - Early users should feel special. Personal emails from founders, direct access for questions, and genuine follow-up.

5. **Build feedback loops** - Create easy ways for cohort users to report issues. Follow up proactively—don't wait for them to complain.

6. **Track issues by cohort** - Note which problems each cohort encountered. You should see issue overlap decreasing as you fix things between waves.

7. **Know when to accelerate** - When new cohorts aren't finding significant new issues, you can increase cohort size or move toward general availability.

## When to Use It

**Ideal for:**
- Early-stage products with rough edges
- Products where first impressions matter
- B2B products where user time is valuable
- Teams with limited capacity to handle support
- Products with waitlist demand

**The efficiency argument:**
If 100 users all hit the same bug on day one, you've:
- Wasted 100 users' time
- Received 100 reports of the same issue
- Potentially created 100 disappointed users

With cohort-based rollout, you:
- Use 10 users to find the bug
- Fix it before the other 90 encounter it
- Create a better first experience for the majority

**Linear's timeline:**
- April 2019: Announced with waitlist
- June 2019: Started inviting users from waitlist
- June 2020: Public launch after ~1 year of cohort-based beta
- Result: "Almost all" companies subscribed to paid plans at launch
