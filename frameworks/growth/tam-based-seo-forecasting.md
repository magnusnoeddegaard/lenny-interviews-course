# TAM-Based SEO Forecasting

> "When you do this top-down, you're closer to the truth. Now, you probably aren't going to get to the truth. I've never seen a product plan get to the truth of what it could do, but it will help you make a better decision than if you just guess." - Eli Schwartz

## What It Is

TAM-Based SEO Forecasting is a top-down approach to sizing SEO opportunity that starts with market size rather than keyword search volumes. Traditional "bottoms-up" SEO forecasting uses keyword research tools to estimate traffic potential—but these tools are often wrong by factors of 10x in either direction.

Instead of asking "how many people search for this keyword?", this framework asks "how many people in my target market could potentially find me through search?" It applies TAM (Total Addressable Market) thinking to SEO planning.

## How It Works

**The Problem with Bottoms-Up Forecasting:**

1. You look up keyword search volumes in tools like Semrush, Ahrefs, or Similarweb
2. You estimate your potential ranking position and click-through rate
3. You multiply to get expected clicks, then apply a conversion rate
4. You "gross up" by 10x to account for long-tail keywords
5. **Result**: A number that's often wildly inaccurate because keyword tools are wrong

**The Top-Down Alternative:**

1. Start with your total market size (population, businesses, etc.)
2. Apply filters for your target segment (demographics, behaviors)
3. Estimate what percentage uses online search for this problem
4. Calculate your realistic market share capture
5. **Result**: A number you can actually defend and adjust

**Why Keyword Tools Fail:**

- Google doesn't share real search volumes (even for Google Ads)
- All tools use proprietary algorithms to estimate
- Tools often overestimate or underestimate by 10x
- Eli Schwartz worked with WordPress where every keyword tool had completely wrong numbers compared to Google Search Console

## How to Apply It

**Step 1: Define your market**
- Total population or businesses in your target geography
- Example: Japan has 100 million people

**Step 2: Apply segment filters**
- Gender, age, company size, industry, etc.
- Example: 50% male = 50 million; 50% of target age = 25 million

**Step 3: Filter for online behavior**
- What percentage buys this category online?
- What percentage uses search (vs. social, recommendations)?
- Example: 10% buy shoes online = 2.5 million potential searchers

**Step 4: Estimate market share**
- What share of online searchers can you realistically capture?
- Based on your competitive position and SEO strength
- Example: 10% market share = 250,000 potential customers

**Step 5: Calculate value**
- Multiply by average order value and purchase frequency
- This is your SEO opportunity ceiling

**Adjusting Over Time:**
- Unlike bottoms-up forecasts, you can go back and adjust any assumption
- "My AOV was wrong" or "Market share was lower than expected"
- Each variable can be tuned based on real data

## When to Use It

**TAM-Based Forecasting works best when:**

- You're entering a new market or geography
- You need to justify SEO investment to leadership
- Keyword tools give you numbers that seem too small (or too large)
- You want a defensible forecast you can adjust

**It's especially useful for:**

- International expansion planning
- New product launches
- Executive presentations and business cases
- Comparing SEO opportunity across markets

**Bottoms-up may still help for:**

- Understanding relative search demand (keyword A vs. B)
- Identifying how people phrase searches (user journey mapping)
- Normalizing data (not absolute numbers)

## Example Calculation

**Launching a shoe e-commerce site in Japan:**

| Step | Filter | Number |
|------|--------|--------|
| Total population | Japan | 100,000,000 |
| Target gender | Men only | 50,000,000 |
| Target age | 25-55 | 25,000,000 |
| Online shoe buyers | 10% buy online | 2,500,000 |
| Search channel | 40% use search | 1,000,000 |
| Market share | 10% capture | 100,000 |
| Annual purchases | 2x/year | 200,000 orders |
| AOV | $80 | **$16M opportunity** |

Each assumption can be challenged and refined, but you now have a framework for the conversation.
