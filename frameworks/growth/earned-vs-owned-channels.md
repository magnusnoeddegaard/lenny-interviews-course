# Earned vs Owned Channels

> "When you're doing organic search or paid search, you're making Google richer. Great for Google... But by dumping money into paid marketing, you are paying for their distribution. If you're doing social too, like you're doing Instagram or whatnot, that's great, but all of that works on algorithm. An algorithm can giveth, but algorithm can also taketh away at any point." - Elena Verna

## What It Is

Earned vs Owned Channels is a framework for prioritizing growth investments based on defensibility. While most growth teams focus on "rented" channels like SEO, SEM, and paid social, the most sustainable growth comes from "earned" or "owned" channels that competitors cannot buy their way into.

Earned channels include virality, word-of-mouth, user-generated content, and referrals—distribution mechanisms built into your product that compound over time and belong exclusively to you.

## How It Works

### Rented Channels (Lower Priority)
- **Paid Search (SEM):** You're paying Google for access to their distribution
- **Organic Search (SEO):** Content becomes a database for AI; the UI is changing
- **Paid Social:** Algorithm changes can wipe out your investment overnight
- **Display Advertising:** Competing for the same eyeballs as everyone else

**The Problem:** You have no control. You're competing in someone else's channel where competitors can match your spend.

### Earned/Owned Channels (Higher Priority)
- **Virality:** Users naturally invite others through product usage
- **User-Generated Content:** Templates, case studies, reviews created by users
- **Referrals:** Direct person-to-person recommendations
- **Community:** Conversations and content around your product
- **Word of Mouth:** Natural recommendations between people

**The Advantage:** Nobody else can compete in your earned channel. It's yours to lose.

### Real-World Example: Dropbox

> "At Dropbox, over 50% of acquisition comes through sharing. I load something into my Dropbox, maybe I need to send it out for signature. Maybe I need to share this file to transfer it to somebody... That recipient then is now aware of Dropbox, so it solved the brand awareness. By that action of sharing, you actually almost activated that recipient too. And the percentage of those recipients sign up to become Dropbox users."

This sharing loop:
- Accounts for 50%+ of acquisition
- Can't be competed with by rivals
- Has been firing for 17+ years
- Has its own dedicated growth pod

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your channel mix**
   - What percentage comes from rented vs owned channels?
   - How vulnerable are you to algorithm changes?

2. **Identify earned channel opportunities**
   - **Team functionality:** Can teammates invite others?
   - **Sharing mechanisms:** What gets shared from your product?
   - **User-generated content:** Can users create value others want?
   - **Referrals:** What would motivate users to recommend you?

3. **Invest in product-led acquisition**
   - Build virality into the product
   - Create shareable artifacts
   - Enable user-generated content libraries
   - Build community around your product

4. **Allocate resources appropriately**
   - Don't abandon rented channels entirely
   - Diversify so you're not dependent on any single channel
   - Invest 20-25% of growth team time annually on new earned channels

## When to Use It

- During growth strategy planning
- When evaluating acquisition channel investments
- When concerned about CAC increasing
- When relying heavily on SEO and worried about AI disruption
- When budgeting growth team focus areas

## Applicability

Elena notes that earned channels apply to more products than people realize:

- Almost every product has team functionality
- Almost every product can drive word-of-mouth loops
- Almost every product can create user-generated content
- If one tactic doesn't apply, another likely does

The key is exploring these options rather than defaulting to rented channels.
