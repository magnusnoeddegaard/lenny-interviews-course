# Be Someone's Favorite

> "Be you, be authentic. Try to be someone's favorite. Don't try to be everyone's okay podcast." - Chris Hutchins

## What It Is

Be Someone's Favorite is a content strategy principle that prioritizes depth over breadth. Instead of creating content that appeals moderately to a wide audience, focus on creating content that a smaller group of people will love deeply.

The logic is rooted in how word-of-mouth and audience building actually work: people who merely like something won't share it, write reviews, or become advocates. But people who love something—whose favorite you've become—will actively recommend you, engage with you, and help you grow.

This principle applies to podcasts, newsletters, products, and any creative endeavor where audience building matters.

## How It Works

**The Math of "Okay" vs. "Favorite":**
- 100 people who think you're "okay" = minimal sharing, no reviews, passive consumption
- 10 people who think you're their favorite = active sharing, reviews, suggestions, engagement, advocacy

**Why It Works:**
Tim Ferriss shared that he did an episode about how to make violins—a niche topic that 80% of his audience didn't care about. But 20% thought it was one of the best episodes he'd done that year. Half of his top 10 all-time episodes feature people most listeners wouldn't recognize.

This counterintuitive finding—that niche content often performs best—validates the "be someone's favorite" approach.

**The 1,000 True Fans Connection:**
This framework connects directly to Kevin Kelly's "1,000 True Fans" concept. True fans are people who will buy anything you produce, attend your events, and recommend you to others. You build true fans by being their favorite, not by being generally acceptable.

## How to Apply It

1. **Stop optimizing for broad appeal** - Resist the temptation to water down your perspective to avoid alienating anyone.

2. **Pursue your genuine curiosities** - Create content about topics that deeply interest you, even if they seem niche. Your enthusiasm will resonate with the right audience.

3. **Survey your audience** - Ask which piece of content was their favorite. If almost every piece is someone's favorite, you're doing it right.

4. **Measure engagement, not just reach** - A smaller, highly engaged audience is more valuable than a larger, passive one.

5. **Create intimacy** - Podcasting is especially suited to this because it's an intimate medium—you're in someone's ear while they go about their life. Lean into that intimacy rather than broadcasting generically.

6. **Be consistent** - People want to make you part of their routine. Release on a consistent schedule so you become "Wednesday morning's episode."

**Validation Test:**
Survey your audience after 50 episodes/posts/releases. If every piece is at least one person's favorite, you've achieved what matters.

## When to Use It

- Choosing topics for content creation
