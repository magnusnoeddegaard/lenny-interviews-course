# Opinionated Defaults

> "Making it hard to do the wrong thing when you're setting up your Patreon page and easy to do the right thing—but not eliminating choice. The creator could still make the choice to do the wrong thing... but we made it difficult for them." - Adam Fishman

## What It Is

Opinionated Defaults is a product design principle for onboarding and activation flows. Instead of presenting users with blank slates or neutral choices, you pre-configure settings based on what you know works best—while still allowing users to change them if they insist.

The key distinction: you're not removing choice, you're adding friction to bad choices and removing friction from good ones. Users can still do the "wrong" thing, but they have to work harder to do it.

Adam Fishman developed this principle at Patreon, where they learned from hundreds of thousands of creators what configurations led to success, then built those learnings into the default product experience.

## How It Works

### The Learning Loop

1. **Observe at scale** - Analyze what successful users do differently from unsuccessful users
2. **Identify patterns** - Find the specific configurations, settings, or behaviors that correlate with success
3. **Make those the defaults** - Pre-configure new users with the winning settings
4. **Add friction to bad choices** - Make it harder (not impossible) to deviate from best practices

### The Key Principle

**Don't eliminate choice—add friction strategically**

| User Action | Default Experience | If User Insists |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Good choice | Frictionless | N/A |
| Bad choice | Friction (warnings, extra steps) | Still possible |

## How to Apply It

### Step 1: Learn What Works

Use human intervention first to discover patterns:
- At Patreon, human "creator success" reps worked with high-potential creators
- They learned what advice led to better outcomes
- They identified specific configurations that worked

### Step 2: Identify Specific Levers

Examples from Patreon:
- **Tier structure**: 3-5 tiers worked better than 1 tier or 40 tiers
- **Entry pricing**: $3-5 entry points worked better than $1
- **Page copy**: Certain ways of describing your Patreon performed better

### Step 3: Build Into Product

Make good choices the path of least resistance:
- Pre-populate with recommended tier structure
- Default to recommended pricing
- Show templates based on what works

### Step 4: Add Friction to Deviations

When users try to deviate:
- Show warnings explaining why the default is recommended
- Require extra confirmation steps
- Surface data on what typically works

**But don't block them entirely**—some users have legitimate reasons to deviate.

## When to Use It

- **Onboarding flows** - Users are most motivated and most malleable
- **Configuration screens** - Where many wrong choices are possible
- **Setup wizards** - Where complexity could overwhelm new users
- **Pricing/packaging** - Where you have data on what converts and retains

## Real Examples

### Patreon Tier Structure
- **Learning**: Creators with 3-5 tiers retained better and earned more than those with 1 tier or 40 tiers
- **Default**: Pre-configure 3 tiers with recommended pricing
- **Friction**: If creator tries to add a 6th tier or delete down to 1, show warning with data

### Airbnb Calendar Settings (Smart Defaults)
- **Learning**: New hosts with open calendars get booked for dates they can't host, then churn
- **Default**: Block calendar for new hosts or configure based on host type (pro vs. mom-and-pop)
- **Result**: Better first experiences, higher retention

## Why Onboarding Matters

Adam's case for investing in onboarding:

1. **100% touch rate** - It's the only part of your product everyone uses
2. **First impression** - First chance to deliver on your brand promise
3. **Peak motivation** - Users are most willing to push through friction here
4. **Retention driver** - Early habit formation determines long-term retention

> "Your brand is the promise that you're making and your product experience is your delivery of that promise. Those two things have to be in lockstep."

## Productizing Human Learnings

The Opinionated Defaults pattern often follows this sequence:

1. **Human intervention** - Manually guide high-value users
2. **Learn patterns** - Identify what advice/guidance leads to success
3. **Productize** - Build those learnings into the product as defaults
4. **Scale** - Now all users benefit, not just those with human support

At Patreon, this sequence improved creator first/second month revenue by 25%.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Neutral defaults** - Presenting blank slates when you have data on what works
2. **Hard blocks** - Removing choice entirely instead of adding friction
3. **Ignoring learnings** - Not building insights from support/success teams into product
4. **One-size-fits-all** - Not segmenting defaults by user type when appropriate
