# Kindle vs Fire Strategies

> "The goal of your kindle strategies, these like non-scalable hacks, they only exist to unlock the fire strategies, to unlock the things that could take you to millions of users." - Casey Winters

## What It Is

A framework for separating early growth tactics into two distinct categories: kindle strategies (non-scalable hacks that get you started) and fire strategies (scalable loops that drive real growth). The key insight is that kindle strategies have one job: to unlock fire strategies.

Kindle strategies include things like manual outreach, personal network activation, content that doesn't scale, and hustling for early users. Fire strategies include content loops, viral loops, sales loops, and paid acquisition—things that can take you to millions of users.

## How It Works

### Kindle Strategies (Non-Scalable Hacks)
- Getting early users through personal connections
- Manual processes that prove a concept
- One-to-one sales or outreach
- Community building through personal engagement
- PR and launch tactics
- Founder-led sales

**Purpose**: Prove the model works and unlock the fire strategy

### Fire Strategies (Scalable Growth)
- **Content loops** - SEO, user-generated content that drives organic discovery
- **Viral loops** - Product features that drive sharing and referrals
- **Sales loops** - Repeatable sales motions with predictable unit economics
- **Paid acquisition** - Paid channels with positive ROI

**Purpose**: Scale to millions of users

### The Sequencing
1. Use kindle strategies to get initial traction
2. Learn what works and what resonates
3. Identify which fire strategy your product can unlock
4. Focus kindle efforts specifically on unlocking that fire strategy
5. Once fire is lit, shift resources to scaling it

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your current tactics** - Classify everything you're doing as kindle or fire. If you're past early stage and still mostly doing kindle, you have a problem.

2. **Define your target fire strategy** - What scalable loop could your product support? Content? Viral? Sales? Paid?

3. **Align kindle to fire** - Make sure your non-scalable hacks are specifically designed to prove and unlock your fire strategy, not just to get any users.

4. **Hire for fire** - When you unlock a fire strategy, hire specialists who can pour gasoline on it:
   - Sales loops → salespeople
   - Viral/content → growth PM
   - Paid → performance marketer

5. **Know when to transition** - Don't stay in kindle mode too long. Once you've proven the fire strategy works, shift resources aggressively.

## When to Use It

- **Pre-product market fit**: You're in pure kindle mode—focus on learning what fire strategy you can unlock
- **Found PMF but not scaling**: You need to identify and ignite your fire strategy
- **Hiring for growth**: Match the role to your fire strategy type
- **Resource allocation**: Ensure kindle effort is purposeful, not just activity
