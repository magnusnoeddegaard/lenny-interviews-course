# Dam the Demand

> "In category design, we don't compete, period, full stop at the brand to brand or product to product level. Category designers do compete, but not against a product, not against a company, not against a brand. Category designers compete against the status quo." — Christopher Lochhead

## What It Is

Dam the Demand is a competitive strategy where you intercept and redirect demand from an existing category to a new category you've designed, rather than competing head-to-head with products in the existing category.

Like a dam that stops water flowing in one direction and redirects it, category designers stop demand flowing toward existing solutions by reframing the problem in a way that makes their new category the logical answer.

The key insight: category designers don't compete product-to-product. They compete against "the way things are now"—the status quo.

## How It Works

**How Dams Work**: A physical dam takes water running in one direction, stops it, and does something with it—changes its direction, stores it, generates power. Dam the Demand does the same thing with customer intent.

**The Cycling Example**:
- **Road biking** is a category. But people get injured or killed cycling with traffic.
- **Spinning** created a new category: indoor biking classes. Their message: "Why risk your life on a bike when you can take a wonderful class and not have to worry about it?"
- Spinning didn't compete with specific bike brands. They dammed the demand flowing toward outdoor cycling by reframing the problem.
- **Peloton** then dammed Spinning's demand: "Why drive to the gym when you could do it at home?" They didn't attack Spinning's bikes as inferior—they reframed the problem again.

**Category-to-Category vs Brand-to-Brand**:
- Brand-to-brand: "Our bikes are 12 mega flips faster and cheaper than theirs" → Fighting for 24%
- Category-to-category: "You thought you wanted X, but what you really need is Y" → Creating new demand

**The Electric Guitar Example**:
Les Paul created the electric guitar. Very few guitarists said "Fuck the acoustic guitar" after that. Instead, the new category (electric guitars) actually increased the total guitar TAM. This is dam the demand combined with market expansion—you're both capturing redirected demand AND creating new demand.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify the status quo you're competing against**
   - Don't think about competitor products
   - Think about the current way people solve the problem
   - What are the inherent limitations or frustrations of that approach?

2. **Find the wedge**
   - What's wrong with the current category that creates an opening?
   - Spinning: Risk of injury/death in outdoor cycling
   - Peloton: Inconvenience of driving to the gym
   - The wedge should be emotionally compelling

3. **Reframe the problem to position your category**
   - "You thought you wanted [current solution]..."
   - "...but what you really need is [your category]"
   - Don't attack competitors—present a different way of thinking about the problem

4. **Communicate the from → to (Froto)**
   - Show the world moving FROM the current way
   - TO your new and different way
   - Make the gap emotionally and logically compelling

5. **Let existing category do your marketing**
   - People already want the outcome the existing category provides
   - You're offering a better way to that outcome
   - This is why "dam" works—you're redirecting existing intent

## When to Use It

Dam the Demand is ideal when:

- **An existing category has known limitations** that frustrate users
- **You can reframe the problem** in a way that makes your solution obviously better
- **There's significant existing demand** you can redirect (you need water to dam)
- **You want to avoid head-to-head competition** with established players
- **Your innovation changes how the problem should be thought about**, not just how it's solved

Dam the Demand is NOT ideal when:
- There's no established category to dam (you're creating demand from scratch)
- The existing category satisfies users well (no wedge to exploit)
- You're making incremental improvements within the existing category
- Your differentiation is features/price within the same problem-framing
