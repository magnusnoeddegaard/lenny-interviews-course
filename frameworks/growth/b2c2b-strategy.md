# B2C2B Strategy

> "Half our B2B customers coming from prior personal users, and most of them are using Notion for notes and documents in the first place... they bring Notion to work." - Ivan Zhao

## What It Is

B2C2B (Business to Consumer to Business) is a go-to-market strategy where you acquire individual consumers who then bring your product into their workplaces, converting personal usage into enterprise revenue.

Notion discovered this pattern organically. They built a product for consumers who use it for the simplest possible use case—note-taking and documents. These users then discover that Notion can do more (relational databases, task management, project tracking). Finally, they bring Notion into their workplace, becoming the internal champion that converts a consumer product into a B2B sale.

The key insight is that the consumer entry point matters enormously. Note-taking and documents represent a universal use case with over a billion potential users—a massive top of funnel. This volume of personal users then naturally filters into enterprise opportunities without expensive sales efforts.

## How It Works

B2C2B operates through a predictable sequence:

1. **Consumer hook**: Users discover your product for a simple, universal use case (notes, calendar, email) that they use personally

2. **Value discovery**: Through continued usage, they realize the product can solve more complex problems

3. **Workplace introduction**: Users bring the product to work, initially for their own productivity

4. **Organic spread**: Colleagues see the product working, start using it themselves

5. **Enterprise conversion**: Usage hits a threshold where the company needs official licenses, integrations, and admin controls

The model works because the consumer usage proves product value before any sales conversation happens. Half of Notion's B2B customers were already personal users—they sold themselves.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your billion-user use case** - Find the universal job that everyone does. For Notion, it's notes and docs. What simple, personal use case overlaps with your product's domain?

2. **Design for personal before professional** - Make the product work for individuals first. The workplace version comes from upgrading personal users, not from separate enterprise features.

3. **Enable easy work introduction** - Remove friction for users who want to share with colleagues. Make it trivial to invite teammates, share projects, or demonstrate value.

4. **Build progressive complexity** - Let users discover advanced capabilities gradually. Don't front-load enterprise features that scare away consumers.

5. **Measure the C2B conversion** - Track what percentage of your enterprise customers started as personal users. This reveals whether your consumer funnel is actually fueling B2B growth.

## When to Use It

- When building horizontal productivity tools with broad applicability
- When your product has a universal personal use case (docs, calendar, email, task management)
- When you want to reduce customer acquisition costs for enterprise sales
- When you believe bottom-up adoption beats top-down sales
- When expanding from consumer to enterprise markets
