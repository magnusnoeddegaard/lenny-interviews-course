# Marketplace Commission Evolution

> "If you put [commission rate vs founding year] on the x and y axis, there's this very clear up into the right trend. Newer marketplaces are charging higher commissions and they're doing more work to justify those commissions." - Dan Hockenmaier

## What It Is

Marketplace business models have evolved over time from simple demand aggregation (low commissions) to deeply managed experiences (high commissions). Understanding this progression helps predict where markets are headed and where opportunities exist.

The pattern reveals a fundamental truth: you can charge more when you do more work in the value chain.

## How It Works

### The Evolution Stages

**Marketplace 1.0: Lead Generation (5-10% commission)**
Examples: Zillow, HomeAdvisor

What they do:
- Aggregate demand
- Connect buyers to sellers
- Minimal transaction involvement

Why commissions are low:
- Limited value add beyond demand
- Easy to disintermediate
- Commodity service

**Marketplace 2.0: Managed Marketplace (10-15% commission)**
Examples: Airbnb, Etsy

What they do:
- Aggregate demand
- Generate trust between parties
- Vet supply quality
- Handle payments/reviews

Why commissions are higher:
- Transaction safety has real value
- Trust building is hard to replicate
- Reduced friction for both sides

**Marketplace 3.0: Heavily Managed Marketplace (15-30%+ commission)**
Examples: DoorDash, Instacart, Faire

What they do:
- Everything from 2.0
- Own logistics (delivery, fulfillment)
- Underwrite transactions (take default risk)
- Provide financing/credit

Why commissions are highest:
- Deep value chain integration
- Operations create switching costs
- Hard to replicate capabilities

### The Endpoint Question

What happens at 100% commission? You're not a marketplace anymore—you own the supply.

This raises strategic questions about which marketplaces will evolve out of the marketplace model entirely.

## How to Apply It

1. **Map Your Value Chain Position**
   - What work do you do beyond demand aggregation?
   - Where could you do more?

2. **Identify Commission Ceiling**
   - What's the maximum commission your model supports?
   - What would you need to add to raise it?

3. **Watch for Consolidation Signals**
   - In your market, are winners likely to own supply eventually?
   - Or is creativity/variety essential to customer value?

4. **Time Your Market Entry**
   - Earlier stage = compete on doing more
   - Later stage = compete on doing it better

## The Creativity Variable

Which marketplaces stay as marketplaces vs consolidate depends on creativity:

**Consolidation likely when:**
- Customers want standardization and reliability
- Experience quality matters more than variety
- Supply is fungible/commodity

Example: Ride-sharing → autonomous vehicles will consolidate the market. You don't need human drivers' "creativity."

**Marketplace persists when:**
- Customers want creative variety
- New products/ideas are essential
- Supply differentiation drives value

Example: Etsy, Amazon, Faire, Steam—customers want interesting new things that big companies can't create internally.

## Key Insight: Own Supply = End of Marketplace

When you fully own supply, you're no longer a marketplace:

> "There's no supplier on the other side. They've already bought the house so it's just e-commerce."

Opendoor looks like a real estate marketplace but is actually e-commerce—they own the inventory. This is the logical endpoint when supply commoditizes.

## The DoorDash Question

Some markets are ambiguous:

> "I don't exactly know how to call what happens in food delivery. You do want some standardization elements, but you also want the local restaurants."

Does DoorDash become the kitchen (ghost kitchens) or remain a platform for local creativity? The answer likely varies by segment.
