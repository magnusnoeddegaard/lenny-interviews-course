# Metric-Driven Team Structure

> "When you can be really laser focused on, my goal each quarter is to make this metric go up, I think it's much easier to make sure that you're working on the highest ROI thing. When you think more about like, 'I want to make this feature better,' I think it's easier to get lost in what better means." - Jackson Shuttleworth

## What It Is

Metric-Driven Team Structure is an organizational model where teams are assigned ownership of metrics rather than features. Instead of "the streaks team," Duolingo has "the CURR (retention) team" that happens to work heavily on streaks because streaks drive CURR better than anything else.

This structure prevents feature territorialism, focuses teams on impact over output, and creates natural collaboration when features span multiple metrics.

## How It Works

### Team Assignment

Instead of:
- "Streaks Team" owns the streak feature
- "Leaderboards Team" owns leaderboards
- "Notifications Team" owns push notifications

You have:
- "CURR Team" owns current user retention rate
- "Time on App Team" owns session duration
- "Monetization Team" owns revenue per user

### Soft Feature Ownership

Teams develop expertise in features that drive their metric:
- CURR team knows streaks deeply (because streaks drive CURR)
- But they don't block others from touching streaks
- If monetization team wants to add streak freeze purchases, they collaborate

### Cross-Team Collaboration Model

When Team B wants to modify Team A's domain:
1. Team B shares their hypothesis
2. Team A shares context: what they've learned, what's planned
3. Teams find a simpler version that achieves both goals
4. Knowledge transfer prevents reinventing failures

### Roadmap Implications

- Teams have "soft ownership" of high-leverage features
- Roadmaps are built around metric opportunities, not feature wishlists
- Experimentation resources flow to highest-impact areas

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your core metrics**
   - What are the 3-5 metrics that drive your business?
   - Which team movements would have the most leverage?
   - Map metrics to business outcomes (DAU, revenue, etc.)

2. **Assign team ownership**
   - Each team owns one primary metric
   - Teams can have secondary metrics for balance
   - Create clear accountability for metric movement

3. **Establish collaboration protocols**
   - How do teams request access to others' domains?
   - What knowledge must be shared before experiments?
   - Who resolves conflicts when features span metrics?

4. **Align incentives with metrics**
   - Performance evaluation based on metric impact
   - Not penalized for features shipped or not shipped
   - Rewarded for learning, even from failed experiments

5. **Maintain feature expertise**
   - Even without ownership, teams develop deep domain knowledge
   - Document learnings for future cross-team work
   - Build institutional memory around key features

## When to Use It

- When feature teams are becoming territorial
- When "better" has become undefined
- When teams ship features without clear impact
- When scaling a growth organization
- When prioritization debates are consuming energy

## Example: Duolingo's Structure

| Team | Metric | Primary Features |
|------|--------|------------------|
| Retention | CURR | Streaks, reminders, freezes |
| Engagement | Time on App | Leaderboards, lessons |
| Monetization | Revenue | Super subscription, purchases |
| Growth | New Users | Onboarding, acquisition |

The Retention team doesn't "own" streaks—they own CURR. Streaks are their primary lever because it works. If something else worked better, they'd shift.
