# Product-Driven Revenue

> "We actually track a metric that we call product-driven revenue, which basically accounts for all revenue in customers where we saw meaningful value-based activity in the product before there was any sales contact. And that really tells actually a super interesting story about the PLG efficiency of your company across all revenue channels, self-serve and sales-led." - Ben Williams

## What It Is

A metric that captures the total contribution of product-led growth to revenue—not just self-serve revenue, but all revenue where the product created qualified demand before sales got involved. This gives a complete picture of PLG's impact across both self-serve and sales-led motions.

The key insight: In a product-led sales (PLS) model, even deals closed by sales often originated from users who experienced product value first. Tracking only self-serve revenue dramatically underestimates PLG's contribution.

## How It Works

### Definition
Revenue from customers where **meaningful value-based activity** occurred in the product **before** any sales contact.

### Components
- Self-serve revenue (obviously product-driven)
- Sales-assisted revenue where product engagement came first
- Expansion revenue from product-qualified accounts

### What It Measures
- The "PLG efficiency" of your company
- How well the product creates qualified demand
- The true ROI of product-led investments

### Key Finding at Snyk
> "What's fascinating there is that the product-driven cohort contributes a relatively greater amount to net retention."

Product-driven customers don't just convert better—they expand and retain better too.

## How to Apply It

1. **Define "meaningful value-based activity"** - What product engagement indicates real value realization, not just tire-kicking? For Snyk, this might be fixing vulnerabilities.

2. **Track first sales contact timing** - Log when sales first reaches out to or engages with an account.

3. **Compare activity timestamps** - For each closed deal, determine: did meaningful product activity precede sales contact?

4. **Segment your revenue** - Split total revenue into product-driven vs. sales-originated cohorts.

5. **Track downstream metrics** - Compare retention, expansion, and NRR between cohorts.

6. **Use for investment decisions** - Higher product-driven revenue and better downstream metrics justify more PLG investment.

## When to Use It

- When you have both self-serve and sales-led revenue
- When running a product-led sales (PLS) motion
- When deciding how to invest in PLG vs. traditional sales
- When measuring the true impact of growth team work
- When packaging decisions need to balance short-term revenue vs. long-term PLG efficiency
