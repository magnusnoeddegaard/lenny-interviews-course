# Organic Growth Threshold

> "A good metric is that 40 to 50% of your new customers should ideally come from organic channels and 50% from paid. If 90% come from paid, that means at some point that the music is going to stop." - Gokul Rajaram

## What It Is

The Organic Growth Threshold is a simple health metric for customer acquisition: at least 40-50% of new customers should come from organic channels (word of mouth, referrals, direct traffic, earned media). If you're over-reliant on paid acquisition - especially if 90%+ comes from paid - you've built a fundamentally unsustainable growth engine.

Gokul developed this observation from watching consumer companies struggle when they couldn't pay their way to growth anymore. The root problem isn't the paid channels themselves - it's that over-reliance on paid signals a product that isn't remarkable enough to spread on its own.

## How It Works

### The Math of Over-Reliance

When 90%+ of customers come from paid:
- You're one algorithm change away from disaster
- Your CAC will continuously rise as channels mature
- Competitors can outbid you at any time
- You have no moat beyond capital

### What Organic Represents

High organic acquisition signals:
- **Remarkability** - People are talking about your product
- **Value delivery** - Users get enough value to recommend
- **Product-market fit** - The product solves a real problem well
- **Sustainable economics** - Growth can continue without unlimited spend

### The Warning Signs

Companies that fall below the threshold often exhibit:
- Continuous CAC increases with no ceiling in sight
- Panic when Facebook or Google change algorithms
- Inability to explain why customers should recommend them
- Lack of investment in product-led growth mechanisms

## How to Apply It

1. **Measure your current mix** - What percentage comes from paid vs. organic channels?

2. **Define organic broadly:**
   - Word of mouth / referrals
   - Direct traffic
   - Organic search
   - Earned media/PR
   - Community-driven acquisition

3. **If below 40% organic, ask hard questions:**
   - Is our product remarkable enough?
   - Do users have a reason to talk about us?
   - What would make someone recommend us?

4. **Invest in remarkability** - Build features and experiences that naturally generate conversation

5. **Track organic separately** - Monitor organic as a leading indicator of product health

## When to Use It

- Evaluating acquisition strategy health
- Planning growth investments
- Assessing product-market fit
- Due diligence on potential investments
- Diagnosing why CAC keeps rising

## The Root Cause

Gokul traces over-reliance on paid back to product fundamentals:

> "The biggest thing you did wrong initially was you didn't pay enough attention to organic growth. Basically, was this product compelling enough that people talk about it and bring other people along?"

The 40/50 threshold isn't just a metric - it's a diagnostic for whether you've built something worth talking about.
