# Early User Experience Focus

> "Very often I think the biggest wins in retention come from inflecting the early user experience...in that very first experience, you have a lot of opportunity to teach them about why this is a valuable product and kind of prove to them that it's valuable." - Dan Hockenmaier

## What It Is

When teams want to improve retention, they often focus on re-engaging churned users or optimizing later stages of the user journey. But the highest leverage point for retention is usually the early user experience—the first week or month when opinions are forming and habits are being built.

Churned users have already decided they don't want your product. New users are still learning what it does.

## How It Works

### The Opinion Formation Window

At 3, 6, or 12 months, customers have formed strong opinions:
- They know if they like the product
- They understand how it works
- Changing their mind is difficult

In the first experience:
- Everything is new and plastic
- First impressions shape long-term behavior
- Small improvements have outsized impact

### The Resurrection Trap

> "You often see product teams say we should work on resurrection because we have this huge pool of users that is churned out. If we get just 1% of those people back, it's going to be such a big lift."

The problem:
- These users tried the product and decided they don't want it
- Convincing them otherwise is very hard
- The math sounds good but rarely plays out

The alternative:
- Focus on new users who haven't decided yet
- Improve their experience before they make up their minds
- Exhaust early-funnel efforts before spinning up resurrection

### The Variability Lens

One powerful approach: look for variability in early experience.

Example from ride-sharing:
- Some new drivers get lucky (busy areas, no cancellations)
- Some get unlucky (slow start, customer cancellations)
- The unlucky ones think "I make $3/hour on this platform"
- They never come back, even though their experience wasn't representative

Solution: guarantee first-week earnings to eliminate unlucky outcomes and show true platform value.

## How to Apply It

1. **Map the First Experience**
   - What happens in a user's first hour? First day? First week?
   - Where might they have a poor experience by chance?

2. **Find Experience Variability**
   - Which users have bad first experiences but shouldn't?
   - What random factors create poor outcomes?

3. **Homogenize Early Experience**
   - Reduce variance in early outcomes
   - Pull below-average experiences up to average
   - Guarantee or subsidize early value if needed

4. **Prove Value Quickly**
   - What's the core "aha" moment?
   - How fast can you get new users there?
   - What barriers delay that moment?

5. **Sequence Investments Correctly**
   - Start with early funnel optimization
   - Move to resurrection only after exhausting early wins

## When to Use It

- **Retention improvement projects**: Start here, not with churned users
- **Resource allocation**: Prioritize early experience over late-stage engagement
- **Marketplace onboarding**: Reduce bad luck for new supply and demand
- **Experiment prioritization**: Weight early-funnel tests more heavily

## Key Insight: Prove, Don't Persuade

The goal of early experience optimization isn't to convince users through marketing—it's to show them proof of value.

> "What they're trying to do is prove to you that this is what the experience is going to be like longer term, and you pull up all those below average first experiences to average and drive much better retention curves going forward."

Show, don't tell. Let the product prove itself.

## The Correlation Trap

Dan warns against a common analytical mistake:

> "One of the most common analytical failure modes is this pattern, which is our best users do X, so why can't we make other users do that same thing and then drive future retention. It almost never works that way because there's something unique about that customer."

Users who retain have different characteristics from users who don't. Making non-retaining users act like retaining users rarely works—the causality usually runs the other direction.
