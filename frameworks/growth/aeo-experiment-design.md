# AEO Experiment Design

> "Most best practices, most blog posts are not correct. So how do you set up an experiment? You get your questions, you turn tracking on, give it a couple of weeks. Make your changes, have a test group, have a control group. Intervene on the test group, make your changes, see if the chart went up." - Ethan Smith

## What It Is

AEO Experiment Design is a rigorous methodology for testing whether Answer Engine Optimization tactics actually work. Because most SEO and AEO advice online is untested misinformation, this framework helps you validate tactics before scaling them.

The core problem: in SEO and AEO, most information gets repeated without analysis. Someone says something, it becomes "best practice," and no one ever validates it. The solution is structured experimentation with proper controls.

## How It Works

**Why Control Groups Matter for AEO**:
1. LLM answers have natural variance—asking the same question produces different answers
2. LLM adoption is growing rapidly, so traffic increases even without intervention
3. External factors affect results (algorithm changes, competitor activity, seasonality)

Without a control group, you might falsely attribute natural variance to your intervention.

**Experiment Structure**:

```
Questions Pool: 200 questions

Control Group: 100 questions
- No intervention
- Track for baseline variance

Test Group: 100 questions
- Apply specific intervention (Reddit comments, YouTube videos, etc.)
- Track same metrics
```

## How to Apply It

### Step 1: Setup (Week 1-2)
1. Select 200+ target questions
2. Set up tracking across LLM surfaces
3. Establish baseline metrics for 2+ weeks
4. Randomly assign to test and control groups

### Step 2: Intervention (Week 3-4)
1. Apply one specific tactic to test group only
2. Examples of testable interventions:
   - Comment on Reddit threads for test questions
   - Create YouTube/Vimeo videos
   - Pay affiliate to include product in lists
   - Optimize landing page content

### Step 3: Measurement (Week 5-6)
1. Compare test vs control group changes
2. Key metrics:
   - Share of voice (% of time appearing in answers)
   - Average rank when appearing
   - Citation frequency

### Step 4: Validation
1. Did test group improve more than control?
2. Is the effect size meaningful?
3. **Reproduce the experiment** to confirm results

### The Reproducibility Requirement

> "For something to truly be accepted with an academian, it needs to be reproducible. Multiple people have done this study and reproduced that thing over and over again. Especially in SEO, it's common for something to change and you think that it was this thing that caused it and it's actually not."

- Run the experiment multiple times
- Try to reproduce results from other sources
- If a tactic works 10 times, it probably works

## What to Test

| Tactic | Intervention | Measurement |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Reddit | Comment on threads in test group only | Share of voice change |
| YouTube | Create videos for test questions only | Citation frequency |
| Affiliate | Pay for inclusion on test topics only | Rank improvement |
| Landing pages | Optimize pages for test questions only | Appearance rate |
| Help center | Add content for test use cases only | Long-tail coverage |

## When to Use It

- Before scaling any AEO tactic
- When evaluating advice from blogs or consultants
- When trying new citation sources
- After algorithm changes to validate tactics still work

**Warning signs you need better experiments**:
- You're scaling tactics you've never validated
- You're following "best practices" without evidence
- Results seem to change randomly
- You can't explain why something worked
