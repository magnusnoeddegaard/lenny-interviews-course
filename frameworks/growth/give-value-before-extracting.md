# Give Value Before You Extract Value

> "One of the principles that guides our thinking and our strategy is give value before you extract value. And I think that was at the core of inbound marketing at its inception, that outbound marketing was asking for something from customers or prospects before giving anything." - Christopher Miller

## What It Is

This principle is the philosophical foundation of both inbound marketing and product-led growth. It inverts the traditional sales model: instead of asking customers for their time, attention, or money first, you lead by providing genuine, sustainable value for free.

HubSpot applied this principle twice in their evolution. First through content marketing (eBooks, listicles, white papers), then through freemium software (free CRM, free marketing tools). In both cases, the free offering creates genuine value - not a gimmick that runs out on day one.

## How It Works

The framework creates a sustainable flywheel:

1. **Attract**: Free value draws customers who have the problems you solve
2. **Engage**: Customers use your free offering and experience genuine benefit
3. **Convert**: As usage deepens, customers hit natural upgrade points
4. **Delight**: Happy customers become advocates who attract more prospects

**Key principle**: The free offering must be legitimately valuable on its own, not a crippled teaser. As Miller explains: "This software is not gimmicky. It's not designed to run out of value on day one. It's actually designed so that our smallest customers can get some value out of it in a sustainable way."

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify real value to give away** - What can you offer that solves a genuine problem, not just a sample?
2. **Make free sustainable** - Design limits around scale/power, not around making free unusable
3. **Trust the upgrade path** - If you deliver value, customers will naturally want more as they grow
4. **Map free to paid journeys** - Understand how free users graduate to paid (usage, team size, features)
5. **Avoid extraction traps** - Don't gate basic functionality or frustrate free users into upgrading
6. **Measure engagement, not just signups** - Focus on whether free users are actually getting value

## When to Use It

This principle works best when:

- **Your product can demonstrate value without human help**: Self-service activation is possible
- **Network effects or habits drive stickiness**: Free users become harder to displace over time
- **Upgrade triggers are natural**: Growth, team size, or usage naturally drive paid needs
- **Category awareness is low**: Free products educate the market about your value proposition
- **Competition is intense**: Removing purchase friction differentiates you

**Consider carefully if**:
- Your product requires significant implementation or training
- Deal sizes are large enough to justify sales involvement
- Security/compliance requirements need human assurance
