# Milestone-Based KPIs

> "At a given milestone, unless they've reached that value moment, you can't keep them on the train to something else. If they haven't even discovered that really, to them, most valued part of their product, you would need to focus on getting them to that value. Otherwise, you can't just keep firing off emails and hoping they're going to jump back into the product as if they're going to care." - Gia Laudi

## What It Is

Milestone-Based KPIs is a measurement framework that defines success metrics at each value milestone in the customer journey, not just at traditional conversion points. Rather than measuring only website visits, signups, and trial-to-paid conversion, this approach measures whether customers have actually reached meaningful value at each stage.

The key insight is that unless customers reach each value milestone, they won't progress to the next one. If you're only measuring end-of-funnel conversions, you can't diagnose where customers are falling off or proactively help them advance. You need to measure the value moments themselves.

This approach also enables both proactive and reactive customer experiences:
- **Proactive**: If you know they reached milestone 1, push them toward milestone 2
- **Reactive**: If you detect they haven't reached milestone 1, catch them and help them get there

## How It Works

For each milestone in your customer journey, define a measurable KPI that indicates the customer has arrived at that value moment:

**Struggle Phase KPIs** (typically straightforward)
| Milestone | What It Means | Typical KPI |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Problem | They're aware you exist | New unique website visitors |
| Interest | They believe you might help | Conversion rate on primary CTA |

**Evaluation Phase KPIs** (requires product analytics)
| Milestone | What It Means | Typical KPI |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| First Value | They've experienced core value once | Specific product activation metric |
| Value Realization | They've solved their job | Threshold of meaningful product usage |

**Growth Phase KPIs** (ongoing engagement)
| Milestone | What It Means | Typical KPI |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Continued Value | They're building a habit | Frequency of key behaviors over time |
| Value Growth | They're expanding or advocating | Upgrades, referrals, or expansion usage |

The key difference from standard metrics:
- **Standard**: Measure conversion rate (10% trial-to-paid)
- **Milestone-Based**: Measure value delivery (60% reached first value, 40% reached full value realization, 25% converted to paid)

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with customer research** — What did customers say was most valuable? What convinced them the product would work? What can they do now they couldn't before?

2. **Map research to product attributes** — Connect customer-stated value to specific features and usage patterns

3. **Define composite metrics** where needed — Often the KPI is a combination:
   - "5+ searches AND created at least 1 list"
   - "Used feature A + feature B within 7 days"

4. **Set up analytics tracking** — Ensure you can measure these specific combinations

5. **Build proactive experiences** — When customers hit milestone N, trigger the experience that guides them to milestone N+1

6. **Build reactive experiences** — When customers *don't* hit a milestone within expected time, trigger re-engagement

7. **Create dashboards showing progress through milestones**, not just end conversions

## Example: SparkToro

| Milestone | KPI | What It Indicates |
|-----------|-----|-------------------|
| Interest | First search performed | They've tried the product |
| First Value | 5+ searches AND 1+ list | They've seen what it can do |
| Value Realization | Searches + lists + first export | They've solved their job |
| Continued Value | Ongoing engagement frequency | They're building a habit |
| Value Growth | Upgrade or team expansion | They're growing with us |

By measuring at each milestone, SparkToro could:
- See where users were falling off (many searched but never created lists)
- Build emails targeting users who hadn't discovered lists
- Add checklists highlighting the path to value
- Result: Trial-to-paid doubled

## When to Use It

- When trial-to-paid or activation metrics are underperforming
- When you can't diagnose *where* in the journey customers fall off
- When building product onboarding or email sequences
- When marketing and product need shared metrics
- When you need to trigger personalized experiences based on customer state

## Common Mistakes

**Too Many Milestones**: Keep to six or fewer—more creates measurement complexity without adding insight

**Too Vague**: "Used the product" isn't measurable. "Performed 5+ searches AND created 1 list" is.

**Missing the Combination**: Value often requires multiple behaviors together, not just one action

**Ignoring Time**: Add time bounds where relevant (within 7 days, within trial period)

**Only Measuring End State**: Measuring trial-to-paid without intermediate milestones gives you no actionable insight
