# Product-Led SEO

> "Think of SEO as a product. The product managers are the people that should be thinking about this SEO question because it's a product question." - Eli Schwartz

## What It Is

Product-Led SEO reframes search engine optimization from a marketing tactic to a product discipline. Instead of treating SEO as "finding keywords, putting them into content, and building links," this framework positions SEO as creating products and experiences for users who discover you through search.

The core insight is that SEO users have a specific journey and intent. They're not coming from social channels or ads—they're doing their own self-discovery. This requires product thinking: understanding the user, designing experiences that serve them, and building assets that convert them.

Traditional SEO asks: "What keywords should we rank for?" Product-Led SEO asks: "What is the search user looking for, and what product can we build to serve them?"

## How It Works

**The Product-Led SEO approach has three core principles:**

1. **SEO is a buyer journey problem**: Search users are at a specific point in their decision-making process. Your SEO needs to meet them where they are and help them progress—not just capture traffic.

2. **SEO requires product resources**: Effective SEO needs design, engineering, product management, and user research—not just content writers and link builders. It's building a product for a specific user segment.

3. **SEO must connect to conversion**: Unlike traditional SEO that celebrates rankings and traffic, Product-Led SEO measures success by whether it drives business outcomes. If traffic doesn't convert, it's worthless.

**The framework in practice:**

- **Product Managers own SEO**, not just marketers. PMs understand user journeys and can build products that serve search users.
- **Engineering resources are required** because SEO often means building programmatic experiences at scale (like Zapier's integration pages or Zillow's property pages).
- **User research drives strategy** by understanding what problems people are actually trying to solve when they search.

## How to Apply It

1. **Understand your search user**: Who is doing searches that could lead to your product? What problem are they trying to solve? What stage of their journey are they in?

2. **Identify the user journey**: Map the path from search to conversion. Are they at the top of the funnel (exploring options) or mid-funnel (evaluating specific solutions)?

3. **Design a product for that user**: Don't just write content—build an experience that serves their need. This might be templates (like Canva), integrations (like Zapier), listings (like Zillow), or tools.

4. **Validate the conversion path**: Ensure there's a clear connection between what the user searches for and what you monetize. If there's no path to conversion, don't invest in that SEO.

5. **Resource it like a product**: Allocate design, engineering, and PM time. Build a PRD. Set milestones and measure against business outcomes, not rankings.

## When to Use It

**Product-Led SEO is most effective when:**

- Your product solves a problem people actively search for
- There's a direct path from search intent to product usage
- You can build programmatic experiences at scale
- Conversion can happen online (not requiring committee decisions)

**It's less effective when:**

- No one searches for your solution (you need brand/awareness channels instead)
- The buyer journey requires sales involvement (enterprise SaaS)
- The search intent doesn't connect to your monetization

## Examples

**Zapier**: People search "Gmail + Salesforce integration" but don't know Zapier exists. Zapier built programmatic pages showing that each integration is possible, creating a discovery path for users who are searching for the solution Zapier provides.

**Tinder**: People in new cities are lonely and search for dating options. Tinder built location-based pages that show up for "online dating in [city]" searches, connecting the loneliness problem to Tinder's solution.

**SurveyMonkey**: People search for "customer satisfaction survey template" and find a template that leads directly into the freemium product. The SEO asset is the product entry point.
