# First 30 Seconds

> "What can you give them in that first 30 seconds that earns you the next 30 seconds and then the next 30 seconds?" - Grant Lee

## What It Is

The First 30 Seconds framework treats the initial moments of product experience as a series of micro-transactions. Each positive moment "earns" the right to keep the user's attention for the next moment. Rather than thinking about onboarding as a long flow, focus obsessively on those first 30 seconds.

Grant Lee describes it through a restaurant analogy: the food might be good, but the entire experience—from walking in the door, getting seated, being greeted, ordering, and paying—determines whether you'd recommend it. The moment someone "walks through your door," what can you give them immediately?

This framework was central to Gamma's transformation. After their Product Hunt launch showed weak organic growth, they spent 3-4 months focusing all 12 team members on making those first 30 seconds magical. The result: growth exploded from hundreds of signups per day to tens of thousands.

## How It Works

The framework operates on several principles:

**1. New users are cynical**
Think of new users as "selfish, vain, and lazy" (a phrase Grant borrowed from Anuj Rathi). They have zero desire to learn a new tool. They don't owe you their time.

**2. Attention must be earned incrementally**
You don't get 10 minutes of goodwill. You get 30 seconds. Deliver value in that window, and you earn the next 30 seconds.

**3. Time to value is everything**
The framework forces you to identify what is the single most magical thing about your product, then surface it immediately.

**4. One idea at a time**
Drawing from consumer advertising: "You throw a consumer one egg, they can probably catch it. You throw them four or five eggs, they're probably going to drop all of them."

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your one egg** - What is the single most compelling thing about your product? For Gamma, it was "create a slide in seconds." Strip away everything else for the initial experience.

2. **Audit your current onboarding** - Watch users go through your product for the first time. Time how long until they experience real value. If it's more than 30 seconds, redesign.

3. **Remove all friction** - Every click, every form field, every decision point in those first 30 seconds should be questioned. Make creation and sharing dead simple.

4. **Make it word-of-mouth worthy** - The first 30 seconds should be so good that someone tells friends. If it's not recommendation-worthy, keep iterating.

5. **Test with strangers** - Your friends will lie to you. Use platforms like UserTesting or Voicepanel to get honest reactions from people with zero skin in the game.

## When to Use It

- **After launch with weak organic growth** - If signups spike then flatten, focus here
- **Before scaling marketing** - Don't invest in acquisition until onboarding is magical
- **When designing new features** - Apply the same principle: can users get value in 30 seconds?
- **Resource-constrained teams** - Even with 12 people, you can rebuild one critical moment

## The Restaurant Test

Ask yourself:
- If someone walked into my "restaurant" right now, would they immediately feel welcomed?
- Would the first thing they experience be delightful?
- Would it be good enough to tell friends about?

If someone just "dropped food on the table and left," they're not coming back.
