# Marketplace Validity Signals

> "The signs that come to mind are one, higher fragmentation... you also want a relatively uniform set of needs... and the last one I'd mention is a high enough barrier in the matchmaking or the creation." - Benjamin Lauzier

## What It Is

Marketplace Validity Signals are three characteristics that indicate whether a marketplace business model is appropriate for a given market. Not every business that connects buyers and sellers should be a marketplace—these signals help founders determine if the marketplace model will create defensible value or if another model would be better.

Many founders are attracted to marketplace dynamics (network effects, capital efficiency) but apply the model to markets where it doesn't fit. This framework provides a quick diagnostic.

## How It Works

### Signal 1: High Fragmentation

**What it means**: A long tail of buyers and sellers without a few big players controlling the market.

**Why it matters**: If a handful of suppliers control the market, they don't need you to aggregate demand—they can do it themselves. If a handful of buyers dominate, they have leverage to go direct.

**Good sign**: Thousands of independent sellers, millions of individual buyers
**Bad sign**: Three airlines, five major retailers, one dominant supplier

### Signal 2: Relatively Uniform Needs

**What it means**: Supply can be somewhat commoditized—what buyers want is predictable and consistent.

**Why it matters**: If every transaction requires completely bespoke matching, the marketplace can't standardize or scale efficiently.

**Good sign**: "I need a ride from A to B" or "I need a place to stay for these dates"
**Bad sign**: Electricians who only want certain jobs, only on certain days, and might cancel for better opportunities (like Thumbtack's challenge)

### Signal 3: High Barrier to Matchmaking

**What it means**: It's hard for buyers and sellers to find each other today, and significant effort is required to vet quality.

**Why it matters**: If matching is easy, why do they need you? Your value comes from reducing friction that currently exists.

**Good sign**: Finding a trustworthy contractor requires calling 10 people and checking references
**Bad sign**: Buyers and sellers already know each other, or finding them is trivially easy

## How to Apply It

Score your market opportunity:

| Signal | Strong (3) | Medium (2) | Weak (1) |
|--------|------------|------------|----------|
| Fragmentation | Thousands of independent suppliers | Some consolidation | Few dominant players |
| Uniform needs | Highly standardized | Some variation | Highly bespoke |
| Matchmaking barrier | Very hard to find/vet | Moderately difficult | Easy to connect |

- **Score 7-9**: Strong marketplace opportunity
- **Score 4-6**: Proceed with caution—marketplace may work with modifications
- **Score 1-3**: Consider alternative business models

## Anti-Patterns: When Marketplace Doesn't Work

- **Cherry (Uber for car washes)**: Unit economics didn't work—customers wouldn't pay what it cost to deliver on-demand car washes
- **Exec (on-demand personal assistants)**: Needs weren't uniform enough, matchmaking wasn't the hard part
- **Sidecar**: Over-fragmented their own marketplace by giving users too many filters

## When to Use It

- **Evaluating startup ideas**: Before committing to a marketplace model
- **Pivoting decisions**: When a marketplace is struggling, check if the model fits
- **Investor conversations**: Articulate why marketplace dynamics will create value
- **Market expansion**: Validate new verticals before launching
