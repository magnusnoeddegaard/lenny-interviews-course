# Demand is the Currency

> "Ultimately demand is the only thing that matters. If you are successful at aggregating the demand in your industry, you will have the winning marketplace. Because if you go to a supplier, a restaurant or an electrician or a driver and say, 'I have this customer for you that I can give to you at a rate that's going to make you money,' they're always going to say yes." - Dan Hockenmaier

## What It Is

In marketplace strategy, there's a common misconception that supply is the key to success. While supply is critically important—especially early on—the ultimate winning factor is aggregating demand. If you control the customers, supply will follow.

This insight reframes how to think about marketplace strategy, competitive positioning, and resource allocation.

## How It Works

### Why Advice Over-Rotates on Supply

Two factors make people think supply is more important than it is:

1. **Early Stage Necessity**: Supply is the product. Without enough supply, you have nothing. This makes it critical early on.

2. **Product Surface Area**: The supply side often has deeper product engagement, requiring more engineering and design resources.

### Why Demand Actually Wins

But these factors can trick you into over-optimizing for supply:

1. **Supply is Responsive**: Give suppliers profitable customers, and they'll say yes. Always.

2. **Demand Creates Leverage**: The marketplace that owns customer relationships controls the market.

3. **Competitive Moats**: Demand aggregation is your defensibility. Supply typically multi-homes until demand concentration forces exclusivity.

### The Nuance: Supply Enables Demand

The relationship is symbiotic:
- You need supply to have anything to offer customers
- But you only acquire supply to improve the customer experience
- Supply acquisition should always be framed through its demand impact

## How to Apply It

1. **Frame Supply Decisions Through Demand**
   - "How does adding this supply improve customer experience?"
   - Not: "How do we get more suppliers?"

2. **Know When Supply Stops Mattering**
   - Beyond a certain point, more supply doesn't improve customer experience
   - Uber doesn't need infinite drivers—just enough for 4-5 minute wait times
   - Amazon doesn't need infinite pet suppliers—just enough for customers to find what they want

3. **Prioritize Customer Perspective**
   - When making trade-offs, ask "What does the customer need?"
   - Build for demand-side delight, even when it means supply-side compromises

4. **Watch for Supply Over-Investment**
   - Are you acquiring supply that doesn't improve customer outcomes?
   - Could those resources better serve demand acquisition or experience?

## When to Use It

- **Resource allocation**: Deciding between supply vs demand investments
- **Strategic planning**: Setting the vision for marketplace growth
- **Competitive analysis**: Understanding what truly creates advantage
- **Product prioritization**: Choosing between supply-side and demand-side features

## Key Insight: The Leverage Equation

> "If you go to a supplier...and say, 'I have this customer for you that I can give to you at a rate that's going to make you money,' they're always going to say yes."

This is the leverage: demand creates an offer supply can't refuse. Supply without demand has no leverage at all.

## Nuance: Supply as Moat

While demand is the currency, differentiated supply can be a powerful acquisition tool. As Lenny notes in the discussion:

> "Usually the reason [you aggregate demand] is [you] acquire supply that is hard to acquire."

So supply can be the *mechanism* for winning demand, even though demand is the *objective*.

## Caution: Timing Matters

This framework applies most clearly once you have basic liquidity. Pre-liquidity, you may need to prioritize supply heavily just to have a viable product. The insight is about optimization priority, not ignoring supply entirely.
