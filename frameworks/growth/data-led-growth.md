# Data-Led Growth (DLG)

> "PLG I always say is actually fundamentally DLG, data led growth. So when you give away your free product, what you want to get in exchange are two things. One is a broader reach because free product spread itself is lower barrier to entry. Two, you want to understand the usage behavior of those free users, which features do they use and which features kind of correlates with a higher conversion rate, retention rate, all of that. If you don't have a foundation of data and understanding of how to analyze those data, you are giving a way of free product for nothing." - Hila Qu

## What It Is

Data-Led Growth (DLG) is the principle that successful product-led growth is fundamentally dependent on having robust data infrastructure and analytics capabilities. Without the ability to track, analyze, and act on user behavior data, offering a free product provides no strategic advantage beyond simple reach.

The core insight is that PLG isn't just about removing friction from the buying process - it's about creating a data feedback loop that helps you understand what drives conversion and retention. When you give away your product for free, you should receive two things in exchange: broader market reach AND deep behavioral insights about your users.

Many companies fail at PLG because they launch a free version without the data foundation to learn from it. They end up giving away their product without gaining the strategic intelligence that makes PLG powerful.

## How It Works

The DLG framework has two essential components:

**1. Broader Reach**
- Free products spread naturally due to lower barrier to entry
- Users can try before they buy, expanding your addressable market
- Word of mouth and viral loops become possible

**2. Usage Behavior Intelligence**
- Track which features users engage with
- Identify correlations between behavior and conversion
- Understand patterns that predict retention
- Map the customer journey from signup to value realization

**Data Foundation Requirements:**
- Product analytics tool (Amplitude, Mixpanel, PostHog)
- Data hub/collection layer (Segment)
- Data dictionary documenting key events and definitions
- Customer 360 database connecting product data with CRM/marketing data

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your data instrumentation** - Before launching PLG, review your current tracking. Identify gaps between key user actions and what you actually measure.

2. **Create a data dictionary** - Document all key actions, event names, and properties. Ensure consistent definitions across teams.

3. **Track the right events** - Focus on high-value actions that correlate with conversion and retention, not vanity metrics.

4. **Connect data sources** - Build a Customer 360 view that combines product usage with marketing campaigns, CRM data, and firmographic information.

5. **Analyze before experimenting** - Use data to identify leverage points before running experiments. Understand which behaviors predict success.

6. **Close the feedback loop** - Ensure learnings from data flow back into product decisions, marketing campaigns, and sales conversations.

## When to Use It

- When evaluating whether to add a PLG motion to your business
- When diagnosing why your free trial isn't converting
- When deciding what data infrastructure to invest in
- When your PLG motion has stalled and you need to find optimization opportunities
- When building the business case for analytics investment
