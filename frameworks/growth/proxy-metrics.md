# Proxy Metrics for Long-Term Outcomes

> "Retention is a terrible thing to goal on. It's almost impossible to drive in a meaningful way in a short term. Ultimately, you want to find a short-term metric you can measure that drives a long-term output." - Jessica Lachs

## What It Is

A metric selection approach that recognizes that many important business outcomes (like retention, lifetime value, or long-term engagement) take too long to measure for rapid iteration. Instead of goaling teams on these lagging indicators directly, you identify shorter-term "proxy" metrics that are both measurable quickly and proven to drive the long-term outcomes you care about.

The key insight is that teams need to be able to experiment and iterate quickly. If you can only measure success in 6-12 months, you can't learn fast enough to win.

## How It Works

**The Problem with Long-Term Metrics:**
- Retention, LTV, and engagement take months or years to measure accurately
- You can't run quick experiments when feedback loops are that long
- Teams get demoralized when they can't see impact
- By the time you know if something worked, you've moved on

**The Solution:**
1. Identify your most important long-term outcomes (retention, LTV, engagement)
2. Find the short-term behaviors and actions that predict those outcomes
3. Validate through experimentation that improving the proxy actually drives the long-term metric
4. Goal teams on the proxy metrics, not the lagging indicators

**Examples of Proxy Metrics:**
- Instead of "90-day retention" → "7-day activation rate" or "number of orders in first week"
- Instead of "lifetime value" → "engagement depth in first 30 days"
- Instead of "churn reduction" → "feature adoption rate" or "support ticket volume"

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your lagging indicators**: What long-term metrics matter most? (Retention, LTV, engagement, etc.)

2. **Analyze what predicts success**: Look at your best customers/users. What did they do early that others didn't? What behaviors in week 1 predict retention at month 6?

3. **Establish correlation**: Use data analysis to validate the relationship between potential proxy metrics and long-term outcomes

4. **Test causation**: Run experiments where you deliberately try to move the proxy metric and measure if it impacts the long-term outcome

5. **Set goals on proxies**: Once validated, goal your teams on the proxy metrics they can actually move quickly

6. **Keep validating**: Periodically check that your proxy metrics still predict the long-term outcomes as your product and market evolve

## When to Use It

- When teams are goaled on retention but can't measure impact for months
- When experimentation velocity is limited by slow feedback loops
- When you're trying to grow engagement or reduce churn
- When building goal frameworks for product, growth, or marketing teams
- When your current metrics aren't actionable enough
