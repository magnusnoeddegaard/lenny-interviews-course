# Citation Optimization Strategy

> "The LLM is summarizing many citations, and so you need to get mentioned as many times as possible. Usually when you ask something like 'What's the best tool for X?' The first answer will be mentioned the most in the citations." - Ethan Smith

## What It Is

Citation Optimization is the offsite component of Answer Engine Optimization (AEO). Unlike traditional SEO where ranking #1 wins, LLMs summarize multiple sources—the product mentioned most frequently across citations typically becomes the top recommendation.

This creates a fundamentally different competitive dynamic: early-stage companies without domain authority can win immediately by getting mentioned in Reddit threads, YouTube videos, and blogs that LLMs cite.

## How It Works

LLMs use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to answer questions. They search for relevant content, identify citations, and summarize them. Different sources carry different weight and appear with different frequency depending on the query type.

**Citation Source Categories**:

| Source Type | Examples | Controllability | Cost |
|------------|----------|-----------------|------|
| Your Site | Landing pages, blog | High | Low |
| Video | YouTube, Vimeo | High | Medium |
| UGC | Reddit, Quora | Medium | Low |
| Tier-1 Affiliates | Dotdash Meredith, Forbes | High (if you pay) | High |
| Tier-2 Affiliates | TechRadar, niche blogs | Medium | Medium |
| Earned Media | News, reviews | Low | Variable |

**Key Insight**: Citation overlap between platforms varies. ChatGPT and Google Search have only ~35% citation overlap. Perplexity has ~70% overlap with Google. Each platform needs separate tracking.

## How to Apply It

### Video Strategy (YouTube/Vimeo)
- High controllability—no community moderation
- Underutilized for B2B ("There's not that many videos about AI-powered payment processing APIs")
- Create videos for high-LTV keywords with little video competition
- Vimeo also gets indexed, not just YouTube

### Reddit Strategy
- Most cited UGC source
- **Spam doesn't work**: Fake accounts, auto-posting, and self-liking get banned
- **What works**: Real accounts, real names, state where you work, give genuinely useful answers
- Target threads that appear in citations for your target questions
- You don't need 10,000 comments—even 5 quality comments can drive results

### Affiliate Strategy
- Most controllable but expensive
- Dotdash Meredith (Good Housekeeping, Allrecipes, Investopedia) is heavily cited
- Forbes Advisor, TechRadar appear frequently for B2B
- Pay to be included in "best of" lists

### Earned Coverage
- Less controllable but valuable
- Blogs, reviews, news mentions
- Compounds with brand building

## Different Citation Profiles by Category

**B2B SaaS**:
- TechRadar, G2, Capterra prominent
- Help centers get cited for specific feature questions
- YouTube underutilized opportunity

**Commerce**:
- Dotdash Meredith brands (Glamour, Good Housekeeping)
- Rich snippets and schema matter
- Shopping carousels are clickable

**Local/Marketplaces**:
- Yelp, TripAdvisor, Eater
- Maps integration important
- Local review sites

## When to Use It

- When you want to show up in LLM answers quickly (works faster than SEO)
- When you're an early-stage company without domain authority
- When competitors haven't optimized their citation presence
- When your target questions have limited video coverage

**Early-stage recommendation**: Focus on citation optimization and long-tail questions. Skip traditional SEO until Series A/B.
