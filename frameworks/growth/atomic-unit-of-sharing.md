# Atomic Unit of Sharing

> "I think that community lends itself particularly well if you have something that your product creates that people want to share because it exhibits something about themselves... showing people what it is that you've created is an aspirational thing to do." - Camille Ricketts

## What It Is

The Atomic Unit of Sharing is the core shareable artifact that your product enables users to create. When users share these artifacts, they simultaneously express their identity and organically market your product.

Products with strong atomic units of sharing are "creative products"—they help users build things they're proud to show off. The sharing becomes aspirational because it demonstrates:
- Mastery of the tool
- Personal organization or creativity
- Self-expression and identity

This creates a natural flywheel: users create → share → others discover → new users create.

## How It Works

The atomic unit must satisfy three criteria to drive community growth:

**1. Exhibits Something About the Creator**
The shared artifact must reflect positively on the person sharing it. People share things that make them look:
- Competent (shows they're skilled)
- Organized (shows they have their life together)
- Creative (shows unique thinking)

**2. Has Standalone Value**
The artifact must be valuable or interesting to viewers independent of the product. Templates, designs, and portfolios work because they're useful or beautiful on their own.

**3. Is Easy to Share**
The technical and social barriers to sharing must be low. The sharing mechanism should be native to how people already communicate.

## Examples

| Product | Atomic Unit | Why It Works |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Notion | Templates, workspaces | Shows organization and creativity |
| Figma | Design files | Shows design skill and thinking |
| Canva | Graphics and presentations | Shows creativity without design skills |

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your atomic unit** - What artifact does your product naturally create that users might want to share?

2. **Assess aspirational value** - Does sharing this make users look good? Does it express their identity?

3. **Reduce friction** - Make sharing as easy as possible. Export options, public links, embeds, and social integrations all help.

4. **Celebrate sharers** - Feature community creations, run showcase events, and build galleries of user work.

5. **Enable monetization** - If possible, let power users sell their atomic units (templates, designs) to compound the incentive to share.

## When to Use It

- When evaluating if your product is suited for community-led growth
- When deciding what features to build to increase organic sharing
- When designing your product's output format
- When considering community investment priorities

## Signs Your Product Has a Strong Atomic Unit

- Users already share creations without prompting
- Screenshots of your product appear on social media
- Users build personal brands around creating with your tool
- There's an emerging ecosystem of templates or resources
