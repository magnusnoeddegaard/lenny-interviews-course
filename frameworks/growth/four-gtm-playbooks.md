# Four Go-to-Market Playbooks

> "Each one of these things, the market dynamics call for a very clear response. It's not hard to see the response. What people struggle with is, 'I have been successful with this playbook, the market has moved to the next phase, but I'm really good at the old playbook, so I want to stay with the playbook I'm good at.' So that's when they get in trouble." - Geoffrey Moore

## What It Is

Four distinct go-to-market strategies aligned to four stages of the technology adoption lifecycle. Each playbook has different sales motions, pricing models, customer expectations, and success metrics. The critical insight: these playbooks don't work together. Using the wrong one for your stage will actively hurt you.

The four playbooks correspond to four customer motivations:
1. **Early Market**: "We believe what you believe"
2. **Bowling Alley**: "We need what you have"
3. **Tornado**: "We want what they have"
4. **Main Street**: "We don't want to own the product"

## How It Works

### Playbook 1: Early Market (Project Model)

**Customer**: Visionaries and technology enthusiasts
**Customer motivation**: "We believe what you believe"
**Business model**: Projects

**Characteristics**:
- Customers are as excited about your vision as you are
- They want demos, they want to see the technology
- No established budget for your category
- Every deal is a snowflake—highly customized
- Requires an executive sponsor with clout to create funding
- Lots of extra labor to make each customer successful

**Sales approach**:
- Lead with vision and technology demo
- Find visionary executive sponsors who want to leapfrog competitors
- Tell your story—they want to hear about you
- Accept that it's not scalable

**Success metric**: Marquee customers that put you on the map

### Playbook 2: Bowling Alley (Solution Model)

**Customer**: Early pragmatists with severe problems
**Customer motivation**: "We need what you have"
**Business model**: Solutions (repeatable whole products)

**Characteristics**:
- Customers are open to talking to someone new because their problem isn't solved
- Budget exists but it's allocated to something else—you must redirect it
- They don't want to hear about you; they want to talk about their problem
- Over-commit to solving their specific problem
- Build ecosystem partnerships to deliver complete solutions

**Sales approach**:
- "Shut the laptop. Don't open it."
- Start with: "We've been working with people in your industry. There's a serious problem around X. Do you have it?"
- Ask probing questions like a doctor diagnosing a patient
- Take notes visibly—show you're listening
- Never give a demo until you've diagnosed the problem

**Success metric**: Reference customers in a specific segment who will talk to their peers

### Playbook 3: Tornado (Product Model)

**Customer**: Mainstream pragmatists following the herd
**Customer motivation**: "We want what they have"
**Business model**: Standard products

**Characteristics**:
- Budgets now have your category's name on them
- The herd has decided this category matters
- Speed matters—whoever captures the most market share early wins
- Ecosystems form around market leaders
- Competitive, land-grab dynamics

**Sales approach**:
- Sales coverage—go broad
- Standard product, minimize customization
- Lead with "we're the market leader"
- Competitive win rate is the game
- Trade market share for revenue if necessary

**How to know you're in the tornado**: Customers have budget explicitly for your category. In the bowling alley, budget exists but must be redirected. In the tornado, they call you.

**Success metric**: Market share percentage

### Playbook 4: Main Street (Service Model)

**Customer**: Late majority, established customers
**Customer motivation**: "We don't want to own the product"
**Business model**: Services, subscriptions, expand

**Characteristics**:
- Products are commoditized—services become the innovation layer
- "Land and expand" dynamics
- Customer expects convenience over ownership
- Innovation happens in how you deliver, not what you deliver

**Sales approach**:
- Focus on expansion and retention
- Service differentiation
- Operational excellence
- Product-led growth works well here (low risk, easy expansion)

**Example**: "We've had taxis for 100 years, but Uber is an incredibly valuable thing."

**Success metric**: Net revenue retention, expansion

## Why Playbooks Don't Mix

**Early Market playbook in Bowling Alley**:
- Problem: Projects don't scale; ecosystem won't form around you
- Visionaries will pull you off your solution roadmap
- You win deals but can't build repeatable business

**Bowling Alley playbook in Early Market**:
- Problem: Over-investing in one solution when visionaries want breadth
- The visionary doesn't want your packaged solution—they want your magic ingredient

**Tornado playbook in Bowling Alley**:
- Problem: "Qualify on budget before calling" kills you because there's no budget yet
- Sales team gives up on customers who are actually ideal targets
- You need salespeople who can redirect budget, not find existing budget

**Bowling Alley playbook in Tornado**:
- Problem: Too slow, too customized
- Competitors capture market share while you over-invest in each deal
- You win the battle but lose the war

## Transitions Between Playbooks

The hardest moments are transitions. Signs you need to switch:

**Early Market → Bowling Alley**:
- You have your marquee customer
- Your product is stable enough for pragmatists
- You can't scale on project-by-project basis

**Bowling Alley → Tornado**:
- Customers start having budget for your category
- The press writes about your category, not just your company
- "Wi-Fi isn't just for financial analysts—it's for everybody"

**Tornado → Main Street**:
- Market share is mostly captured
- Innovation shifts from products to services
- "Land and expand" becomes the growth lever

## How to Apply It

1. **Diagnose your stage** - Where are your customers on the adoption lifecycle? Do they have budget for you?

2. **Match your playbook** - Use the sales motion, pricing model, and success metrics appropriate to your stage

3. **Watch for transitions** - When your playbook stops working, it might mean the market moved—not that you got worse

4. **Don't fight the transition** - "I'm really good at the old playbook" is how companies get stuck

5. **Hire for your stage** - Enterprise salespeople are wrong for the bowling alley; solution-focused sales engineers are wrong for the tornado
