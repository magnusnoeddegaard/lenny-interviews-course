# Quality is Growth

> "I know there's this saying of it's growth versus quality, but quality is growth. And if you think about how you can make your product easier to use and more understandable, that will of course drive people to use it, and use more of it, and have a better experience with it that they'll want to talk about with others." - Katie Dill

## What It Is

"Quality versus Growth" is a false dichotomy. Quality improvements ARE growth drivers. When you make products easier to use, more understandable, and more delightful, you directly impact business metrics: activation rates, retention, referrals, and revenue.

The belief that quality doesn't move metrics is dangerous because it becomes an excuse to ship mediocre products. Katie Dill argues this belief is factually wrong—Stripe has seen direct business impact from quality improvements, including a 10.5% increase in business revenue from improving the checkout experience.

The key insight is to stop treating quality as a cost center and start treating it as a growth lever.

## How It Works

**Quality drives activation:**
Making products easier to understand and use increases the percentage of people who successfully onboard. Stripe saw activations increase by improving onboarding flows to help users understand products better.

**Quality reduces support costs:**
Every support call is often a quality issue. When users can't find what they need or don't understand what to do, they call support. Improving clarity eliminates this friction.

**Quality increases conversion:**
Stripe found that 99% of top e-commerce sites have errors in checkout that hinder conversion. By obsessing over checkout quality, they've driven a 10.5% revenue increase for businesses.

**Quality drives word of mouth:**
Products that exceed expectations get talked about. When people have a better experience, they share it with others.

## How to Apply It

1. **Document quality-to-metric wins** - Every company has examples of quality improvements that moved metrics. Find these stories, share them widely, and make them part of your culture.

2. **Measure quality impact** - Don't accept that quality can't be measured. Track support tickets, activation rates, time-to-complete, and user satisfaction against quality changes.

3. **Frame quality work as growth work** - When pitching quality improvements, lead with the business metric you expect to move, not just the UX improvement.

4. **Challenge the false dichotomy** - When someone says "should we do quality or growth," reframe the question. The answer is often "quality drives growth."

5. **Look for quality-driven opportunities** - Analyze support tickets, user feedback, and drop-off points. These often reveal quality issues with clear business impact.

## When to Use It

- When advocating for resources for quality improvements
- When planning roadmaps and someone frames quality as optional
- When measuring the impact of design and UX work
- When making the business case for investing in craft
- When debating feature work vs. polish work
