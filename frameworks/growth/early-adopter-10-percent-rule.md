# Early Adopter 10% Rule

> "If you take the average customer group in the world, 90% are not early adopters. It doesn't matter if you have something new and cool, they're just not interested... Those 10 percents are the early adopters. They're the ones that you actually want to reach. But that means you have to reach 10 to find one." - Gustaf Alstromer

## What It Is

The Early Adopter 10% Rule is Gustaf Alstromer's quantification of the adoption curve reality: only about 10% of any potential customer base are early adopters willing to try new, unproven products. The other 90% are not incentivized to take risks in their job to try something new.

This simple math transforms how founders should think about customer acquisition. If you need to talk to 50 potential customers, you need to reach out to 500. Understanding this prevents discouragement when most people say no.

## How It Works

### Why 90% Will Say No

The majority of people in any market:
- Are not incentivized to take risks at work
- Are rewarded for maintaining the status quo
- Don't have the time or energy for experiments
- Are comfortable with their current solution (even if imperfect)

### Why 10% Will Say Yes

Early adopters:
- Are curious about new technology and approaches
- Have personal motivation to be on the cutting edge
- Are willing to tolerate imperfection for potential upside
- Often have specific, acute pain that makes them desperate for solutions

### The Rejection Math

If you need:
- **5 paying customers** → reach out to **500 people**
- **10 design partners** → reach out to **1,000 people**
- **50 user interviews** → reach out to **5,000 people**

This math is "common knowledge, basic stuff for salespeople, but founders should never done sales before just get surprised by the percentages."

## How to Apply It

### Reset Expectations

Before starting outreach:
1. Calculate how many customers you need
2. Multiply by 10 to get your required outreach volume
3. Build systems to handle that volume (tools, templates, tracking)
4. Set mental expectations for 90% rejection

### Qualify for Early Adopter Signals

When you find someone willing to talk:
- They're likely an early adopter
- Invest extra time with them
- These conversations convert to customers
- "You are already doing most of the sales by just doing this work anyway"

### Watch, Don't Just Ask

Gustaf emphasizes that discovering pain requires observation:

"The best way for you to figure out what is the intensity of the problem is not to ask them but to watch them... have them screen share, have them walk you through their daily workflow."

People often don't know their problems are problems. You have to see the inefficiency to understand its magnitude.

### The Screen Share Test

For discovering real pain:
1. Get on a call with a potential customer
2. Ask them to share their screen
3. Have them walk through their daily workflow in your problem area
4. Watch for friction they've normalized

"You can't actually ask them how difficult is it to do X, Y, Z because they won't even know that it's that difficult to them."

## When to Use It

- **When planning outbound** - Size your pipeline appropriately
- **When feeling rejected** - Remember this is expected math
- **When qualifying leads** - Focus energy on the 10%
- **When user research planning** - Account for response rates

## The Counterintuitive Insight

Narrow solutions have an even smaller early adopter pool, but that's okay:

"The more narrow of a solution you have to a specific problem, the fewer people actually want to dig in. But that's where you have to start because you cannot build the whole thing right up front and make everybody loves you."

Starting narrow means your 10% is an even smaller absolute number - but they're also more likely to pay and become evangelists.
