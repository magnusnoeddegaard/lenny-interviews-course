# Value Creation Over Capture

> "At dbt Labs we have this value—it's one of our core values—that says we are more concerned with value creation than value capture. When we talk about what is the value of dbt Labs to our customers, they often talk about how it's 20 to 35% as valuable as what they spend on their cloud data warehouse. But what we charge our customers is a very small fraction of that 20 to 35% and that's by design." - Julia Schottenstein

## What It Is

Value Creation Over Capture is a strategic philosophy and company value that prioritizes generating customer value over maximizing short-term revenue extraction. It means deliberately leaving money on the table to build long-term trust, adoption, and ecosystem growth.

This isn't charity—it's a deliberate business strategy. By capturing only a fraction of the value you create, you accelerate adoption, build goodwill, and create durable competitive advantages.

## How It Works

### The Math

**Customer perception**: dbt is worth 20-35% of their data warehouse spend
**What dbt charges**: A "very small fraction" of that perceived value

**Example**:
- Company spends $100K on Snowflake
- They perceive dbt as worth $20-35K (20-35% of warehouse spend)
- dbt charges $5-10K
- Customer surplus: $10-25K of value they don't pay for

### Why This Works

#### 1. Accelerates Adoption

Low prices relative to value = easy buying decision:
- No need for extensive justification
- Fast procurement cycles
- Higher conversion rates
- Lower churn (value exceeds cost)

#### 2. Builds Trust and Goodwill

> "We really mean this... we try to put a lot of good out into the world and it pays back slowly."

Customers recognize when they're getting a good deal. This creates:
- Loyalty that survives competitive pressure
- Organic advocacy and referrals
- Goodwill during inevitable product issues
- Community engagement

#### 3. Creates Network Effects

More customers = stronger ecosystem:
- More partners build integrations
- More community knowledge
- More hiring pool of skilled users
- More feedback for product improvement

#### 4. Makes Competition Difficult

When you capture only a fraction of value:
- Competitors can't win on price (you're already cheap)
- Competitors must create even MORE value
- The ecosystem lock-in is already strong

### The Long-Term Payoff

> "It pays back slowly."

This strategy trades short-term revenue for:
- Larger eventual market share
- Stronger competitive moat
- Higher lifetime customer value
- Sustainable growth trajectory

## How to Apply It

### Step 1: Quantify the Value You Create

Understand what your product is worth to customers:
- What problem does it solve?
- What's the cost of the alternative?
- What's the ROI of using your product?

dbt example: "20-35% as valuable as cloud data warehouse spend"

### Step 2: Price Below That Value (Deliberately)

Set prices that leave significant surplus for customers:
- Easy to justify internally
- Fast to approve
- Obviously good value

### Step 3: Communicate the Philosophy

Make it explicit that this is intentional:
- Include in company values
- Explain to customers
- Reinforce in pricing decisions

### Step 4: Trust the Long Game

This requires patience and conviction:
- You will leave money on the table
- You will be "underpriced" vs. what you could charge
- The payoff compounds over time

## When to Use It

- **Platform businesses**: Network effects multiply value creation
- **Open source/ecosystem plays**: Adoption is the priority
- **Long sales cycles**: Trust matters more than extraction
- **When building a standard**: Adoption velocity matters
- **When you can afford it**: Requires sufficient runway

## When to Be Careful

- **Running out of runway**: Can't create value if you're dead
- **No network effects**: Some businesses are better served by capturing more
- **Commoditized markets**: Price signals quality; too cheap can hurt
- **Already at scale**: May make sense to capture more once dominant

## The Cultural Element

This only works if it's genuine:

> "We really mean this."

If it's just marketing while you maximize extraction, customers will notice. The philosophy must be lived:
- Product decisions favor customer value
- Pricing decisions aren't pure optimization
- Team is selected for alignment with values
- Leadership models the behavior

## Companion Principle: Happy to Lose to Ourselves

Julia describes a related pricing philosophy:

> "When we lose a deal we most often lose it to dbt open source and we like it that way. We're happy to lose to ourselves."

This is value creation over capture taken to its logical conclusion: you provide enough free value that some customers never pay—and that's okay.
