# Bottom-Up GTM Motion

> "You have this core audience... they love you so much that they're willing to put their social capital and themselves on the line and spread the product throughout whatever their communities are." - Claire Butler

## What It Is

A go-to-market strategy that focuses on winning individual contributors (ICs) first, then leveraging their enthusiasm to spread adoption throughout their organizations. This is the opposite of traditional top-down enterprise sales where you convince executives first.

The motion has two distinct phases: (1) get ICs to love your product through credibility, quality, and relationship-building, and (2) enable those ICs to become internal champions who spread the product within their companies.

Figma operated without a sales team for their first three years using this approach. All revenue came from self-serve, with users paying on credit cards. When they did add sales, most leads came from existing free or pro users wanting to upgrade their entire company.

## How It Works

### Part 1: Get ICs to Love You

**1. Build Credibility**
- Create technical content written by practitioners, not marketers
- Hire "Designer Advocates" (or equivalent) from your user base
- Don't market to technical audiences—educate them
- Content should be technical enough that non-experts can't write it

**2. Build With Your Users**
- Do things that don't scale: fix individual user problems personally
- Use direct support channels (Intercom, etc.) where engineers can debug live with users
- Make users feel ownership: "I asked for this feature, they built it"

**3. Go Where They Already Are**
- Find existing communities (Twitter, forums, etc.) rather than building your own
- Build relationship over time through passive following before conversion
- Enable users to track your progress without committing to the tool

**4. Be Transparent and Authentic**
- Don't hide behind the brand handle
- Do public postmortems when things go wrong
- Hold open Q&As during controversial moments

### Part 2: Enable Organizational Spread

**1. Make It Easy to Try and Share**
- Robust free tier that allows real usage over time
- Optimize for collaboration: unlimited collaborators > unlimited files
- Don't introduce payment gates too early
- Free viewers/commenters to expand touchpoints across the org

**2. Embed Advocates in Sales (The Tom Factor)**
- Technical experts who join sales calls to build credibility with buyers
- Never have quotas—their job is helping, not selling
- They translate between what the product does and what the buyer needs

**3. Turn Your Biggest Blocker Into Your Biggest Driver**
- Identify what prevents organizational adoption (for Figma: design systems)
- Build features, content, and community around that blocker
- Make the thing that kept people away become the reason they upgrade

**4. Nurture Internal Champions**
- Help champions grow their careers (speaking opportunities, social amplification)
- Maintain relationships even when they're frustrated
- They become your evangelists for future expansion

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your IC audience** - Who uses the product daily? What do they care about deeply?

2. **Audit your credibility** - Are you creating content a marketer could write, or content that only practitioners would create?

3. **Map your distribution** - Where does your target audience already congregate? Go there instead of building your own community.

4. **Design your free tier for spread** - What gates collaboration vs. what gates individual power features? Optimize for the former.

5. **Identify your "design systems"** - What's the biggest blocker preventing organizational adoption? Can you own that problem?

6. **Hire from your user base** - Your best advocates come from passionate users, not job postings.

## When to Use It

Best suited for:
- Technical products used by practitioners (designers, engineers, data scientists)
- Tools where ICs have strong opinions about what they use
- Products with natural collaboration touch points
- Audiences with existing communities and opinion leaders
- Products where the IC user and the enterprise buyer are different people

Less suited for:
- Products where executives are the primary users
- Tools that require organizational buy-in to provide value
- Markets without existing practitioner communities
