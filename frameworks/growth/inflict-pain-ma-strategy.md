# Inflict Pain M&A Strategy

> "M&A is always about creating plan Bs. For any one company, there's only ever two to three buyers that find what you're building to be extremely strategic. The strategy I would do is figure out the area that you bring a competitive advantage and inflict pain on that potential buyer. Make it impossible for them to not notice you." - Julia Schottenstein

## What It Is

The Inflict Pain M&A Strategy is an approach to positioning your startup for acquisition by making competitive impact on potential buyers—forcing them to notice you—while maintaining a collaborative, friendly relationship. It's about creating strategic leverage without burning bridges.

The core insight is that most startups have only 2-3 potential acquirers who would find their offering truly strategic. Rather than waiting passively for acquisition interest, you actively demonstrate your competitive threat in exactly the area where you could help them.

## How It Works

### The Paradox: Compete and Collaborate

The key tension is that you must:
1. **Inflict enough pain** that potential buyers can't ignore you
2. **Stay friendly and open** so the acquisition door remains open

> "The really important piece is you want to do that in a way that's still friendly and open. I see a lot of founders get this wrong and they prematurely shut down a conversation or take too competitive of a stance. But that's a mistake because M&A is all about creating plan Bs."

### Transform's Playbook (Real Example)

Julia describes how Transform (which dbt Labs acquired) executed this perfectly:

1. **Identified their advantage**: Transform had superior technology for the semantic/metrics layer from their Airbnb Minerva experience
2. **Applied competitive pressure**: They were "vocal and loud" about how their solution solved hard technical problems that dbt was still working on
3. **Stayed positioned as partners**: They framed themselves as complementary to dbt's ecosystem, not adversarial
4. **Made integration easy**: By positioning as partners, they'd already done work to integrate with dbt

The result: When acquisition time came, dbt knew Transform's product was good and the integration would be smooth.

### Why It Works

- **Creates urgency**: Pain makes your area of focus top-of-mind for the buyer
- **Demonstrates value**: You're proving your competitive advantage in real-time
- **Preserves optionality**: Friendly positioning keeps the acquisition door open
- **Validates your worth**: If you're genuinely causing pain, your technology has value

## How to Apply It

### Step 1: Identify Your Buyer Set

> "There's only ever two to three buyers that find what you're building to be extremely strategic."

Start with ~12 potential buyers, then narrow to 2-3 where:
- Your product addresses their strategic gap
- Your technology would accelerate their roadmap
- Acquisition makes financial sense for both parties

### Step 2: Find Your Competitive Wedge

Identify the specific area where you outperform or threaten them:
- A technical problem you've solved that they haven't
- A market segment you're winning
- A capability they need for their roadmap

### Step 3: Be Loud About Your Wins

Make it "impossible for them to not notice you":
- Publish content about your technical achievements
- Win customers in their target market
- Build community buzz around your solution
- Position yourself as the emerging standard

### Step 4: Stay Friendly and Open

While competing, maintain relationships:
- Position as a partner or complementary player
- Take meetings with their corp dev team
- Find integration or collaboration opportunities
- Don't publicly trash them or burn bridges

### Step 5: Build Integration Readiness

If you position as a partner, do the work:
- Build integrations with their platform
- Make your technology easy to fold into theirs
- Reduce post-acquisition complexity

## When to Use It

- **When you have runway**: You're not desperate, so you can play the long game
- **When your tech is genuinely strong**: You need real competitive pressure, not theater
- **When you've identified strategic buyers**: Random companies won't care about your "pain"
- **When building toward exit optionality**: Even if you want to stay independent, M&A should be a viable plan B

## When NOT to Use It

- **When you're desperate**: Hail Mary situations require transparency, not positioning
- **When bridges are already burned**: Too late for the friendly approach
- **When you're bluffing**: If you can't actually inflict pain, this backfires

## Common Mistakes

1. **Being too aggressive**: Shutting down conversations or taking hostile stances
2. **Being too passive**: Not making enough competitive impact to get noticed
3. **Wrong buyer set**: Trying to inflict pain on companies who don't care about your space
4. **Misaligned messaging**: Being adversarial publicly while trying to be friendly privately
