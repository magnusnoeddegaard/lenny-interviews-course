# Marquee Customer Strategy

> "Do you have a technology expert who's a wizard? Can you demo the technology? Can you create a vision which says what forces are going to release? And can you get one or more customers who put you on the map? 'Whoa, did you know that the CIA used AWS?' Holy smoke. That doesn't make a company, but it makes a story." - Geoffrey Moore

## What It Is

A marquee customer (also called a lighthouse customer or radiating reference) is a high-profile early adopter that gives your startup credibility and visibility before you attempt to cross the chasm. This is not your beachhead customer—it's the prerequisite to selecting your beachhead.

The marquee customer strategy recognizes that you need to make yourself visible before pragmatists will take you seriously. You need a famous name that people have heard of, doing something impressive with your technology, so you can say "we're the guys who did the X project."

## How It Works

### What a Marquee Customer Provides

1. **Visibility** - You need people to have heard of your customer: "If they've never heard of your customer, I don't care how amazing the win is. Nobody's going to hear about it."

2. **Credibility** - The marquee customer is making a bet on your technology that others will respect

3. **A Story** - "That's your claim to fame. You did the Kessel Run in 15 parsecs."

4. **Proof the Technology Works** - The marquee project demonstrates your 10x capability

### Why Visionaries Make Good Marquee Customers

The best marquee customers are visionaries because:

- They make their own decisions (don't need peer references)
- They want to be different from competitors
- They have executive sponsorship with budget authority
- They're willing to take risk on unproven technology
- They have fairly big egos and tend to like to talk

The ideal visionary executive sponsor says: "I'm so tired of the status quo. I like talking to you better than I like talking to my peers because you're different and I want to be different. I want to leapfrog the world."

### The 10x Effect

Your technology needs to demonstrate something an order of magnitude better than anything else. Andy Grove called this the "10x effect":

- Not incrementally better—dramatically better
- Something nobody else can do
- The magic ingredient that justifies the risk

"You have to have the magic ingredient working. You don't have the whole product. And in fact, your product may be buggy, but it does something... an order of magnitude better than anything."

## How to Apply It

**1. Identify Potential Visionaries**

Look for the one-in-ten executive who:
- Is frustrated with the status quo
- Wants to leapfrog competitors
- Has the clout to create budget (there's no budget for you)
- Can drive their organization to "go all the way to bright"

Avoid the nine-in-ten company people who will send you to purchasing.

**2. Pursue Famous Companies**

Target companies whose names people recognize:
- Apple, Mercedes, Verizon, the CIA
- Industry leaders in any sector
- Companies the press writes about

The brand matters as much as the project.

**3. Accept Project Mode**

Early market success is not scalable:
- Every customer is a snowflake
- Heavy customization required
- Throw extra labor at making them successful
- "You do whatever it takes, because you got to make them successful"

Don't expect repeatable business yet.

**4. Get Them Talking**

"The good news about visionaries is they tend to have fairly big egos and they tend to like to talk." Unlike pragmatists who need legal approval, visionaries want to share their success.

### Why Marquee ≠ Beachhead

Your marquee customer probably won't be in your beachhead segment:

1. **Visionaries did weird things** - Their implementation won't be replicable
2. **They don't want to help competitors** - "The whole point was they wanted to get ahead of their competitors. They didn't want to help."
3. **Pragmatists don't trust visionaries** - Visionary references don't work for pragmatist buyers

"Normally you can't use the visionary project as your beachhead. You'd love to from a point of view of reusing the work. You just can't."

### The Radiating Reference

A great marquee customer becomes a "radiating reference"—they talk about you when you're not in the room. This is the gold standard: unsolicited word-of-mouth from a company everyone has heard of.

## When You're Ready to Move On

You know you're ready to leave the early market and attempt crossing the chasm when:
- You have at least one marquee customer
- Your technology is stable enough for pragmatists
- You can articulate a clear beachhead segment
- You have a hunch about which segment to target

"Before you try to cross the chasm, do you have a marquee? Have you won a marquee customer that puts you on the map?"

## Example: Figma

Figma's early work with Coda (then called Krypton) demonstrates marquee customer intensity:

- Dylan Field and team went to the office to set them up
- When something broke, they drove hours back to fix it (turned out to be a WiFi issue)
- They fixed "ridiculous bugs that were not important" to ensure customer success
- Complete obsession with making one customer love the product

"You need to find one company that just loves you. It's not like 'this is cool.' It's like, 'I love this product. I would never want to give it up.'"
