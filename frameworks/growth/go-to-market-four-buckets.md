# Go-to-Market Four Buckets

> "Our founders, even the most capable of them, find this topic pretty overwhelming because it branches into so many areas. So we do try and distill it to something that is in bite-sized chunks." - Jonathan Lowenhar

## What It Is

Go-to-market strategy overwhelms most founders because it branches into so many areas: positioning, marketing, channels, sales, pricing, and more. Jonathan Lowenhar's Four Buckets framework distills this complexity into four sequential questions that must be answered to build a repeatable GTM motion.

The biggest mistake founders make is skipping bucket #1 (Ideal Customer Profile) and jumping straight to selling. Early-stage founders are "like twenty-something year olds in a bar"—anyone who makes eye contact is enough to go on a date. This lack of discrimination is the most expensive GTM mistake because everything downstream depends on knowing who you're really selling to.

The four buckets are: ICP (who), Positioning/Marketing (what to say), Demand Gen (how to reach), and Sales (how to close). Address them in sequence.

## How It Works

**Bucket 1: Ideal Customer Profile (Who)**
- Who do we really want to sell to?
- What are their qualifications?
- What discovery questions reveal those qualifications?
- What are the kill criteria (if this is true, do NOT sign them)?

**Key Exercise:** "Of your existing customers, which one is your favorite? Which one would salivate openly with a chance to evangelize what you're doing for them?" Describe that customer in detail—that's your ICP.

**Bucket 2: Positioning/Marketing (What to Say)**
- Who are we competing against? (Companies or status quo)
- What are they great at?
- What are we great at?
- What's our "uncommon denominator"—what are we great at that they're not?
- How do we represent that in the world? (Brand, artifacts, identity)

**Bucket 3: Demand Gen (How to Reach)**
- How do we find the humans we want?
- Use the Traction book's 19 channels as a starting point
- Expand aperture beyond "how you did it at your last company" (availability bias)
- Use brain writing (not brainstorming) to generate ideas
- Prioritize: high impact, low effort experiments across 3-4 channels

**Brain Writing:** Everyone writes ideas independently before sharing—avoids founder's "megaphone effect" and levels playing field between introverts/extroverts, fast/slow processors.

**Bucket 4: Sales (How to Close)**
- Codify the playbook
- How do we do discovery?
- How do we handle objections?
- How do we demo?
- How do we move to close?

**After these four:** Only then worry about deployment, customer success, upselling, account management. "Those are good problems to have."

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with ICP** - This is the most important and most skipped bucket. Don't move forward until you can describe your perfect customer in detail.

2. **Define kill criteria** - Equally important to knowing who you want is knowing who you don't want. If X is true, walk away.

3. **Build from your white-hot center** - Don't worry about TAM yet. Find a small population that is an enormous fan. "Amazon just sold books. We can start with one thing and be great at it."

4. **Work the funnel math honestly** - Don't start with "I need to be at $X revenue." Start with recent history and make reasonable assumptions about how you can influence the funnel going forward.

5. **Use brain writing for demand gen ideas** - Expose the idea, have everyone write independently, combine without authorship, then discuss.

## When to Use It

- When feeling overwhelmed by "go-to-market strategy"
- When moving from founder-led sales to a scalable motion
- When sales feel random rather than repeatable
- When preparing for a GTM-focused board conversation
- When diagnosing why growth has stalled
- When onboarding a new sales or marketing leader
