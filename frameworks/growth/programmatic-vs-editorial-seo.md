# Programmatic vs Editorial SEO

> "Programmatic is the right solution when there's scale and when there's a user use case. If there is not, you create scale for nothing." - Eli Schwartz

## What It Is

This framework helps you choose between two fundamentally different approaches to SEO based on your business model and user needs.

**Programmatic SEO**: Building pages at scale by combining data sources into templated pages. Think Zillow's property listings, TripAdvisor's hotel pages, or Zapier's integration pages. You're not writing each page—you're building a system that generates thousands or millions of pages from structured data.

**Editorial SEO**: Creating individual pieces of long-form content by hand. Think blog posts, guides, reviews, and thought leadership. Each piece is crafted, edited, and published manually.

The choice isn't about what's "better"—it's about what matches your user's needs and your business model.

## How It Works

**Programmatic SEO:**

- Takes multiple data sources and combines them into comprehensive pages
- Creates pages at scale (thousands to millions)
- Works best when users are looking for specific, structured information
- Requires engineering resources to build the templating system
- Examples: Property listings, product catalogs, integration pages, local pages

**Editorial SEO:**

- Creates individual pieces of content by hand
- Works at smaller scale (dozens to hundreds of pieces)
- Works best for thought leadership, complex topics, and brand building
- Requires content writers, editors, and subject matter experts
- Examples: Blog posts, guides, industry analysis, comparison pieces

**Key Decision Factors:**

1. **User use case**: Is someone actually searching for what you'd create at scale?
2. **Data availability**: Do you have the structured data to power programmatic pages?
3. **Conversion path**: Does the page connect to what you monetize?
4. **Resource trade-offs**: Can you build the system, or hire the writers?

## How to Apply It

**Choose Programmatic when:**

1. You have structured data that can power pages at scale (properties, products, integrations, locations)
2. Users are searching for specific, predictable queries (Gmail + Salesforce, hotels in Miami)
3. Each page serves a distinct user need (not just keyword variations)
4. Your monetization connects to what the page offers

**Choose Editorial when:**

1. You're establishing thought leadership or expertise
2. The topic requires depth, nuance, or original research
3. You can't generate useful pages from templates
4. You're targeting a "fat head" of high-value queries

**Avoid the common mistakes:**

- **Programmatic without use case**: Building pages for every zip code when no one searches that way
- **Editorial at impossible scale**: Trying to write long-form content for millions of variations
- **Copying without fit**: Replicating Zapier's programmatic approach when you don't have their data or use case

## When to Use It

**Programmatic SEO is ideal for:**

- Marketplaces (listings, products, services)
- SaaS with integrations or templates
- Local businesses with multiple locations
- E-commerce product catalogs
- Any business with structured, searchable data

**Editorial SEO is ideal for:**

- B2B companies building authority
- Media and content businesses
- Companies with complex products requiring explanation
- Thought leadership and brand building
- Topics that can't be templated

## Examples

**TripAdvisor (Programmatic):**
- Combines hotel data, location data, and user reviews into comprehensive pages
- Doesn't write individual pieces about each hotel
- Users search "hotels in [city]" and find exactly what they need
- Each page serves a clear user journey (research → book)

**Zillow (Programmatic):**
- Combines government data, market data, photos, and user content
- Creates pages for every property in America
- Users search "[address] value" and get comprehensive information
- SEO is the only channel that could drive traffic to individual property pages

**Zapier (Programmatic):**
- Built pages for every possible integration combination
- "Gmail + Salesforce integration" leads to a page showing it's possible
- Creates flywheel: if Gmail works with Salesforce, what else does Gmail work with?

**SurveyMonkey (Fat Head Editorial):**
- Had a "fat head" of templates people actually searched for
- Could create ~100 high-value template pages
- Couldn't scale to 10,000 because no one was searching for most combinations
