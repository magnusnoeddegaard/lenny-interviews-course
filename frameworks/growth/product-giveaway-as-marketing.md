# Product Giveaway as Marketing

> "If somebody, one of our users stands up and say, 'Hey, I'm going to have a hackathon at my work on Lovable, can you give us some free credits to play with?' Why would we prevent a person who wants to do all of the marketing and activating for us from using us? We're like, 'Take it, how much do you need?'" - Elena Verna

## What It Is

Product Giveaway as Marketing is a growth strategy where companies aggressively give away their product (especially AI credits, access, or usage) to users who will evangelize on their behalf. Rather than viewing free usage as a cost to minimize, it's treated as a marketing investment that's more efficient than paid acquisition.

This goes beyond standard freemium. Freemium is baseline—the expectation. Product giveaway means proactively finding evangelists and giving them whatever they need to spread your product: free credits for hackathons, unlimited access for influential users, sponsorship for community events.

## How It Works

**The Economics:**

Traditional thinking treats product costs (especially AI/LLM costs) as something to minimize. This framework flips the script:

- **Cost Center Thinking**: "Our margin is 40%, we need to gate free usage"
- **Marketing Investment Thinking**: "Every free credit is cheaper than paid advertising"

For AI companies, the math often works:
- No large headcount costs (small teams)
- No expensive sales teams (product-led)
- No major paid marketing spend
- Therefore: room to invest in product giveaways

**The Mechanism:**

1. Users try your product for free
2. Wow moments create desire to share
3. Evangelists emerge who want to spread the product
4. You give them whatever they need to do your marketing
5. Their networks become your acquisition channel
6. Cost per eyeball is lower than competing on AdWords

**What to Give Away:**

- Credits for hackathons (internal company hackathons, community events)
- Extended trials for influential users
- Free access for ambassadors and community leaders
- Sponsorship for user-organized events
- Unlimited usage for internal champions at target companies

## How to Apply It

1. **Reframe the budget** - Track LLM/product costs as marketing costs, not COGS. Compare cost-per-eyeball against paid channels.

2. **Create a giveaway program** - Establish clear processes for approving free access: hackathons, ambassadors, community events, influential users.

3. **Identify evangelists** - Look for users who want to spread your product. These are your highest-leverage marketing investments.

4. **Make it easy to request** - Don't create barriers. When someone asks to sponsor a hackathon, say yes immediately and ask how much they need.

5. **Sponsor generously** - Give more than asked. Create a memorable experience that gets talked about.

6. **Track downstream value** - Monitor how giveaways convert to paid users, word of mouth, and brand awareness.

## When to Use It

- **AI and high-marginal-cost products** - Where per-user costs are real but acquisition value is high
- **New categories** - Where people need to try before they understand the value
- **Competitive markets** - Where you're competing for mindshare and can't win on paid advertising
- **Products with wow moments** - Where trying it creates desire to share
- **Community-driven products** - Where users naturally organize events and want to share

## Cautions

- **Doesn't work without wow** - If your product doesn't create wow moments, free access won't help
- **Needs discipline** - Track ROI. Not all giveaways are equal.
- **Scale challenges** - May not work for every business model or stage
- **Requires saying yes** - This strategy fails if approval processes create friction
