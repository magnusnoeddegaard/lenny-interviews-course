# Full Funnel Audit

> "When I think about pick a starting point, one thing I actually do with a lot of my advisory clients as a first step is, we do a full funnel audit, full PLG funnel audit. Think about, we go through me as a kind of end user, go through the entire journey, pretend I am interested, semi interested, and I want to buy from the website... You will never believe, like when I do this audit, there are so many low hanging fruits usually in this process." - Hila Qu

## What It Is

The Full Funnel Audit is a systematic process for evaluating your product-led growth funnel by going through the entire user journey yourself - from landing page to purchase - while identifying friction points, confusing moments, and drop-off risks at each stage.

The goal is to find leverage: areas where relatively small improvements can drive disproportionate results. By combining the qualitative experience of being a user with quantitative data about conversion rates at each step, you can identify the highest-impact optimization opportunities.

This is typically the first step Hila Qu takes with advisory clients, and it consistently reveals low-hanging fruit that companies have overlooked.

## How It Works

### The Four-Stage Audit

**Stage 1: Marketing Site / Landing Page**
- Is the value proposition clear and compelling?
- Does it attract you to try the product?
- Is the CTA prominent and action-oriented?
- Is it clear what you'll get (free trial, freemium, demo)?

**Stage 2: Signup / Onboarding**
- Is the signup process smooth?
- Are you asked unnecessary questions?
- Do you understand what to do next?
- Can you start using the product quickly?

**Stage 3: First Use / Activation**
- Do you reach an aha moment?
- Or are you confused and frustrated?
- Do you know which features to try?
- Are there warm starts (templates, sample data)?

**Stage 4: Checkout / Conversion**
- Can you find where to buy?
- Is pricing clear and understandable?
- Is the checkout process smooth?
- Are there unnecessary form fields or friction?

### Supplement with Data

After the qualitative audit, request high-level data for each step:
- How many visitors reach the site?
- How many sign up?
- How many reach the aha moment?
- How many start checkout?
- How many successfully purchase?

The combination of your experience and the data reveals where the biggest drops occur and why.

### Bonus: Email Audit

Review the first several emails sent to new users:
- Do they help you return to the product?
- Do they guide you toward activation?
- Are the CTAs clear and compelling?

## How to Apply It

1. **Clear your cache and use incognito** - Experience your product as a true first-time user

2. **Go through the entire journey** - From Google search or homepage to completed purchase

3. **Take notes at each moment** - Note confusion, friction, delight, and drop-off risks

4. **Score each stage** - Rate the experience: Does this make me want to continue?

5. **Gather the data** - Request conversion rates between each stage from your analytics team

6. **Identify leverage points** - Look for stages with both poor experience AND low conversion

7. **Prioritize by impact** - Usually activation and conversion are the highest-leverage areas

### Common Issues Found in Audits

- **Checkout**: Confusing pricing, unnecessary form fields, missing payment options for certain regions
- **Activation**: No guidance on what to do, too many options, no warm start
- **Signup**: Too many questions, unclear value prop, missing social proof
- **Marketing**: CTA is "Book Demo" instead of "Try Free"

## When to Use It

- As the first step when adding a PLG motion
- Quarterly as a product health check
- When conversion rates drop unexpectedly
- Before major funnel redesigns
- When onboarding a new growth team or advisor
