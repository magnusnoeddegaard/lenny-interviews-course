# Collison Install

> "They developed this tactic to be like, 'Oh, well, I'm in the neighborhood, I'll drop by your office to help you implement Stripe.' And they basically would not go away until you finish the implementation of Stripe." - Dalton Caldwell

## What It Is

The Collison Install is a sales and customer success tactic developed by Patrick and John Collison in Stripe's early days. Instead of just closing a sale and hoping the customer implements, you physically show up and do the implementation yourself—making it awkward and difficult for the customer to not complete the setup.

The tactic recognizes a fundamental gap in enterprise sales: getting a "yes" is not the same as getting a customer. Many deals die in the implementation phase when customers go quiet, get busy, or deprioritize the integration. The Collison Install eliminates this failure mode through sheer presence.

## How It Works

**The Problem It Solves**

When selling software (especially to developers):
1. Customer says "yes, I want to buy this"
2. Customer goes quiet
3. Implementation never happens
4. Customer eventually churns (or never truly starts)

You've failed on the one-yard line. All your sales effort was wasted.

**The Tactic**

1. **Manufacture proximity**: "Oh, I'm in the neighborhood anyway"
2. **Offer to help**: "Let me drop by to help you implement"
3. **Get hands on keyboard**: "Can I drive? Can I have the keyboard?"
4. **Don't leave until it's done**: "Cool, can we roll out the website now?"

The key is being charmingly persistent. You're providing genuine white-glove service while also making it socially uncomfortable to not complete the implementation.

**Why It Works**

- Removes friction from the customer's side
- Creates social accountability (harder to ghost someone in person)
- Catches implementation problems immediately
- Shows you genuinely care about their success
- Accelerates time-to-value

## How to Apply It

1. **Reframe your sales process**: The sale isn't done when they say yes—it's done when they're live

2. **Build in implementation touchpoints**:
   - Schedule the "kickoff" call before they can delay
   - Offer on-site implementation help
   - Create urgency around getting live

3. **Make it easy to say yes**:
   - Position it as premium support
   - Come to them (don't make them come to you)
   - Frame it as "I'm just in the area"

4. **Stay until completion**:
   - Don't leave after starting the integration
   - Push for the full deployment
   - Test it together before you go

5. **Follow up relentlessly**:
   - Patrick Collison would message early customers weekly
   - Check in on how implementation is going
   - Be extremely available

## When to Use It

- Early-stage startups with developer/technical products
- Any product with a meaningful implementation barrier
- When customers consistently ghost after saying yes
- When time-to-value is dragging
- When churn is happening before true activation

## When NOT to Use It

- At scale (this doesn't scale, by design)
- When customers genuinely need time to evaluate
- When you're being pushy rather than helpful
- When there's no real implementation needed

## The Scaling Question

This obviously doesn't scale—that's the point. It's a zero-to-one tactic for getting your first customers truly activated. Once you understand why customers struggle to implement, you can:
- Build better onboarding flows
- Create self-serve documentation
- Hire customer success teams
- Automate the friction points

But first, you need to learn by doing it manually yourself.

## Stripe Context

Dalton shares that he was an early Stripe customer:
- Patrick would message him weekly on Google Talk "just checking in"
- Patrick was "very hands-on with all of his customers"
- This personal attention helped Stripe understand exactly what customers needed

The result: Stripe is now worth over $100 billion, and its onboarding is legendarily smooth. That didn't happen by accident—it came from doing thousands of manual installs first.
