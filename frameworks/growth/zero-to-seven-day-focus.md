# Zero to Seven Day Focus

> "Once you get to seven days, loss aversion kicks in, and you retain. Going from a one to a two-day streak, huge jump in retention, two to three day streak, slightly less but still huge and it's up until day seven. Once you hit day seven, it flattens out." - Jackson Shuttleworth

## What It Is

The Zero to Seven Day Focus is a retention strategy based on Duolingo's discovery that the first seven days of a streak are disproportionately important for long-term retention. Before day seven, users can easily abandon their streak. After day seven, loss aversion psychology kicks in and users are dramatically more likely to continue.

This insight changes how you allocate resources: instead of spreading effort evenly across the user journey, you should invest heavily in getting users past the seven-day threshold. The jump from day 30 to day 31 matters far less than the jump from day 6 to day 7.

## How It Works

### The Retention Curve Pattern

- **Day 1 → Day 2**: Massive retention improvement per user who returns
- **Day 2 → Day 3**: Slightly less, but still huge
- **Days 3-7**: Diminishing but significant gains each day
- **Day 7+**: Curve flattens—additional days matter, but at a different magnitude

### Why Seven Days?

The seven-day threshold likely relates to:
- **Habit formation**: One full week establishes a pattern
- **Loss aversion activation**: Seven days feels like "something real" to lose
- **Weekly pattern completion**: Users prove they can fit the product into their routine
- **Psychological milestone**: A week is a natural mental boundary

### Investment Implications

Duolingo runs more experiments on the 0-7 day experience than any other period:
- Extra streak freezes for new users
- Goal-setting prompts early in the journey
- Enhanced explanations of how streaks work
- More aggressive save mechanisms
- Additional motivation/celebration at each early milestone

## How to Apply It

1. **Map your retention curve**
   - Track return rates by streak day or cohort day
   - Identify where the curve flattens (your "loss aversion threshold")
   - This may not be day 7 for your product—test to find yours

2. **Front-load flexibility**
   - Give new users extra forgiveness (e.g., free streak freezes)
   - Make it easier to recover from early misses
   - Reduce friction for the first week specifically

3. **Invest in early education**
   - Explain the mechanic clearly on day 1
   - Show users how the streak works
   - Communicate the value of continuing (e.g., "Users with 30-day streaks are 7x more likely to finish")

4. **Celebrate early milestones**
   - Make day 3, day 5, day 7 feel special
   - Use animation, haptics, messaging
   - Create anticipation for the next milestone

5. **Measure experiments by cohort day**
   - Track day 1 vs day 7 vs day 14 impact
   - Prioritize changes that show stronger day 14 impact (true retention)
   - Watch for novelty effects that fade after initial exposure

## When to Use It

- When designing onboarding and early user experiences
- When allocating experimentation resources
- When deciding where to add flexibility vs. friction
- When building habit-forming products
