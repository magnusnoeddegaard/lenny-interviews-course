# Gamification Three Pillars

> "Jorge had this model of gamification patterns having essentially three pillars to it. You have the core loop, you have the metagame, and then you have the profile." - Albert Cheng

## What It Is

The Gamification Three Pillars framework structures product engagement into three complementary layers that together create lasting habits. Developed at Duolingo, this model ensures that gamification isn't random game mechanics bolted on, but a coherent system that drives short-term action, long-term motivation, and personal investment.

Each pillar serves a different time horizon:
- **Core Loop** - What brings users back daily
- **Metagame** - What gives them long-term goals
- **Profile** - What makes them invested in staying

## How It Works

### 1. Core Loop (Daily Habit)
The tight feedback cycle that creates daily engagement:
- User takes an action
- Gets immediate reward/feedback
- Builds toward a milestone (streak, daily goal)
- Receives reminder to return

**Example (Duolingo):**
- Do a lesson → Earn XP → Extend streak → Get push notification tomorrow

**Goal:** Make the daily action feel rewarding and create anticipation for the next session.

### 2. Metagame (Long-term Goals)
Larger systems that give meaning to the daily grind:
- Achievement systems
- Leaderboards and leagues
- Progress paths/skill trees
- Unlockable content

**Example (Duolingo):**
- The learning path with units and levels
- Weekly leaderboard leagues (Bronze → Diamond)
- Achievement badges

**Goal:** Give users something to strive for beyond today's session.

### 3. Profile (Personal Investment)
The accumulation of identity and progress:
- Stats and history
- Streaks and milestones
- Social features and followers
- Personalization and avatar

**Example (Duolingo):**
- Streak count (loss aversion)
- Total XP earned
- Completed courses
- Friend connections

**Goal:** Create switching costs through accumulated investment.

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your three pillars** - Map your current features to each pillar. Where are the gaps?

2. **Start with the core loop** - If your daily habit isn't tight, nothing else matters. Optimize for:
   - Clear action → immediate feedback → reward → anticipation
   - Short sessions (< 5 minutes)
   - Low friction to start

3. **Layer in metagame** - Once the core loop works, add longer-term structures:
   - What do users work toward over weeks/months?
   - How do they see progress?
   - What's the "leaderboard" for your product?

4. **Build the profile** - Make accumulated progress visible and valuable:
   - Show history and stats
   - Make streaks visible and meaningful
   - Add social proof elements

5. **Connect the pillars** - The best systems link all three:
   - Daily actions feed metagame progress
   - Metagame achievements appear on profile
   - Profile investments increase core loop stakes

## Example: Chess.com Application

**Core Loop:**
- Play a game (3-10 min) → See rating change → Review with coach → Get daily puzzle notification

**Metagame:**
- Rating system (Elo progression)
- Puzzle rating
- Lessons completion path
- Achievements/badges

**Profile:**
- Rating history graph
- Games played count
- Win/loss record
- Friends and followers

## When to Use It

- Consumer products with daily or weekly engagement goals
- Products where habit formation is critical to value delivery
- Products with a learning or progression component
- Products competing with entertainment alternatives

## Common Mistakes

- **Only core loop** - Users engage but don't see purpose, eventually churn
- **Only metagame** - Goals feel arbitrary without daily satisfaction
- **Only profile** - Users invested but no reason to return daily
- **Disconnected pillars** - Game mechanics feel bolted on, not coherent
