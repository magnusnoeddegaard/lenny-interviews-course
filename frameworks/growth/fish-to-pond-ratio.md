# Fish to Pond Ratio

> "We talk a lot about fish to pond ratio. You want to be... your first pond, your target segment, should be something that in the next two years, if you hit your really high growth rates, you could be 30, 40, 50% of the market share in that segment. That would cause partners to go, 'Whoa, if we're going to serve that segment, we got to work with these guys.'" - Geoffrey Moore

## What It Is

Fish to Pond Ratio is a market sizing principle for choosing your initial target segment. The "fish" is your company; the "pond" is the market segment. The ratio determines whether you can achieve the market leadership position needed to attract an ecosystem of partners.

The key insight: ecosystems form around market leaders and do not form around the rest of us. If you can't become a big fish in your chosen pond, you won't attract the partners, integrations, and references you need to cross the chasm.

This directly contradicts the common startup instinct to chase the biggest possible market. A huge addressable market might look good on pitch decks, but if you're a tiny fish in that ocean, you'll never achieve the dominance needed to build momentum.

## How It Works

### The Math of Market Leadership

To attract an ecosystem, you need to become the obvious leader in your segment:

- **Target**: 30-50% market share within 2 years
- **Why 2 years**: That's roughly the time horizon for proving your Crossing the Chasm strategy
- **Why 30-50%**: At this share, partners see you as essential to serving the segment

If your segment is a billion dollars, "you might be able to get there, but you would not be a big fish."

### Why Ecosystems Matter

The entire Crossing the Chasm strategy depends on ecosystem formation:

1. **Pragmatists buy what their peers buy** - You need concentration of wins in a segment
2. **Partners join market leaders** - Consultants, integrators, and complementary vendors work with whoever dominates
3. **Ecosystem reinforces leadership** - Partners bring you deals, making you more dominant
4. **Ecosystem barriers to entry** - Once formed, competitors can't easily replicate your partner network

"If you're a category leader, if you're like Oracle and Databases, you're 40 years in. You're still the leader because the ecosystem organized around you."

### How to Size Your Pond

A segment is defined by:
- **Geography** - Same country/region (people across regions don't talk)
- **Industry** - Same vertical (dentists don't talk to software designers)
- **Profession** - Same role (sales doesn't talk to warehouse)
- **Use Case** - Same compelling problem

**Test**: Can you identify the top 20 potential customers? Do they know each other? Would they talk to each other about buying decisions?

### The Billion Dollar Trap

Many startups target markets that are too large:

- **"Our TAM is $50 billion"** - Great for pitch decks, terrible for crossing the chasm
- **A billion-dollar segment** - You'll never achieve 30-50% share before running out of runway
- **The Fortune 500 as your beachhead** - Not a segment at all; just a diverse list of large companies

## How to Apply It

**1. Start with Your Growth Math**

A typical VC trajectory expectation: "triple double, double triple" (1M → 4M → 12M → 24M → 48M → 96M)

Your segment needs to support getting from ~$10M to ~$100M, but NOT be so large that you can't lead it.

**2. Draw Your Segment Boundaries**

Define geography, industry, profession, and use case tightly enough that:
- You can realistically serve 30-50% of the segment in 2 years
- Customers in the segment talk to each other
- A few reference wins will create word-of-mouth

**3. Do the Fish-to-Pond Math**

If you're targeting $100M ARR in 5 years with ~50% market share:
- Your segment should be roughly $200M
- Not $20M (too small—not big enough to matter)
- Not $2B (too big—you'll never achieve leadership)

**4. Validate with the "Top 20" Test**

Can you name the top 20 potential customers in your segment? If you can, and they're coherent as a group, you've probably sized it right.

### Adjacent Expansion After Dominance

Once you dominate your initial pond, you expand to adjacent ponds:

- **Same customer, new use case** - Use your customer relationships
- **Same use case, new customer segment** - Use your ecosystem partners

"The bowling alley metaphor is... how could you win your first segment, but then increasingly, how would you go forward to win it?"

This is why adjacency matters—your ecosystem and references carry over to adjacent segments but not to distant ones.

## Anti-Patterns

**"We'll pursue all segments simultaneously"**

Like running multiple presidential primaries at once. "Votes in Vermont do not count in New Hampshire." You achieve leadership nowhere.

**"We need a billion-dollar market for VCs"**

VCs want a path to a billion-dollar outcome. That's different from starting in a billion-dollar market. The path: dominate a small segment, expand to adjacent segments, eventually compete in large markets.

**"Any customer is a good customer"**

Running the match back and forth under the log. No fire starts because you never concentrate enough heat in one place.
