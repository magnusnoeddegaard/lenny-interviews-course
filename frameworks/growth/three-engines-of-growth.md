# Three Engines of Growth

> "The law of sustainable growth is a situation where new customers come as a natural side effect of the actions of past customers." - Eric Ries

## What It Is

The Three Engines of Growth is a framework from The Lean Startup methodology that categorizes all sustainable startup growth into three distinct models. Each engine represents a different feedback loop where the actions of existing customers drive the acquisition of new customers.

The key insight is that sustainable growth doesn't come from heroic marketing efforts or paid acquisition alone—it comes from building growth into the product itself. Every startup should identify which engine powers their growth and optimize for that specific feedback loop.

## How It Works

### 1. The Viral Engine

New customers come from referrals and word-of-mouth driven by existing customers.

**Key Metric**: Viral coefficient (how many new users each existing user brings in)

**How it works**:
- Users share the product because it's inherently social or shareable
- Each user brings in more than one additional user on average
- Growth compounds as the user base expands

**Examples**: Facebook (social network effects), Dropbox (sharing files), PayPal ("You've got money")

### 2. The Sticky Engine

Growth comes from high retention—keeping customers longer than competitors do.

**Key Metric**: Churn rate (how many customers leave each period)

**How it works**:
- Customers stay engaged through habit loops and high switching costs
- Low churn means the customer base compounds over time
- New acquisition only needs to exceed (low) churn for net growth

**Examples**: World of Warcraft (habit formation), subscription services with high engagement

### 3. The Paid Engine

Growth comes from investing revenue into acquiring new customers profitably.

**Key Metric**: Marginal profit per customer (revenue minus cost of serving)

**How it works**:
- Each customer generates more revenue than they cost to serve
- Marginal profit is reinvested into customer acquisition
- As long as CAC < LTV, growth continues

**Examples**: Enterprise sales, companies with high margins and clear CAC/LTV ratios

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your primary engine**: Most successful startups are powered by one dominant engine, not all three. Spreading focus across engines dilutes effectiveness.

2. **Measure the right thing**: Track the key metric for your engine religiously:
   - Viral: Measure viral coefficient and cycle time
   - Sticky: Measure retention curves and engagement loops
   - Paid: Measure CAC, LTV, and payback period

3. **Optimize the loop**: Once you know your engine, every product decision should strengthen that specific feedback loop.

4. **Layer engines over time**: As Eric notes, mature companies often add additional engines every 18 months as existing loops spin out.

## When to Use It

- When defining your growth strategy and metrics
- When prioritizing features (which ones strengthen your engine?)
- When diagnosing why growth has stalled
- When evaluating if a pivot changes your growth model
