# Time to Value Hierarchy

> "I usually think about do is better than show is better than tell, meaning you want to remove all the frictions and somehow give them a warm start, give them some sample template, give them some sample thing they can play with initially in that very moment already, and you can supplement that with your email to bring them to the product if they don't do that." - Hila Qu

## What It Is

The Time to Value Hierarchy is a prioritization framework for designing activation experiences in PLG products. It establishes a clear hierarchy: letting users DO something valuable immediately is better than SHOWING them what's possible, which is better than TELLING them about the product.

The goal is to reduce the time between signup and when users experience the core value of your product. The faster they reach the aha moment, the more likely they are to convert and retain.

## How It Works

### The Hierarchy (Best to Worst)

**Level 1: DO - Let Users Take Action Immediately**
- Provide templates, sample data, or pre-configured states
- Enable them to experience value in their first session
- Remove all setup friction that delays value
- Example: Miro asks your use case and immediately drops you into a relevant template

**Level 2: SHOW - Demonstrate Value Through Experience**
- Interactive demos with real (or realistic) data
- Guided tours through key features
- Sandbox environments where they can explore
- Example: Amplitude's interactive demo before you've set up tracking

**Level 3: TELL - Explain the Value Proposition**
- Onboarding copy and tooltips
- Explainer videos
- Documentation and help articles
- Email sequences describing features

### The Warm Start Principle

A "warm start" means users don't start from a blank slate:
- Sample projects or workspaces already created
- Templates for common use cases
- Example data they can play with
- Pre-configured settings based on their answers

This eliminates the "cold start problem" where users sign up, see an empty state, and don't know what to do next.

### Mini Aha Moments

For complex products, you may not be able to deliver the full aha moment in 5 minutes. Instead, design for "mini aha moments" - smaller wins that build confidence:
- First successful action completed
- First integration connected
- First output generated
- Each mini win increases commitment to continue

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your current onboarding** - Where does it fall on the hierarchy? Are you mostly telling, showing, or enabling doing?

2. **Identify the fastest path to value** - What's the minimum a user needs to do to experience your core value?

3. **Design warm starts** - Create templates, sample data, or pre-configured states for common use cases

4. **Ask use case upfront** - If you ask what users want to accomplish, you can personalize the warm start

5. **Supplement with email** - Use lifecycle email to bring users back who haven't reached the aha moment

6. **Measure time to value** - Track how long it takes users to reach key activation milestones

### Example Implementation

**Before (TELL-heavy):**
1. User signs up
2. Empty dashboard with tutorial video
3. Documentation link
4. User leaves, confused

**After (DO-focused):**
1. User signs up
2. Asked: "What's your main goal?"
3. Dropped into pre-populated template for that goal
4. Guided to complete one meaningful action
5. User experiences value, wants to continue

## When to Use It

- When designing or redesigning onboarding
- When activation rates are low
- When users sign up but don't convert
- When user feedback mentions confusion or complexity
- When competing products have simpler onboarding
