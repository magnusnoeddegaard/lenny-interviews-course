# PLG Definition

> "At the highest level, [PLG is] taking a go-to-market approach where your product's job is to grow revenue and you use humans as a backstop and not the other way around." - Christopher Miller

## What It Is

Christopher Miller's definition of product-led growth cuts through common confusion by clarifying the relationship between product and humans in the go-to-market motion. PLG doesn't mean "no humans" - it means the product is the primary driver of revenue growth, with humans supporting where needed.

This definition resolves the false dichotomy between PLG and sales-led approaches. The question isn't whether to have sales, but whether the product or humans are the primary engine.

## How It Works

### Traditional (Sales-Led) Approach
```
Human sells → Product demonstrates → Customer buys
Humans = Primary driver
Product = Supporting role
```

### Product-Led Approach
```
Product demonstrates → Human assists → Customer buys
Product = Primary driver
Humans = Backstop/support
```

### Key Distinction
The difference isn't presence/absence of humans, but their role:
- **Sales-led**: Humans initiate, qualify, convince, close
- **Product-led**: Product initiates, qualifies, convinces; humans close or assist

## How to Apply It

### Use This Definition To:

1. **Align stakeholders** - Get shared understanding before PLG initiatives
2. **Design customer journeys** - Determine where product vs. humans lead
3. **Structure teams** - Clarify growth vs. sales responsibilities
4. **Evaluate progress** - Are you shifting the primary driver from humans to product?

### Questions to Clarify PLG Intent

When someone says "we want to be more PLG," ask:
- "What outcomes are you hoping to achieve?"
- "What do you mean by product-led?"
- "Where should product lead vs. humans lead?"
- "What's your current ratio of product vs. human-driven revenue?"

### Common Misconceptions This Definition Corrects

| Misconception | Reality per Miller |
|--------------|-------------------|
| PLG = No sales team | Humans are backstop, not absent |
| PLG = Fully self-service | Some stages may need human involvement |
| PLG = One approach | Modular - apply differently by stage/segment |
| PLG = Cheaper | Investment shifts from sales to product/engineering |

## When to Use It

Use this definition when:

- **Starting PLG initiatives**: Establish shared vocabulary first
- **Evaluating PLG maturity**: How much revenue flows through product?
- **Resolving sales/product tensions**: Both have legitimate roles
- **Setting strategy**: Determine where to invest in product vs. sales capacity
- **Measuring progress**: Track shift in revenue attribution
