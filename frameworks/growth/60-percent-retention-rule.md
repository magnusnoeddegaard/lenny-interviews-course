# 60% Retention Rule

> "If it's a free product, 60%. It has to be at least 60%... And this is at scale. So if you are much smaller, your friends and family that better be near close to 80% no matter what, because if you can't even convince the people who care about you to use the product, it probably isn't going to solve the job for anyone else." - Crystal Widjaja

## What It Is

The 60% Retention Rule is a concrete benchmark for evaluating product-market fit in free consumer products. If you can't retain at least 60% of users from week 0 to week 1 (with the curve flattening afterwards), your product likely doesn't have sufficient PMF to scale.

The rule has two variants based on stage:
- **Early stage (friends & family)**: Aim for 80%+ week-one retention
- **At scale**: Aim for 60%+ week-one retention with a flattening curve

For paid products, the benchmark drops to 20-30% because the payment itself filters for commitment.

## How It Works

### The Benchmark
1. **Measure cohort retention** - Track what percentage of users who signed up in week 0 return in week 1
2. **Watch the curve shape** - Retention should flatten after week 1, not continue declining
3. **Compare to benchmarks**:
   - Free product, early stage: 80%+
   - Free product, at scale: 60%+
   - Paid product: 20-30%+

### Why These Numbers?
Crystal saw these retention rates at Gojek during their hypergrowth period: "Early days it was like 60, 70% retention rates because people were using this product that really solved a huge problem for them. And I think that's when I knew we were going to be fine."

### The Early Adopter Caveat
Your earliest users (friends, family, early adopters) are more excited and forgiving. Their retention will be higher than later cohorts. If you can't hit 80% with people who actively want you to succeed, you won't hit 60% at scale.

## How to Apply It

1. **Set up cohort tracking** - Track week 0 → week 1 retention by signup cohort

2. **Be honest about your stage** - Don't apply at-scale benchmarks to friends-and-family numbers

3. **Watch the curve, not just the number** - Retention should flatten after the initial drop. Continuous decay signals bigger problems.

4. **Adjust for product type**:
   - Weekly-use products: Use weekly retention
   - Monthly-use products: Use monthly retention
   - Match your frequency to user expectations

5. **If you're below threshold** - Focus on product fundamentals, not growth tactics. "If people keep coming back, the product just needs to work."

## When to Use It

- Evaluating product-market fit before scaling growth
- Deciding whether to invest in acquisition vs. product improvement
- Setting team OKRs around retention
- Comparing different product initiatives

## Example: Gojek

"Early days it was like 60, 70% retention rates because people were using this product that really solved a huge problem for them. And I think that's when I knew we were going to be fine."

Traffic in Indonesia was so painful (2 hours for 20 kilometers) that users who experienced Gojek's motorcycle taxi service kept coming back. The retention numbers confirmed what Crystal intuitively felt about PMF.

## Anti-Pattern: Netflix/Spotify International

"Don't make the same mistake that Netflix and Spotify have made... when they launch in these markets and they see a ton of uptick in the first week, they're like, 'This is only going to get better.' When in reality it's like you just pulled forward everyone who could have possibly subscribed to you."

Early retention can be artificially high because you've captured all early adopters. Expect retention to decline as you reach mainstream users.
