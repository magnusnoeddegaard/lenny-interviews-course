# Zero CAC Through Trust

> "The huge advantage that we've had and why we've resonated so fast in the marketplace is we built a decade of trust with 18 million people, and they trust us, and we built a ton of brand affinity." - Garrett Lord

## What It Is

Zero CAC Through Trust is a growth model where an established relationship with an audience eliminates traditional customer acquisition costs. Instead of paying to reach potential customers through advertising, recruitment, or sales, you leverage existing trust to achieve near-instant adoption at dramatically lower cost.

This model creates a compounding advantage: while competitors spend tens of millions on performance marketing and employ hundreds of recruiters, you reach the same audience through direct channels they already use and trust. The economics become wildly favorable—not just lower cost, but also higher conversion rates and better retention.

## How It Works

The model operates through three interlocking elements:

**Brand Trust Transfer**: When you've built trust with an audience over years, that trust transfers to new offerings. Handshake built credibility helping students find jobs; that same trust made students willing to join their AI data business without skepticism. An unknown brand asking the same thing gets ignored.

**Distribution Infrastructure**: Beyond trust, you need the actual channels to reach people. Handshake has app installs, email addresses, and active profiles. They don't need to buy ads to reach physics PhDs—they can directly message them based on verified academic credentials.

**Appropriate Value Exchange**: Trust isn't unlimited. The new offering must genuinely serve the audience's interests. Handshake pays PhDs $100-200/hour for work relevant to their expertise. A bait-and-switch would destroy the trust asset.

## How to Apply It

1. **Calculate your trust asset value** - Estimate what competitors would pay in CAC to reach your existing audience. This is the hidden value of your relationship.

2. **Identify adjacencies that serve the audience** - New offerings must genuinely benefit your audience, not just extract value from them. What do they need that you're positioned to provide?

3. **Preserve trust through quality** - Universities wouldn't tolerate Handshake mistreating their students. Partner expectations can create healthy constraints that protect the trust asset.

4. **Design for high LTV** - Zero CAC only matters if you also retain customers. Invest in experience quality because higher retention multiplies the CAC advantage.

## When to Use It

- When launching new products to an existing audience
- When evaluating build vs. buy decisions (acquiring companies for their audience relationships)
- When competitors are spending heavily on paid acquisition
- When deciding which markets to enter based on existing audience fit

## Example

Handshake's AI data business demonstrates the model at scale:

- **Competitors**: Spend $10M+/month on performance ads, employ 200 recruiters sending LinkedIn messages
- **Handshake**: Messages existing students directly through their app, at essentially zero marginal cost
- **Result**: Zero to $50M ARR in four months, on track to exceed $100M in year one

The efficiency gap compounds—competitors must maintain expensive acquisition while Handshake reinvests savings into product quality and expert experience, further widening retention advantages.
