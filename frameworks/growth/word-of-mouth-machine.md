# Word of Mouth Machine

> "When you're early on, your mindset should almost be like you're trying to create a word of mouth machine. If you can get that part right, everything else becomes significantly easier." - Grant Lee

## What It Is

A Word of Mouth Machine is a product so compelling that users naturally share it with others, creating a self-sustaining growth engine. Unlike paid acquisition or marketing campaigns, this organic growth compounds over time and signals true product-market fit.

Grant Lee describes the feeling of achieving this as distinctly different from other forms of growth. After Gamma's initial Product Hunt launch (where they won product of the day, week, and month), signups spiked then flattened. There wasn't strong organic virality—the product couldn't grow on its own. Only after rebuilding the onboarding experience to make the first 30 seconds "feel magical" did they experience true word-of-mouth growth: from hundreds of signups per day to thousands, then tens of thousands—all organic.

## How It Works

The Word of Mouth Machine operates through several reinforcing mechanisms:

1. **Immediate Value Delivery**: Users experience magic quickly enough to want to share
2. **Built-in Sharing Mechanics**: The product naturally gets shared through usage (e.g., presentations are shown to others)
3. **Minimal Friction**: It's dead simple to create and share
4. **Compound Effect**: Each new user becomes a potential recruiter of more users

For B2B products, the mechanism adapts: instead of telling friends, users tell colleagues and former coworkers. The key signal is the same—a healthy chunk of leads coming through unprompted referrals.

## How to Apply It

1. **Measure organic growth explicitly** - Track what percentage of new signups come from direct/branded search (people who've heard about you). For Gamma, over 50% of subscriber growth is word-of-mouth.

2. **Resist the temptation to force growth** - If organic growth isn't happening, don't try to "brute force" your way with ads. Go back to the product.

3. **Make sharing frictionless** - Remove every barrier between using and sharing. The path from creation to sharing should be seamless.

4. **Identify your viral loops** - Understand how your product naturally spreads. For Gamma, presentations are inherently shared with audiences.

5. **Don't fool yourself** - Vanity metrics (Product Hunt wins, press mentions) are not the same as a working growth engine. Be honest about whether momentum is building.

## When to Use It

- **Pre-PMF**: Use organic growth as the primary signal of product-market fit
- **Before scaling marketing**: Wait until word-of-mouth is working before investing in paid acquisition
- **Setting growth strategy**: Keep organic growth above 50% of new users even at scale
- **Evaluating product changes**: Any major change should maintain or improve word-of-mouth dynamics

## Warning Signs Your Machine Isn't Working

- Signups spike then flatten after launches
- Users aren't coming back to the product regularly
- Growth is dependent on continuous marketing spend
- Former users aren't telling colleagues about you
- More than 50% of acquisition comes from paid channels

- [Remarkability Principle](remarkability-principle.md) - Products must be remarkable enough that people talk about them
- [Wow Moment](wow-moment.md) - The moment that creates the desire to share
- [Organic Growth Threshold](organic-growth-threshold.md) - 40-50% of customers should come organically
