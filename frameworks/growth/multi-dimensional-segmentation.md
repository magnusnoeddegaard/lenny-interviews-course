# Multi-Dimensional Segmentation

> "Segmentation is basically how do you carve up the world of companies that exist on the planet to reason about them where they buy differently." - Jeanne DeWitt Grosser

## What It Is

Multi-Dimensional Segmentation goes beyond the typical "small/medium/large" company size framework by adding dimensions that actually change how you sell. While company size affects buying complexity, other attributes affect which products to lead with, what value props resonate, and which customer references to cite.

The framework uses an X-Y axis approach (or more dimensions) where each axis represents an attribute that meaningfully changes the sales motion. This helps you target the right companies, personalize outreach, and deploy sales resources efficiently.

Critically, segmentation isn't just a go-to-market exercise—it's a company exercise. Product teams should understand segments so they can build with specific buyers in mind.

## How It Works

Start with company size (the universal dimension), then add dimensions specific to your business:

**Universal Dimension: Size**
- SMB: Single decision maker, transactional sale
- Mid-market: Small buying team, moderate complexity
- Enterprise: Committees, procurement, complex coordination

**Common Additional Dimensions:**

1. **Growth Potential** (for consumption businesses)
   - High-growth companies (200%+ YoY) are more valuable
   - Worth investing more in acquisition

2. **Business Model**
   - B2B, B2C, B2B2B (platforms), B2B2C (marketplaces)
   - Changes which products to sell and which pain points resonate

3. **Workload Type** (industry/use case)
   - E-commerce vs. SaaS vs. crypto vs. media
   - Different language, different references, different technical needs

4. **Observable Signals**
   - Traffic volume (for web-focused products)
   - Tech stack composition
   - Hiring patterns

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with Your Winners**: Analyze your best customers. What do they have in common beyond size?

2. **Find Revenue Drivers**: Ask your data team "What attributes predict higher revenue?" These should become segmentation dimensions.

3. **Find Conversion Drivers**: What attributes predict higher win rates? These help you target efficiently.

4. **Keep It to 3 Dimensions**: More than three becomes hard to operationalize. You can't slice a sales team into 20 segments.

5. **Make It a Company Framework**: Present segmentation in new hire onboarding. Product managers should think "Which segment is this for?" when building.

6. **Promote and Demote**: Some small companies have attributes that make them enterprise-valuable (like a small company with massive traffic). Promote them to higher-touch treatment.

**Example: Stripe Segmentation**
- X-axis: Size (SMB, Mid-market, Enterprise)
- Y-axis: Growth potential (high-growth vs. steady)
- Third dimension: Business model (B2B, B2C, Platform, Marketplace)

**Example: Vercel Segmentation**
- X-axis: Size (but adjusted by traffic/Crux rank)
- Y-axis: Growth potential
- Third dimension: Workload type (e-commerce, SaaS, crypto, etc.)

## When to Use It

- When you're scaling beyond founder-led sales
- When different customer types need different sales motions
- When you're making decisions about where to invest sales resources
- When your product serves multiple use cases or buyer types
- When you want product teams aligned with go-to-market priorities
