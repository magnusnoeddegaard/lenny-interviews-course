# Compelling Reason to Buy

> "Obviously as an entrepreneur, you have a compelling reason to sell. But what they tend to do is... they think, 'Well, I haven't made my product attractive enough.' So then they say, 'I'm going to make a sexier demo, or I'm going to change my deck.' And that's all about compelling ways to sell, not compelling reasons to buy." - Geoffrey Moore

## What It Is

A critical distinction in B2B selling: the difference between why you want to sell (your features, vision, demo) and why the customer urgently needs to buy (their pain, their problem, their deteriorating situation).

Most entrepreneurs focus on compelling reasons to sell. They perfect their pitch, polish their demo, refine their deck. But pragmatist customers don't care about your product—they care about their problem. If you can't connect with their pain, they won't buy no matter how good your demo is.

The compelling reason to buy is what creates urgency. Without it, pragmatists will take meetings indefinitely, seem interested, but never actually decide. "They don't say no. They just never say yes."

## How It Works

### Compelling Reason to Sell vs. Compelling Reason to Buy

**Compelling Reason to Sell** (What entrepreneurs focus on):
- "Let me show you our demo"
- "Here's what our technology can do"
- "Check out these features"
- "We have AI that..."
- "Our platform enables..."

**Compelling Reason to Buy** (What wins pragmatist deals):
- "This problem is actively getting worse"
- "My boss's boss's boss knows my name" (bad sign)
- "We've tried everything and nothing works"
- "Every day we delay costs us $X"
- "We might lose this customer if we don't fix it"

### What Creates Compelling Reasons to Buy

The customer must have a problem that is:

1. **Severe** - Significant impact on the business
2. **Deteriorating** - Getting worse, not stable
3. **Unresolved** - They've tried other solutions and failed
4. **Personally consequential** - Someone's job or reputation is at stake

**Example**: "If you have to have heart surgery, you don't want a coupon that says, 'Heart surgery 9.99 this Saturday only.' You want to go to the Mayo Clinic."

When the problem is compelling enough, customers don't ask for discounts—they pay for certainty.

### Examples of Compelling Reasons

- **Ransomware** - "All of a sudden the cybersecurity thing is like holy smoke because it used to be, 'Well, they wouldn't attack my company.'"
- **Regulatory compliance** - "We have these regulatory demands on us. The FDA doesn't wait."
- **Competitive pressure** - "Every day we lose patent life is worth $1-2M."
- **Customer churn** - "How about if you help SaaS companies deal with churn? Do you think they would care about that?"
- **Post-pandemic office** - "What am I supposed to do with my office space? Do I design it the way we used to?"

### The Doctor Analogy

Your sales call should feel like visiting a doctor, not watching a product demo:

**Wrong approach** (patient perspective):
"Can I show you a movie of the operation I just did? I want to give you a demo. Mind if I give you a demo?"

**Right approach** (doctor perspective):
"What brings you in today? Tell me about this pain you're having. When did it start? What makes it worse?"

When the doctor asks good questions, "you go, 'Ah, this is a good doctor. I'm going to trust this.'"

## How to Apply It

**1. Shut the Laptop**

Literally don't open it at the start of meetings. You don't need slides or demos to have a diagnostic conversation.

**2. Open with the Problem**

Start every conversation the same way: "We're here because we've been working with some people in your industry and we understand there's this really serious problem around [X]. We believe that your company might have it—is that true?"

**3. Listen for the Real Problem**

Two possible responses:
- "Are you kidding me? OK, we have that problem..."
- "Well, not exactly..." (wait for it) "...what our real problem is..."

Either way, you've opened the door to their problem, not your solution.

**4. Collect Problem Domain Knowledge**

"The gold at this point is problem domain knowledge. That's the thing you really want to collect."

Take visible notes. Use a pen, not a laptop. Show you're listening.

**5. Commit to the Problem, Not the Product**

"We're going to take this problem off the table and we're not leaving until you're satisfied."

This is fundamentally different from "let me show you what our product can do."

## Why Discounting Doesn't Work

Discounting is a response to a weak compelling reason to buy:
- "Maybe if I lower the price, they'll decide"
- "Heart surgery 9.99 this Saturday only"

But discounting doesn't reduce risk—it might even increase it. "This vendor might say, 'Yeah, I'll give you a better price, but now I'm not going to give you the extra support.'"

When the compelling reason to buy is strong enough, customers pay full price for certainty.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Confusing interest for intent** - "They seemed really interested in the demo" doesn't mean they have a compelling reason to buy

2. **Making a sexier deck** - When deals stall, entrepreneurs try to improve their pitch instead of finding customers with more urgent pain

3. **Giving demos too early** - You haven't earned the right to demo until you've diagnosed their problem

4. **Talking about yourself** - In the bowling alley, "It's never about you... they don't want to talk to you about you. They want to talk to you about them."
