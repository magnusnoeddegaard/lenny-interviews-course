# Super Consumers

> "In most categories, roughly eight to 10% of the buyers are responsible for the vast majority of the profits. And more importantly, they are the zeitgeist. They are the thought leaders in the industry." — Christopher Lochhead

## What It Is

Super Consumers are the small percentage (typically 8-10%) of buyers in any category who are responsible for the vast majority of profits AND who define the category's standards. They're not just heavy users—they're the customers others look to as thought leaders, best practice exemplars, and taste-makers.

Super Consumers sit alongside your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) but add a crucial dimension: influence. While ICP focuses on who you can sell to profitably, Super Consumers are the subset who will also sell for you by shaping how the market thinks about your category.

## How It Works

**Super Consumers Are Different From Heavy Users**: Heavy users buy a lot. Super Consumers buy a lot AND:
- Set the zeitgeist for the category
- Are thought leaders others admire and aspire to be like
- Define "best practices" that others copy
- Have disproportionate influence on word of mouth

**The Economic Reality**: In most categories:
- 8-10% of buyers drive the vast majority of profits
- These same buyers shape how the rest of the market thinks
- Converting a Super Consumer yields both revenue AND influence

**Super Consumers in Category Design**: For category designers, Super Consumers serve a critical function:
- They're the first adopters of your new framing
- They put your words into other people's mouths
- They validate your category to the broader market
- They're where word of mouth starts

**Finding Super Consumers**: They're typically found:
- In native digital communities (Reddit, Discord, specialized forums)
- As speakers/attendees at industry events
- Writing content in your category
- Being referenced by others as exemplars

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify who your super consumers are**
   - Look beyond purchase volume to influence
   - Who do others in your market look up to?
   - Who defines "best practices" in your space?
   - Whose recommendations carry weight?

2. **Find where they congregate**
   - What digital communities are they active in?
   - What events do they attend?
   - What content do they consume?
   - Who do they follow?

3. **Lead with education, not selling**
   - Share your Point of View on the problem
   - Participate as an educator, not a vendor
   - Help them see the category differently

4. **Put the right words in the right mouths**
   - Give them language they can use to explain your category
   - Make your framing easy to repeat
   - Test that they can articulate your value proposition

5. **Optimize for their word of mouth**
   - Every interaction should be WOM-worthy
   - Ask: "Would they tell someone else about this?"
   - The goal is to turn them into evangelists

6. **Design lightning strikes around them**
   - Concentrate marketing effort where super consumers will see it
   - Make your moments unmissable for this audience
   - Let the broader market discover you through their influence

## When to Use It

Super Consumer thinking is valuable when:

- **Launching a new category** where you need influential early adopters
- **Resource-constrained marketing** where you can't reach everyone
- **Word of mouth is critical** to your growth model
- **Your product requires education** about a new problem or approach
- **Building credibility** in a market where trust matters

Super Consumer focus may be less relevant when:
- You're in a commodity market with no thought leadership
- Your product is purely transactional with no influence component
- You have unlimited marketing budget (though even then it's often still right)
- Super consumers don't exist in your category (rare)
