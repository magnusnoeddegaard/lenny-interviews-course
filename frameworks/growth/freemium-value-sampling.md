# Freemium Value Sampling

> "What if we actually sampled a number of different paid suggestions and interspersed them to free users across their writing? All of a sudden, people were seeing Grammarly as a much more powerful tool than they were before and our upgrade rates nearly doubled." - Albert Cheng

## What It Is

Freemium Value Sampling is a monetization strategy where free users experience a rotating sample of premium features integrated into their normal workflow, rather than being completely locked out of paid functionality. This shifts user perception from "this is a limited free product" to "this is a powerful product, and I'm getting a taste of everything it can do."

The key insight: If free users only experience free features, they perceive the product as limited. By strategically sampling premium features, you educate users on full product value while creating conversion triggers.

## How It Works

### Traditional Freemium (Problematic)
- Free users see only free features
- Premium features locked behind paywall
- User perceives product = free feature set
- Low understanding of premium value

### Value Sampling Approach
- Free users see a mix of free AND premium features
- Premium features are capped (e.g., 3 uses per day)
- User perceives product = full feature set with usage limits
- High understanding of premium value

### The Psychology
- It's a "reverse free trial but in real-time"
- Users experience value before hitting the limit
- Creates natural conversion moments ("I want more of THIS")
- Paywall appears at moments of demonstrated value

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your free experience** - What do free users actually see? If they only experience free features, they may think that IS your product.

2. **Identify high-value premium features** - Which paid features best demonstrate your full value proposition? Choose features that:
   - Are immediately understandable
   - Don't require learning curve
   - Provide obvious value
   - Can be capped without breaking workflows

3. **Intersperse, don't segregate** - Mix premium features into the normal workflow. In Grammarly's case: premium suggestions appeared alongside free suggestions while editing.

4. **Cap usage, not access** - Let users experience the feature, but limit frequency. "You've used 3 of 3 premium suggestions today" is more powerful than "Upgrade to see premium suggestions."

5. **Track the right events** - Instrument which premium features users engage with, how often they hit limits, and conversion rates from each feature sample.

6. **Make the best foot forward** - Your free product should reflect everything your product can offer, just with quantity limits.

## Example: Grammarly

**Before:** Free users got spelling and grammar corrections. Premium features (tone, clarity, rewrites) were completely hidden until upgrade.

**Problem:** Users perceived Grammarly as "just a spell checker" because that's all they experienced.

**After:** Free users saw a sample of premium suggestions interspersed with free ones. They got limited access to tone, clarity, and rewrite suggestions.

**Result:**
- Users perceived Grammarly as a powerful AI writing assistant
- Upgrade rates nearly doubled
- Brand perception shifted from "grammar tool" to "writing assistant"

## When to Use It

- Freemium products where free experience doesn't showcase full value
- Products where premium features can be capped by usage
- When users don't understand what they'd get by upgrading
- When your brand is being defined by free feature set

## When NOT to Use It

- If premium features have high marginal cost (compute-intensive)
- If sampling would break user workflows (incomplete functionality)
- If the premium feature requires setup/learning to demonstrate value
- B2B products where feature access is contractual
