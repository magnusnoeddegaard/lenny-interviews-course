# Growth Loop Model

> "Being able to identify the various micro and macro loops, how they're all connected, being able to document them in a qualitative model to communicate a shared understanding of how you grow, it's really powerful. Augmenting that then with the quantitative side of things that helps guide quarter to quarter focus and ensure you can be intentional about where you're investing, that becomes a big enabler." - Ben Williams

## What It Is

A comprehensive approach to mapping, connecting, and measuring the growth loops that drive your business. Rather than treating growth tactics in isolation, this framework creates a unified model that shows how multiple loops interact, identifies constraints, and guides investment decisions quarter to quarter.

The model has two components: a qualitative model that creates shared understanding of how you grow, and a quantitative layer that identifies constraints and guides prioritization.

## How It Works

### Qualitative Model
- Document each acquisition, activation, and retention loop
- Map micro loops (individual tactics) and macro loops (broader systems)
- Show how loops interconnect and reinforce each other
- Create shared vocabulary and understanding across teams

### Quantitative Layer
- Measure inputs and outputs of each loop
- Identify constraints and bottlenecks
- Track loop performance over time
- Guide quarter-to-quarter focus and investment

### Types of Loops (Snyk Examples)

**Company-Generated, Company-Distributed Content Loops**:
- Fixed pull requests: User connects GitHub → Snyk scans → Creates branded PR to fix vulnerabilities → Other devs see PR → Some sign up → Loop continues
- Snyk Advisor: Programmatic SEO pages for open source packages → Developers find via Google → Sign up for Snyk
- Security education: Free, bite-sized lessons → Developers learn → Convert to platform

**Referral and Invite Loops**:
- Users invite teammates
- Teams expand across organizations

## How to Apply It

1. **Map your existing loops** - Document every way new users currently discover your product. Include both intentional tactics and organic behaviors.

2. **Connect the loops** - Show how loops feed into each other. A content loop might create awareness that feeds a referral loop.

3. **Add quantitative measures** - For each loop, track: inputs (users entering), outputs (users continuing), conversion rates, and cycle time.

4. **Identify constraints** - Find where loops are bottlenecked. Is it low input volume? Poor conversion? Slow cycle time?

5. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - Focus investment on the biggest constraints. You'll never have a shortage of ideas—the model tells you where to focus.

6. **Layer new loops over time** - As constraints are relieved, add new loops. Expand successful loops (e.g., from GitHub to Bitbucket to GitLab).

7. **Revisit regularly** - Re-evaluate quarterly based on: learnings, broader company strategy, product evolution, and market shifts.

## When to Use It

- When founding or scaling a growth team
- During quarterly planning to prioritize focus areas
- When growth stalls and you need to diagnose why
- When deciding whether to expand existing loops or add new ones
- When communicating growth strategy to stakeholders
