# Fuel and Engine Framework

> "Forget the product marketing content partner, demand and growth, forget all of it, and just think of marketing as you need a fuel and you need an engine." - Emily Kramer

## What It Is

A simplifying mental model for understanding marketing that cuts through the complexity of marketing sub-functions. Instead of getting lost in titles like "product marketing," "content marketing," "demand gen," and "growth marketing," think of marketing as two essential components:

**Fuel** = The things you're creating—content, copy, positioning, stories, templates, tools, and anything that adds value to your audience.

**Engine** = How you get fuel out to the right people—distribution channels, email sequences, SEO mechanics, paid ads, and all the tracking and ops work that powers delivery.

Every marketing team needs both. The question is which one you're lacking.

## How It Works

### What Counts as Fuel
- Website copy and messaging
- Blog posts and long-form content
- Templates, calculators, and tools
- Webinar recordings and podcasts
- Positioning and messaging frameworks
- Product documentation
- Case studies and testimonials

### What Counts as Engine
- Email drip sequences and segmentation rules
- SEO technical setup and keyword strategy
- Paid advertising campaigns and targeting
- Social media distribution strategy
- Marketing ops (HubSpot, etc.)
- Attribution and tracking systems
- Lead scoring and handoff processes

### Things That Are Both Fuel AND Engine
- **Community**: Members create content (fuel) AND provide an audience to distribute to (engine)
- **Content with built-in distribution**: A viral tool that promotes itself
- **Product marketing**: Sets positioning (fuel) but also understands channels (engine)

## How to Apply It

1. **Diagnose your current state**: Ask yourself—what are your top-performing pieces of content? If you can't answer, you have a fuel problem. Ask—how are you distributing that content? If the answer is "we shared it on social and nothing happened," you have an engine problem.

2. **Match your first marketing hire to your gap**: If founders are already great at creating content and positioning, hire an engine person (growth/demand gen). If you have SDRs doing outbound but nothing valuable to put in those emails, hire a fuel person (content/product marketing).

3. **Avoid common mistakes**:
   - Building engine before fuel: Sending tons of outbound with nothing valuable to say
   - Building fuel without engine: Writing great blog posts that nobody ever sees
   - Activity goals instead of impact goals: "Write 10 blog posts" is not a goal—traffic and signups are

4. **Check balance regularly**: Marketing teams often drift toward one or the other. Great teams maintain balance—creating valuable content AND efficiently distributing it.

## When to Use It

- **Hiring your first marketer**: Determine whether you need a fuel person or an engine person
- **Diagnosing why marketing isn't working**: Is the content bad, or is nobody seeing it?
- **Planning marketing strategy**: Ensure you're investing in both sides
- **Evaluating marketing team effectiveness**: Are they building both fuel and engine?
