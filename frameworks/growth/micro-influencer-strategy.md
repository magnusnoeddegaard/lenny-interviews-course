# Micro-Influencer Strategy

> "You're much better doing the hard thing, which is hard to scale, but it's finding the thousands of micro influencers that have an audience where your product maybe is actually useful. People really trust what they say. That ends up becoming this wildfire that can spread really, really fast." - Grant Lee

## What It Is

The Micro-Influencer Strategy inverts the typical influencer marketing playbook. Instead of spending big budgets on a few famous creators with millions of followers, invest in hundreds or thousands of smaller creators whose audiences genuinely trust them and whose use cases align with your product.

Grant Lee describes how Gamma's approach worked: rather than giving big influencers scripts to read (which "immediately feels like an ad"), they found educators, consultants, and other professionals whose actual work involved creating presentations. These creators talked about Gamma in their voice because they actually used it.

The result: influencer marketing became an amplifier for word-of-mouth. Every dollar spent on micro-influencers generated an additional 1.5x in organic referrals.

## How It Works

**1. Echo Chamber Dynamics**
Find pockets of users who talk to each other. Teachers talk to teachers. Consultants talk to consultants. When a trusted member of these communities recommends something, it spreads within the echo chamber.

**2. Authenticity Over Reach**
Micro-influencers are often deeply trusted by their small audiences. A recommendation from them feels like advice from a friend, not an advertisement. This trust comes from Dunbar's number—influencers work to feel like they're in your network.

**3. Power Law Distribution**
90% of reach comes from less than 10% of influencers. You can't predict which ones will break through, so cast a wide net and double down on what works.

## How to Apply It

### Founder Involvement (Critical Early Step)
1. **Onboard influencers personally** - Jump on calls with each one so they truly understand your product
2. **Help them tell your story in their voice** - Don't give scripts; give context
3. **Make them feel like an extension of your team** - They'll sense if you're just treating them as a transaction

### Scaling the Program
4. **Start with 20-30 creators per month** at $10-20K/month budget
5. **Find niche echo chambers** - Educators, consultants, specific industries where your product fits
6. **Use platforms to scale** - 1stCollab (YC company) automates outbound and persona matching
7. **Work with hungry agencies** - Small, young agencies native to social media (e.g., AKG Media)

### Optimizing Over Time
8. **Track what works** - Which personas, which hooks, which platforms
9. **Double down** - When educators work, find more educators
10. **Open-source your brand** - Gamma has brand.gamma.app with all assets, voice/tone guides, even Midjourney prompts

### Platform Selection
- **LinkedIn**: 4-5x higher conversion rates than other platforms—still underutilized
- **TikTok**: No minimum audience needed; algorithm rewards engaging content from new accounts
- **Twitter**: Good for technical/tactical content but lower conversion for some products

## The Math

- Budget: $10-20K/month
- Creators: 20-50 per month (few hundred to low thousands per creator)
- Timeline: 6+ months minimum to see compounding effects
- Ratio: 90% of reach from <10% of creators

## Common Mistakes

**Putting all eggs in one basket**
Spending $20K on one big influencer instead of 40 micro-influencers

**Giving scripts**
"Immediately feels like an ad" and the product isn't connected to the creator

**Starting too small**
A few creators per month won't generate enough signal

**Expecting quick results**
This is a compounding game—it takes months to find winning formulas

## Echo Chambers to Target

Find communities where:
- Members talk to each other regularly
- Your product solves a real problem they face
- Trusted voices have disproportionate influence

Examples for Gamma: educators, consultants, sales teams, startup founders

## When to Use It

- **Post-PMF**: When word-of-mouth is already working (influencers amplify it)
- **Prosumer/B2C products**: Where community dynamics matter
- **Products with shareable outputs**: Things people naturally show others
- **When paid ads have high CAC**: Influencer can be more efficient
