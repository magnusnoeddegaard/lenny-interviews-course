# Top-of-Funnel vs Mid-Funnel SEO

> "Up until AI Overviews, whoever won on that long form piece of content would get that first click. But now that doesn't exist anymore." - Eli Schwartz

## What It Is

This framework distinguishes between two types of SEO based on where users are in their buyer journey. With AI Overviews and LLMs now providing direct answers to exploratory queries, the traditional top-of-funnel SEO play is being disrupted. The opportunity has shifted to mid-funnel SEO where users have intent and are ready to take action.

**Top-of-Funnel SEO**: Users are curious and exploring. They search broad queries like "best beach vacation" or "what is a CRM." AI can now answer these directly—no click required.

**Mid-Funnel SEO**: Users have direction and intent. They search specific queries like "Cancun hotel reviews" or "Salesforce pricing." They need to take action, and AI can't do that for them.

## How It Works

**The Funnel Shift:**

1. **Top-of-Funnel (Disrupted by AI)**: Users don't know what they want. They're researching and comparing options. AI Overviews now synthesize this information instantly. Sites like G2, Capterra, WebMD, and generic "best X" content are most vulnerable.

2. **Mid-Funnel (SEO Opportunity)**: Users know what direction they're going. They're evaluating specific options. They need to take action—book a hotel, download an app, buy a product. AI can inform but not execute.

3. **Bottom-of-Funnel (Conversion)**: Users are ready to buy. They search brand + pricing, brand + reviews, brand + specific features. This is where conversions happen.

**Why Mid-Funnel Wins:**

- Users have intent (they want to do something, not just learn something)
- AI can't take action for them (they still need to click, sign up, or buy)
- Fewer competitors (most SEO focuses on top-of-funnel rankings)
- Higher conversion (closer to purchase decision)

## How to Apply It

1. **Map your buyer journey**: Identify what questions users ask at each stage—from "what is X" (top) to "how much does X cost" (bottom).

2. **Focus on intent-driven searches**: Target queries where the user wants to DO something, not just LEARN something. "Hotels in Cancun" beats "best beach vacations."

3. **Let AI handle top-of-funnel**: Don't fight AI Overviews for informational queries. Accept that Google will summarize "what is a CRM" and focus downstream.

4. **Build for the mid-funnel user**: Create content and products that help users who already know what direction they're going. They need help evaluating, not discovering.

5. **Connect to conversion**: Ensure every mid-funnel SEO asset has a clear path to your monetization. The user is ready to act—make it easy.

## When to Use It

**Shift to mid-funnel when:**

- Your top-of-funnel content is losing traffic to AI Overviews
- You're ranking well but not converting
- You're competing against aggregators and content farms at the top
- Your product solves a specific problem users search for directly

**Top-of-funnel may still work for:**

- Building brand awareness (if you're mentioned in AI answers)
- Capturing users who then search for you directly
- Categories where AI answers don't exist yet

## Examples

**Travel Industry:**

- Top-of-funnel (disrupted): "Best beach vacation within 2 hours of US" → AI gives you the answer
- Mid-funnel (opportunity): "Cancun hotel reviews" → User needs to actually book
- Bottom-funnel (conversion): "Marriott Cancun price" → Ready to purchase

**SaaS/Software:**

- Top-of-funnel (disrupted): "Best CRM tools" → AI lists the top options
- Mid-funnel (opportunity): "Salesforce vs HubSpot" → User is evaluating
- Bottom-funnel (conversion): "HubSpot free trial" → Ready to act

**Tinder Example:**

- Top-of-funnel: "How to meet people in a new city" → AI can answer this
- Mid-funnel: "Online dating in Dubai" → User needs to solve loneliness
- The mid-funnel query leads directly to action (downloading Tinder)
