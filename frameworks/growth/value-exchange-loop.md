# Value Exchange Loop

> "The organization is trying to deliver as much value as it can to the market and to capture as much value back, and by creating a feedback loop between these two you are actually able to grow very fast." - Itamar Gilad

## What It Is

The Value Exchange Loop is a model for understanding how successful companies grow by optimizing two distinct but connected sides of their business: the value they deliver to users and the value they capture back. Rather than having siloed departmental goals (engineering goals, design goals, marketing goals), evidence-guided companies create overarching goals centered on this value exchange.

The insight is that these two sides form a feedback loop - the more value you deliver, the more value you can capture, which funds delivering even more value. Focusing on just one side (pure growth hacking or pure user value without monetization) breaks the loop.

## How It Works

**Value Delivered (North Star Metric)**
Measure how much core value you're creating for users. This should capture the fundamental unit of value your product delivers:
- WhatsApp: Messages sent (each message = incremental value for sender and receiver)
- Airbnb: Nights booked (each night = successful value exchange between host and guest)
- Amplitude: Weekly active learning users (users who found insights valuable enough to share)

The key question: If this metric doubles, have we doubled the value we're delivering to the world?

**Value Captured (Top Business KPI)**
Measure what you get back from delivering value - typically revenue, profit, or market share. This is the fuel that lets you continue investing in delivering more value.

**The Loop**
When both metrics grow together, you have a healthy value exchange loop:
1. Deliver more value → Users get more benefit → They're willing to pay more/use more
2. Capture more value → More resources to invest → Can deliver even more value
3. Repeat

When they diverge, something is broken:
- High value delivered but low capture = unsustainable, poor monetization
- High value captured but declining delivery = extractive, users will leave

## How to Apply It

1. **Define your North Star Metric**: What is the single best measure of value delivered to users? It should be:
   - Quantifiable and trackable
   - Directly connected to user benefit
   - Something that, if it doubles, clearly indicates double the value delivered

2. **Define your Top Business KPI**: What value are you capturing? Usually revenue or a leading indicator of revenue.

3. **Build metrics trees for both**: Break each metric down into its component parts. Find where the trees overlap - these intersection metrics are often your highest-leverage opportunities.

4. **Use both for decision-making**: When evaluating ideas, ask: Does this improve value delivered? Does it improve value captured? The best ideas improve both or significantly improve one without harming the other.

5. **Create alignment**: When teams disagree on priorities, bring it back to the loop. Team A's idea might improve the North Star; Team B's might improve revenue. The loop shows how they're connected, not competing.

## When to Use It

- **Goal-setting**: Establishing company and team OKRs around meaningful outcomes
- **Strategy debates**: Resolving arguments between "user value" advocates and "business value" advocates
- **Prioritization**: Evaluating ideas based on their impact on the loop
- **Team alignment**: Helping different functions see how their work connects
- **Investment decisions**: Ensuring resources go to initiatives that strengthen the loop
