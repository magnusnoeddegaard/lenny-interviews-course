# Technology Adoption Lifecycle

> "You can be a visionary with some things, a pragmatist with other things, and a conservative with other things. So the way to really think about them is, what is my persona in relation to this decision?" - Geoffrey Moore

## What It Is

The Technology Adoption Lifecycle is a model describing how different customer segments adopt new technologies over time. Originally based on research by Everett Rogers and refined by Geoffrey Moore, it divides customers into five distinct groups that have fundamentally different motivations, risk tolerances, and buying behaviors.

Understanding where your customers sit on this lifecycle is critical because each segment requires a completely different go-to-market approach. Using the wrong playbook for the wrong segment will slow you down or cause you to fail.

## How It Works

**The Five Segments**

1. **Technology Enthusiasts (Innovators)** - ~2.5% of market
   - Want to explore new technology for its own sake
   - Will accept bugs and incomplete products
   - Provide early feedback but won't reference well

2. **Visionaries (Early Adopters)** - ~13.5% of market
   - Want to be ahead of the competition
   - See strategic advantage in new technology
   - Make their own decisions, don't consult peers
   - "We believe what you believe"

3. **Pragmatists (Early Majority)** - ~34% of market
   - Want proven solutions to pressing problems
   - Consult peers before making risky purchases
   - "We need what you have"
   - This is where the money is

4. **Conservatives (Late Majority)** - ~34% of market
   - Want complete, reliable solutions
   - Buy only when something becomes standard
   - Price-sensitive, risk-averse

5. **Skeptics (Laggards)** - ~16% of market
   - Actively resist new technology
   - Only adopt when forced to
   - Not a viable market segment

**Key Insight: Buying Behavior Differs**

The critical distinction is between visionaries and pragmatists:

- **Visionaries** make their own decisions and don't consult peers. If their peers are doing it, they probably won't—they want to be different.

- **Pragmatists** need references and will only buy what they see their peers buying. "If peer one is buying product A, and peer two is B and C and D, there's no market leader, and the category goes sideways."

## The Chasm

Between visionaries and pragmatists lies a gap called "the chasm"—the most dangerous point in a company's growth.

**Why the Chasm Exists:**

Pragmatists need references, but:
- They won't accept visionaries as references (visionaries are too different, too risky)
- They don't have any pragmatist peers who've tried it yet
- It's like the "junior high dance problem"—nobody wants to go first

**Many promising companies die in the chasm** because they mistake visionary success for mainstream traction.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your current segment** - Are your best customers visionaries or pragmatists? What's their buying motivation?

2. **Match your playbook to your segment:**
   - Early Market (visionaries) → Project model, vision-selling
   - Bowling Alley (early pragmatists) → Solution model, problem-selling
   - Tornado (mainstream pragmatists) → Product model, market share land grab
   - Main Street (conservatives) → Service model, expansion and optimization

3. **Recognize transitions** - When you've exhausted one segment, you need to switch playbooks for the next. The skills that won visionaries won't win pragmatists.

4. **Don't use visionary references for pragmatists** - Pragmatists look at visionaries with wariness, often because they've had to clean up messes visionaries left behind.

## When to Use It

- **Go-to-market strategy** - Choosing the right sales and marketing approach for your stage
- **Customer segmentation** - Understanding why different customers respond differently
- **Revenue forecasting** - Recognizing which segments represent sustainable business
- **Team building** - Hiring salespeople with skills appropriate to your stage

## Common Mistakes

- **Believing visionary success means mainstream traction** - "We have Apple as a customer!" doesn't mean pragmatists will follow
- **Using one playbook for all segments** - Qualifying on budget works for the tornado, but kills you in the early market
- **Thinking you can skip segments** - You can't jump from visionaries to conservatives
