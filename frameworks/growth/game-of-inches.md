# Growth is a Game of Inches

> "Sometimes we think it's like what is the huge step function? But actually most companies are like... if you can move things 1% a little bit faster every single week, think about the amount of growth you get at the end. It's not just, 'Okay, what's going to get you the 3X?' You can get to 3X 1% at a time, 5% at a time." - Deb Liu

## What It Is

Growth is a Game of Inches challenges the myth that growth comes from finding a silver bullet or magic hack. Instead, sustainable growth comes from relentlessly optimizing small things that compound over time.

The framework treats growth as an optimization engine rather than a treasure hunt. Rather than searching for the one big lever, successful growth teams maintain lists of 100+ hypotheses, work through them systematically, and accept that 80% won't work. The ones that do work compound into massive results.

Deb Liu's experience at Facebook—where even small changes like adding "create an ad" text next to ads drove significant growth—demonstrates that the "small things" are often hiding in plain sight.

## How It Works

**The Math of Compounding:**
- 1% improvement weekly = 68% improvement annually
- Small changes × high volume = large impact
- 20% success rate × 20 experiments = 4 wins (same output as 100% rate × 4 experiments, with more learning)

**The Optimization Engine Approach:**

1. **Maintain a hypothesis list** - Keep 100+ ideas for potential improvements
2. **Batch and prioritize** - Select the top 10 to work on in a sprint
3. **Ship and measure** - Test quickly with clear success criteria
4. **Learn and iterate** - Use failures to inform new hypotheses
5. **Repeat continuously** - Work through 10 more, then 10 more

**Common "Inches" That Drive Growth:**
- Button placement and labeling
- Flow reduction (fewer steps to value)
- Copy and messaging tweaks
- Default settings optimization
- Timing of notifications
- Friction removal in key paths

## How to Apply It

1. **Reframe growth expectations** - Stop looking for silver bullets; commit to systematic optimization

2. **Build an experiment backlog** - Create a living list of 100+ hypotheses; never run out of ideas to test

3. **Accept high failure rates** - If 80% of experiments fail but you're shipping 20, you still get 4 wins. A team that only ships 4 "sure things" doesn't outperform you, and you've learned more.

4. **Optimize for iteration speed** - A team that ships 20 experiments with 20% success beats a team that ships 4 with 100% success—same output, more learning

5. **Focus on aha moments** - Product-led growth means finding and amplifying the small moments where users discover value

6. **Treat growth as product marketing** - Growth wraps around a core product, making it more accessible and usable through small optimizations

## When to Use It

- When the team is paralyzed searching for "the big idea"
- Building a growth culture in a product organization
- Evaluating growth team performance
- Deciding between incremental optimization and big bets
- When stakeholders expect overnight transformation
