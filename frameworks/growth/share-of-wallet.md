# Share of Wallet

> "If you could tell me we could grow GMV 10% by getting 10% more customers or by getting 10% more of our current customers' wallet, I would take the latter because you now have a deeper relationship with them." - Dan Hockenmaier

## What It Is

Share of wallet measures how much of a customer's total spend in your category goes to you versus alternatives. It applies to both sides of a marketplace:

- **Buyer side**: What percentage of their total category spend comes through your platform?
- **Seller side**: What percentage of their business revenue comes through you?

This metric matters more than raw volume because it indicates relationship depth and predicts future retention and defensibility.

## How It Works

### Measuring Share of Wallet

**For Buyers:**
- Faire example: If a retailer stocks their store with products, what percentage of their shelf came from Faire versus other wholesalers?
- Uber example: If a rider takes 20 trips per month, how many are on Uber vs Lyft vs other services?

**For Sellers:**
- Uber drivers: If they spend 40 hours driving per week, how many hours are on your platform vs competitors?
- Marketplace sellers: What percentage of their total sales comes through your marketplace?

### Why Depth Beats Breadth

Higher share of wallet delivers three advantages:

1. **Higher LTVs**: More spend = more revenue per customer
2. **Less multi-tenanting**: Customers consolidate to fewer platforms
3. **Stronger defensibility**: Harder for competitors to displace you

### The Multi-Tenant Risk

When share of wallet is low, customers easily use multiple services simultaneously. A driver who does 10 hours/week on each of three platforms has no loyalty. A driver doing 40 hours/week on one platform is committed.

## How to Apply It

1. **Define the Total Market**
   - Identify what "total spend" means for your customers
   - Be specific about the category boundaries

2. **Measure Current Share**
   - Survey customers about total spend
   - Use data proxies where possible
   - Track changes over time by cohort

3. **Choose Your Leverage Point**
   - You often can't drive high share of wallet on both sides simultaneously
   - Decide which side to prioritize based on where you can win

4. **Build Features That Increase Share**
   - Make your platform the path of least resistance
   - Create switching costs through better service, not artificial barriers
   - Solve more of the customer's adjacent problems

## When to Use It

- **Marketplace health assessment**: Beyond GMV, how deep are your relationships?
- **Competitive positioning**: Are you the primary platform or one of many?
- **Growth strategy**: Should you focus on more customers or more from existing customers?
- **Retention analysis**: Higher share of wallet typically predicts better retention

## Key Insight: Depth Over Breadth

> "Share of wallet is basically a measure of depth rather than breadth. And I will take depth every time in a marketplace."

The temptation is always to chase new customers. But 10% more wallet from existing customers often creates more value than 10% more customers because:
- It signals stronger product-market fit
- It increases switching costs
- It compounds through better retention
- It reduces multi-tenanting

## Cautions

- **B2B vs Consumer**: Share of wallet is cleaner to measure in B2B where spend is tracked. Consumer marketplaces may need proxies.
- **Supply side always measurable**: Even consumer marketplaces typically have business-like entities on supply that can be measured.
- **Don't optimize share at expense of market size**: Growing share in a shrinking market isn't winning.
