# Microapps Strategy

> "One of the first microapps we ever built was Website Grader. You put in your domain, and it crawled your site, and then gave you a set of recommendations for how you would optimize your site. And it was free. It was definitely a one trick pony. But what it did was it created an interesting conversation." - Christopher Miller

## What It Is

Microapps are small, standalone tools that solve a specific problem for free while creating a natural conversation about your core product. They represent an evolution of content marketing - instead of ebooks and whitepapers, you provide functional tools that deliver immediate value.

HubSpot pioneered this approach with Website Grader, a free tool that analyzed websites and provided optimization recommendations. The tool creates a natural handoff: "Now that you know what to fix, here's how HubSpot can help you fix it."

## How It Works

Microapps follow a specific structure:

1. **Single-purpose utility**: Solves one specific, valuable problem
2. **Instant gratification**: Delivers value immediately with minimal friction
3. **Natural conversation starter**: Output creates awareness of problems your product solves
4. **Lead capture**: Exchange value for contact information or product signup
5. **Standalone distribution**: Can spread independently of your main product

### HubSpot's Microapp Examples
- **Website Grader**: Analyzes site and recommends improvements
- **Brand Kit Generator**: Creates brand assets instantly
- **Email Signature Generator**: Builds professional signatures
- **Build My Persona**: Creates buyer personas
- **ChatSpot**: AI copilot for business tasks

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify adjacent pain points** - What problems do your customers face before needing your product?
2. **Design for virality** - Make outputs shareable or the tool referrable
3. **Keep it simple** - One trick pony is the goal, not a mini version of your product
4. **Create the conversation** - Output should naturally lead to "and here's how to fix this"
5. **Track the funnel** - Measure from microapp usage to product signup to paid conversion
6. **Experiment liberally** - "Some will be successes, some will flop, and we'll probably sunset them"

### Design Criteria
- **Time to value**: Under 60 seconds to get useful output
- **Input simplicity**: Minimal friction to start (URL, email, basic info)
- **Output value**: Genuinely useful even if user never buys
- **Product connection**: Clear path to core product value

## When to Use It

Microapps work well when:

- **Diversifying channels**: You're over-reliant on one acquisition channel
- **SEO is threatened**: AI and algorithm changes make content marketing riskier
- **Category education needed**: Customers don't yet know they have the problem
- **Freemium has limits**: Your core product can't be fully self-service
- **Competition for attention**: Content saturation makes differentiation hard

**Consider carefully if**:
- Your core product can serve as its own acquisition tool
- Microapp would cannibalize core product value
- You lack engineering resources to build and maintain tools
