# Modular PLG Approach

> "I don't actually think that [PLG and self-service] are one and the same. Most companies, at least the larger, more successful ones that we would consider to be PLG companies have a bunch of humans working on really important things on their go-to-market, and it's more of a hybrid motion." - Christopher Miller

## What It Is

The Modular PLG Approach challenges the assumption that being "product-led" means being fully self-service. Instead, it provides a framework for determining where in the customer journey product-led approaches make sense versus where human involvement is optimal.

Miller argues that most successful PLG companies use a hybrid motion. The question isn't "PLG or sales?" but "Where in the customer journey should each approach dominate?" This pragmatic view recognizes that different customers, products, and moments require different approaches.

## How It Works

Evaluate each stage of the customer journey using these diagnostic questions:

### Market & Product Factors
- **Buyer familiarity**: How comfortable is your target market with your category?
- **Competition source**: Are you competing against non-consumption or direct competitors?
- **Product complexity**: Is it self-evident or does it require explanation/training?
- **Decision dynamics**: Is it a top-down or bottom-up decision?

### Purchase & Activation Factors
- **Transaction complexity**: Is it highly considered or transactional?
- **Data migration**: Is there significant switching cost/complexity?
- **Security/compliance**: Do buyers need human assurance on these topics?
- **Who decides**: Is the buyer also the end user?

### Answers Guide Approach
- **Favorable to PLG**: Digital natives, bottom-up, low migration burden, transactional
- **Favor human involvement**: Complex compliance, large data migrations, considered purchases

## How to Apply It

1. **Map your customer journey** - Break it into distinct stages (discover, evaluate, activate, purchase, expand)
2. **Score each stage** - For each stage, evaluate the conditions using the diagnostic questions above
3. **Design the handoffs** - Determine where product leads vs. humans lead, and how transitions happen
4. **Avoid forcing pure PLG** - If conditions don't favor self-service at a stage, use humans as the primary motion
5. **Iterate by segment** - Different customer segments may need different journey designs
6. **Don't create turf wars** - Growth teams sending leads to sales should be celebrated, not avoided

### Example: HubSpot's Modular Approach
- **Discovery & Evaluation**: Product-led (free product, self-service exploration)
- **Activation**: Product-led for small businesses, human-assisted for mid-market
- **Purchase**: Self-service for transactional, sales-assisted for considered/complex
- **Expansion**: Mix depending on deal size and customer sophistication

## When to Use It

Use this framework when:

- **Planning PLG strategy**: To identify where to invest in self-service vs. sales
- **Scaling a growth team**: To understand the relationship between growth and sales
- **Debating "how PLG" to be**: To move past ideological positions to pragmatic decisions
- **Diagnosing conversion problems**: To identify where human vs. product intervention is needed
- **Serving multiple segments**: To design different journeys for different customer types
