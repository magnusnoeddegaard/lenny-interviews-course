# PLG Commitment Test

> "The red flags I've seen basically sometimes, first of all, they think about PLG equals launch of free version or launch of free trial. They made this assumption in their head, 'Oh, I already have a product. I already have a software that's working, customers are using. Now if I add a free version, if I open a free trial, that's it.' Like that's basically PLG, and I will have conversions... The other one is they don't have a dedicated team. They just basically assign one person to the thing... That person need to be a magician in order to be successful in that basically." - Hila Qu

## What It Is

The PLG Commitment Test is a diagnostic framework for evaluating whether a company is truly prepared to invest in product-led growth, or if they're just following a trend without the commitment required for success.

Many companies fail at PLG not because the model doesn't fit their business, but because they underestimate the level of commitment required. PLG is an entire motion that requires dedicated resources, organizational change, and at least a 1-2 year roadmap - not just adding a "Start Free Trial" button.

## How It Works

### Red Flags: Signs of Insufficient Commitment

**Red Flag #1: "Free Trial = PLG" Mindset**
- Belief that launching a free version is the complete PLG strategy
- Expecting conversions to happen automatically once free access exists
- No plan for activation, upgrade paths, or team collaboration

**Red Flag #2: No Dedicated Team**
- Assigning one person to "figure out PLG" by borrowing resources
- Expecting existing teams to add PLG work to their current responsibilities
- No growth PM or dedicated engineering resources

**Red Flag #3: Following the Trend**
- Pursuing PLG because "everyone is doing it" or "it's the future"
- No deep thinking about strategic fit with the business
- No analysis of whether the product characteristics support PLG

**Red Flag #4: Missing Foundation**
- No product usage data or analytics infrastructure
- No understanding of user behavior patterns
- No expertise in PLG/growth experimentation

### Green Flags: Signs of True Commitment

**Committed Timeline**
- Minimum 1-2 year roadmap for building PLG motion
- Understanding that results won't be immediate

**Dedicated Resources**
- Growth PM or Head of Growth hired/assigned
- Dedicated engineering and design resources
- Data analyst support

**Strategic Clarity**
- Clear reasoning for why PLG fits the business
- Understanding of target user segments
- Defined success metrics

**Foundation Investment**
- Willingness to invest in data infrastructure
- Plan for analytics and experimentation tools
- Expertise acquisition (hiring or advisory)

## How to Apply It

**For Leaders Considering PLG:**

1. **Assess strategic fit** - Does your product have:
   - Relatively low complexity?
   - Quick time to value (or can you create one)?
   - Target market of end users who can try before buying?
   - Price point that supports self-serve purchase?

2. **Check for red flags** - Are you treating PLG as:
   - Just adding a free trial?
   - A side project for existing teams?
   - Something you're doing because it's trendy?

3. **Plan the commitment** - Are you ready to:
   - Dedicate resources for 1-2 years?
   - Hire or assign a growth PM?
   - Invest in data infrastructure?
   - Change processes across sales, marketing, and product?

4. **Build conviction first** - Before committing:
   - Collect data on user behavior
   - Run small experiments
   - Bring in expertise through advisors if needed

## When to Use It

- When deciding whether to pursue PLG
- When evaluating why a PLG initiative is struggling
- When assessing organizational readiness for PLG
- When building the business case for PLG investment
- When coaching executives on PLG requirements
