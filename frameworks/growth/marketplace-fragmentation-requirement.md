# Marketplace Fragmentation Requirement

> "The more concentrated either side of your market is, the more leverage they have, the less likely they are to need you and the less likely they are to be willing to pay a high commission." - Dan Hockenmaier

## What It Is

For a marketplace to work, both sides need to be fragmented—many small participants rather than a few large players. When markets are concentrated, large players don't need a marketplace because they can:
- Have their own sales/procurement teams
- Negotiate directly with counterparties
- Build internal operations that bypass the platform

This is why many B2B marketplaces fail despite large TAMs.

## How It Works

### What Fragmentation Means

**Fragmented:** Many businesses share the transaction volume
- Thousands of small restaurants need DoorDash
- Millions of hosts need Airbnb
- Local services pros need Thumbtack

**Concentrated:** Few players control most volume
- If 10 companies do 80% of transactions
- Those players have in-house capabilities
- They don't need your platform

### Why Concentration Breaks Marketplaces

**1. They Don't Need You**
Large players have:
- Internal sales teams
- Established customer relationships
- Procurement departments
- In-house logistics

They've already solved the problem you're trying to solve.

**2. They Won't Pay Your Commission**
Even if you provide value:
- They have negotiating leverage
- They can demand lower rates
- They'll disintermediate on large deals

**3. Disintermediation Risk**
Higher dollar value per transaction = higher incentive to go around you.

### The Dollar Threshold

> "One principle to use here is how many total dollars are attached to each transaction in the marketplace. When it goes above a certain amount, it becomes much more attractive to figure out how to go around the marketplace."

Example thresholds:
- **Low risk:** $2-3 Uber ride commission
- **Medium risk:** $50-100 food delivery
- **High risk:** $10,000+ B2B materials order

At high values, the commission saved justifies the effort to disintermediate.

## How to Apply It

1. **Measure Market Fragmentation**
   - What percentage of volume do the top 5-10% of players control?
   - How many total participants exist on each side?

2. **Assess "Need" Level**
   - Do the largest players have internal capabilities?
   - Could they survive without your platform?

3. **Calculate Disintermediation Risk**
   - What's the average transaction value?
   - What's your commission in absolute dollars?
   - Is that enough to motivate working around you?

4. **Find the Fragmented Segment**
   - Even in concentrated industries, there may be fragmented niches
   - The long tail may need you even if the head doesn't

## When B2B Marketplaces Work

Despite concentration challenges, B2B marketplaces can succeed when:

**1. Genuine Fragmentation Exists**
- Faire: Independent brands and local retailers (both fragmented)
- Convoy trucking: Small carriers and shippers

**2. Trust/Credit Problems**
- Platforms that underwrite transactions add unique value
- Large players may use platforms for risk management

**3. Discovery Challenge**
- Even large buyers may struggle to find specialized suppliers
- The matching problem persists regardless of size

## Why Fewer B2B Marketplaces Exist

> "Part of the reason we've seen fewer is there are fewer potential founders who understand B2B problems because most of them are consumers and so the consumer use cases are more obvious."

Plus:
- B2B markets often have lower fragmentation
- Discovery takes longer for founders
- Unit economics are harder to make work

## Example: Materials Marketplace

> "There's a bunch of people in the kind of material space within B2B marketplaces, you have manufacturers of say beauty products who need to source aerosol cans...There's not that many of these big suppliers and each of their transactions may be tens of thousands of dollars, hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars."

Why it fails:
- Concentrated supply (few aerosol manufacturers)
- High transaction values
- Easy to pick up the phone and save $50,000
