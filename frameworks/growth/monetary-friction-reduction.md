# Monetary Friction Reduction

> "If I give you a little monetary boost and reduce that monetary friction, I can actually causally change your ability to become successful, because I've given you a little bit more time to try that idea a little bit longer. I've given you that opportunity to move your business over to Shopify." - Archie Abrams

## What It Is

Monetary Friction Reduction is a growth strategy that systematically lowers financial barriers to entry—through trial extensions, incentives, credits, and pricing—not merely as a discount tactic, but as a way to causally enable users who would otherwise fail.

The conventional wisdom says discounts attract low-quality users. The counterintuitive insight: in many businesses, reducing monetary friction actually *unlocks* a class of high-potential users who would have given up due to resource constraints, not lack of commitment.

## How It Works

**Forms of monetary friction:**
1. **Trial dynamics** - Length, structure, and conditions of free trials
2. **Incentives** - Credits, app store credits, promotional offers
3. **Price points** - The actual subscription or transaction costs

**The causal mechanism:**
- Bootstrapped entrepreneur has a promising idea
- $39/month feels significant when there's no revenue yet
- Without relief, they might give up after 2 weeks
- With reduced friction, they have time to get their first sale
- That first sale creates momentum that compounds
- Long-term, these users are among your most valuable

**Why it works differently than "discounting":**
- Traditional discount: Attracts price-sensitive users who are less valuable
- Monetary friction reduction: Gives potential winners the runway they need
- The difference is *why* the user needs help—resource constraints vs. low commitment

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify friction points** - Where do promising users drop off due to cost, not commitment?

2. **Design experiments thoughtfully** - Test reduced friction with long-term holdouts (short-term metrics may be misleading)

3. **Think causally** - Ask "Does this change what users can accomplish?" not just "Does this attract more users?"

4. **Match friction to user journey** - Early-stage users may need more help than established ones

5. **Monitor long-term cohort value** - The true value of friction reduction often only appears at 6-12+ months

## When to Use It

- When users face legitimate resource constraints (not just price sensitivity)
- When user success requires time to prove out (product-market fit, building audience, etc.)
- When you have power-law economics where big winners compensate for losses
- When short-term metrics like trial conversion might be misleading
- When your business captures value downstream (payments, transactions) rather than upfront

## Example: Long-Term Wins from Friction Reduction

"In those types of experiments you see that you've basically unlocked a class of people who might've given up without reducing that monetary friction."

Shopify found that when they reduced monetary barriers:
- Short-term, conventional quality signals looked worse
- But long-term cohort GMV often improved
- Because some users just needed more time, not less commitment
- And those users became successful merchants who drove platform value

This is why Shopify monitors experiments at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months—the true signal takes time to emerge.

## The Udemy Lesson

Archie's experience at Udemy showed another angle on monetary friction:

"Discounting has a really powerful effect... it can signal value with a high list price, but then bring something down to an affordable price."

For online courses, the list price ($100) signaled college-course quality, while the discount price ($10) matched what people would actually pay (book-level). The urgency and accessibility enabled the emotional "progress" job-to-be-done—purchasing became a form of self-improvement.
