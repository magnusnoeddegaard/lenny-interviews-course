# PLG Bundling Anti-Pattern

> "Specifically for product led growth companies, bundling is not a great land strategy... If you have to evaluate multiple products to purchase something, it's not a fast and easy online self-service buy." - Carilu Dietrich

## What It Is

A counterintuitive insight from Atlassian's experimentation: while bundling is a powerful growth strategy for sales-led motions, it actively hurts product-led growth acquisition.

The core insight is that PLG's power comes from speed and simplicity. A single product with a clear value proposition enables rapid self-service adoption. Bundling introduces cognitive load that slows down the buying decision—and in PLG, friction kills conversion.

## How It Works

### Why Bundles Work for Sales-Led

In a sales-led motion, bundles work because:
- A salesperson guides evaluation of multiple products
- CFOs can negotiate volume discounts
- The buying process is already complex and multi-week
- "Land and expand" means selling more things to existing customers who trust you

### Why Bundles Kill PLG Land

In product-led growth, bundles fail because:
- Self-service requires fast, simple evaluation
- Each additional product multiplies decision complexity
- Users ask: "Do I need all three? Can I use just one? Are they all good?"
- Seven-day time-to-purchase becomes multiple weeks
- Every extra day of evaluation = lost conversions

### The Atlassian Evidence

Atlassian experimented with bundled land strategies combining products like:
- Jira (issue tracking) + Confluence (wiki) + HipChat (messaging)
- Jira + Bitbucket + Confluence (engineering suite)

The result: "It really slowed down the product led growth motion. So we ended up going back to land with a single product."

The evaluation process shifted from: "I need issue tracking, Jira looks good, let me try it" to "Do I need all three products? Can I break them apart? Do they all work? Are each of them best of breed?"

### The Right Pattern

**Land**: Single product, high velocity
- One person uses it
- They get value quickly
- They're ready to buy in days, not weeks

**Expand**: Bundles for existing customers
- They already trust you
- They've experienced the product quality
- Cross-sell and upsell become natural
- Bundles offer volume pricing they'll appreciate

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your land motion** - Are you asking prospects to evaluate multiple products at once? If so, you're adding friction.

2. **Identify your "tip of spear" product** - Which product has the fastest time-to-value and clearest use case? Lead with that.

3. **Move bundles to expansion** - Once customers love product #1, introduce products #2 and #3 as add-ons or upgrades.

4. **Test with data, not intuition** - Atlassian tested everything: "We tried bundles. We didn't try bundles. We tried different things in the bundles. We tried different days. Data led insights are better than anything any pundits would say."

5. **Watch for bundle pressure from sales teams** - Sales naturally wants to sell more per deal. For PLG, this impulse can backfire at the acquisition stage.

## When Bundling DOES Work in PLG

- **Post-acquisition expansion**: Existing happy customers
- **Enterprise sales motion**: When you're layering sales assist on top of PLG
- **Self-service upgrades**: When bundles represent tiers (free → pro → enterprise) rather than product combinations

## The Broader Lesson

PLG success comes from removing friction. Every additional evaluation step, every extra product to understand, every moment of complexity works against you.

The same team that will happily evaluate a bundle when guided by sales will abandon the process when doing it themselves online.
