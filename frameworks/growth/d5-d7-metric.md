# D5/D7 Metric

> "We call it D5, D7. A lot of other companies call it L5, L7. But the human explanation for that is how many people turn to Arc at least five days a week? That is all we obsess over from a metrics perspective, because for us it captures retention, engagement, and growth in a single metric. You can't game it." - Josh Miller

## What It Is

D5/D7 (or L5/L7 at other companies) is a focused metric that counts users who actively use your product at least 5 days out of every 7. Unlike daily active users (DAU) or monthly active users (MAU), this metric sets a high bar that captures true product engagement.

The power of D5/D7 is that it collapses multiple important indicators into one number:
- **Retention**: Users must keep coming back over time
- **Engagement**: Using something 5+ days/week indicates genuine integration into daily life
- **Growth**: Track the absolute count to see if your high-engagement user base is growing

Because the bar is high (5 out of 7 days), it's difficult to game. You can't inflate this metric with accidental opens or one-time visits.

## How It Works

The metric functions on several principles:

1. **Count users, not sessions**: A user counts as "active for a day" if they perform a meaningful action (e.g., opening a tab) on that day.

2. **Weekly window**: Look at any 7-day period and count how many users were active on 5 or more of those days.

3. **Ignore absolute numbers initially**: Any point in time will look small if you're successful long-term. Focus on growth rate instead.

4. **Track week-over-week growth rate**: Is the D5/D7 count growing faster or slower than last week?

5. **Compare cohorts over time**: Are newer cohorts retaining at the same or better rates than earlier cohorts?

## How to Apply It

1. **Define your meaningful action**: What action indicates a user actually engaged with your product? For a browser, it's opening a tab. For other products, it might be creating content, completing a workflow, etc.

2. **Set up the tracking**: Count unique users who performed the meaningful action on 5+ of the last 7 days.

3. **Focus on growth rate, not absolute numbers**: If you're early stage, your absolute D5/D7 count will seem small. That's fine. Is it growing 10%+ week over week?

4. **Monitor cohort trends**: Are you retaining new users as well as (or better than) your early adopters? If cohort retention is improving over time, you're building something people love.

5. **Don't obsess over blips**: Look for sustained trends rather than weekly variance.

## When to Use It

- When building consumer products that aim for daily use
- When DAU/MAU feels too easy to game or doesn't capture true engagement
- When you want a single metric to align the entire team around
- When you need to demonstrate genuine product-market fit (not just downloads or signups)
- When you're competing with incumbent products and need to prove you're becoming essential
