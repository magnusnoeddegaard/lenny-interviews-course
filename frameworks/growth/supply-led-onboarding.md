# Supply-Led Onboarding (Mentor/Ambassador Model)

> "We would pay our best drivers $35 per mentor session... What they did was they would share personal tips on when and where to drive. Oftentimes they shared their contact info. And this created tremendous leverage and social proof for those new drivers who were on the fence about taking strangers into their car." - Benjamin Lauzier

## What It Is

Supply-Led Onboarding is a growth strategy where your best existing supply (drivers, hosts, professionals) are paid to onboard, train, and recruit new supply. Instead of company employees handling onboarding, top performers in your marketplace do it—creating social proof, better activation rates, and recognition for your best contributors.

Lyft pioneered this as the "mentor program" when competing against Uber with 1/30th the resources. It allowed them to match Uber's geographic footprint with a fraction of the people and budget.

## How It Works

**The Traditional Model (Uber's approach at the time):**
- Launch team flies to new market
- Sign office lease, hire local staff
- Run DMV-style group onboarding sessions
- High cost, long lead time, limited scalability

**The Supply-Led Model (Lyft's mentor program):**
- Identify top-rated, experienced supply (4.9+ stars, 100+ rides)
- Train them as "mentors" who can conduct onboarding
- Pay them per successful onboarding session ($35 at Lyft)
- New supply meets mentor for vehicle inspection, document check, and "ride along"

**Why It Works Better:**

1. **Social proof**: New drivers hear from real drivers, not marketing emails
2. **Better tips**: Mentors share practical advice ("Drive Tuesday at 2PM near downtown")
3. **Relationship building**: Mentors often share contact info, creating ongoing support
4. **Cost efficiency**: $35/session vs. full-time employee + office lease
5. **Scalability**: Fly small team to vet initial mentors, then scale organically
6. **Mentor retention**: Top performers feel recognized and earn extra income

## How to Apply It

### Phase 1: Mentor Program (Onboarding)

1. **Define mentor criteria** - What makes someone qualified? (Rating, tenure, volume)
2. **Design the onboarding protocol** - What must be verified? What training is needed?
3. **Set compensation** - Pay per successful onboarding, not per hour
4. **Track quality** - Monitor how mentor-onboarded supply performs vs. company-onboarded
5. **Scale gradually** - Start with small pilot, expand as you validate quality

### Phase 2: Recruiter Program (Acquisition)

1. **Identify funnel drop-offs** - Where do potential supply abandon?
2. **Give top supply a "sales dashboard"** - Show them leads to follow up with
3. **Enable outreach** - Let them call/text prospects who dropped off
4. **Compensate for conversions** - Pay per successful activation ($20 at Lyft)

### Phase 3: Utilization Smoothing

Use recruiter calls to fill low-utilization periods:
- When ride demand is low, drivers can make money calling prospects
- Converts idle time into productive acquisition work
- Smooths out supply-demand mismatches

## When to Use It

- **Competing with larger players**: When you can't match competitor resources
- **Rapid geographic expansion**: Scale without opening offices
- **High-friction onboarding**: When new supply needs hands-on validation
- **Strong brand affinity**: When your supply are advocates, not just contractors

## Results at Lyft

- Matched most of Uber's footprint with 1/10-1/20 resources
- Mentor-activated drivers showed higher engagement and retention
- Top mentors earned $70/hour doing two sessions per hour
- Mentors had lower churn—felt recognized and "promoted"
- Recruiter-called prospects converted at higher rates than email/SMS

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Quality control | Set clear standards, audit mentor sessions |
| Brand consistency | Provide scripts/guidelines for key messages |
| Fraud | Tie payment to new supply activity, not just sign-up |
| Mentor burnout | Cap sessions, rotate opportunities |
