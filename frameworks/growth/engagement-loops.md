# Engagement Loops

> "If someone is living their life, having a happy time, then for some reason they use your product—why did they use your product? What made them come back?" - Eric Ries

## What It Is

Engagement Loops are a framework for understanding why and how customers return to your product. Eric Ries developed this as the retention counterpart to viral loops—while viral loops explain how products spread, engagement loops explain how products stick.

The key insight is that there are only three fundamental mechanisms that bring customers back to a product. Understanding which loop powers your retention allows you to measure, optimize, and design for it intentionally.

## How It Works

### The Three Engagement Loop Mechanisms

**1. Synthetic Notifications**
Direct, product-generated reminders to return.

*Examples*:
- "You haven't logged in for 7 days" emails
- Push notifications about new features
- Re-engagement campaigns

*Characteristics*:
- Fully within your control
- Can feel spammy if overused
- Works for breaking initial habit barriers

**2. Organic Notifications**
External triggers caused by other users or real-world events.

*Examples*:
- PayPal: "You've got money, click here"
- Facebook: "Someone tagged you in a photo"
- Email from a friend on your platform
- Calendar reminders for events created in your product

*Characteristics*:
- Much higher engagement rates than synthetic
- Driven by genuine value or curiosity
- The notification carries real information the user wants

**3. Positioning (Internal Trigger)**
Something in the user's brain tells them to use the product—no external prompt needed.

*Examples*:
- Feeling hungry → ordering food
- Feeling bored → opening game
- Need to communicate → opening Slack
- Want to know something → opening search

*Characteristics*:
- The most powerful and sustainable loop
- Requires the product to "own" a mental trigger
- Takes time to build but creates defensible habit

## How to Apply It

1. **Map your current loops**: For each user segment, identify which of the three mechanisms brings them back. Are you relying on synthetic notifications? Organic triggers? Or have you achieved positioning?

2. **Measure each loop separately**:
   - Track open rates and return rates from synthetic notifications
   - Track engagement from organic notifications (tagged content, shared items)
   - Measure unprompted sessions (returns with no prior trigger)

3. **Design for the right loop**:
   - If relying on synthetic: Improve relevance and timing, but know this is often a crutch
   - If relying on organic: Maximize opportunities for user-to-user triggers
   - If building positioning: Focus on owning a specific moment or need in users' lives

4. **Graduate up the ladder**: The goal is to move from synthetic → organic → positioning as you build habits and mental associations.

## When to Use It

- When analyzing why retention is low or high
- When designing notification strategies
- When deciding what product moments to invest in
- When building a new product and planning for retention from day one

## Why This Framework Matters

Eric Ries notes that viral loops get enormous attention while engagement loops are largely ignored—despite being equally important to sustainable growth. This asymmetry represents a major blind spot:

> "I can't for the life of me understand why viral loops gets all the attention and no one is remotely interested in the science of engagement."

Understanding engagement loops provides the same rigorous, measurable approach to retention that viral loops provide for acquisition.
