# Unit of Use Principle

> "The unit of use for Duolingo is doing a lesson. And so, if what we care about is users coming back every day and doing a lesson, because it shows that they're actually engaging with the app, then it doesn't hurt us to make our streak focus on just do one unit versus multiple." - Jackson Shuttleworth

## What It Is

The Unit of Use Principle states that streak mechanics should be tied to completing one meaningful unit of engagement in your app—not arbitrary metrics, not multiple units, and not partial units. The unit should be what users naturally think of as "using the app" in a complete way.

Duolingo originally required users to hit XP targets to extend their streak, which meant users could do multiple lessons and still fail. When they switched to "complete one lesson," it was a massive win—even though it was technically easier. The lesson is clear: simplicity + meaningful unit beats complexity + arbitrary thresholds.

## How It Works

### Finding Your Unit of Use

Ask: "What do users naturally think of as one complete interaction with our product?"

**Good units of use:**
- Duolingo: Complete one lesson
- Peloton: Complete one workout (weekly streak)
- Reading apps: Read one chapter/article
- Meditation apps: Complete one session
- Language apps: Complete one practice session

**Bad units of use:**
- XP-based targets (arbitrary, confusing)
- Partial completions (not satisfying)
- Time-based requirements (doesn't equal engagement)
- Multiple required actions (too punishing)

### The Goldilocks Zone

Duolingo tested three variants:
1. **XP-based** (original): Complex, users could do work and still "fail"
2. **One lesson** (winner): Simple, meaningful, achievable
3. **One exercise** (too easy): Lost—captured only the least engaged users, unclear unit

The sweet spot: One complete, meaningful action that users understand intuitively.

### Why This Works

- **Simplicity**: Users immediately understand "do one lesson"
- **Achievability**: Every user can complete one unit
- **Meaning**: Completing a unit feels like genuine engagement
- **Universality**: Works across user types and contexts

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your natural unit**
   - What do users describe as "using" your app?
   - What's the atomic action that delivers value?
   - What do users naturally complete in one session?

2. **Test the boundaries**
   - Try one unit vs. partial unit vs. multiple units
   - Measure both retention AND quality of engagement
   - Watch for capturing only low-intent users if you go too easy

3. **Keep it simple**
   - Avoid XP/points as the streak requirement
   - Don't require users to do math
   - Make the requirement instantly understandable

4. **Match cadence to behavior**
   - Daily for daily-use products (Duolingo)
   - Weekly for less frequent products (Peloton)
   - The unit should feel achievable within the natural cadence

## When to Use It

- When designing or redesigning streak mechanics
- When your current streak feels arbitrary or confusing
- When users extend streaks without meaningful engagement
- When users fail streaks despite genuine effort
