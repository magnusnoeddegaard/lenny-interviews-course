# PLG vs SLG Funnel Model

> "The biggest difference from SLG and PLG is that the sales funnel traditionally work like something... You have marketing team working on the top of funnel, bring visitor and then they need to have a process to turn the visitors into lead... But product-led funnel is different. It's much more similar to B2C. The most important thing, the biggest difference, is now you want them to use the product." - Hila Qu

## What It Is

The PLG vs SLG Funnel Model explains the fundamental structural differences between product-led growth funnels and traditional sales-led growth funnels. Understanding these differences is the essential first step before adding a PLG motion to any business.

In sales-led growth (SLG), marketing generates leads who are scored based on their engagement with marketing content (white papers, webinars, emails). High-scoring leads become Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) passed to sales for conversion.

In product-led growth (PLG), users sign up and actually use the product. Their product usage becomes the primary signal of intent and fit, creating Product Qualified Leads (PQLs) with two potential conversion paths: self-serve checkout or sales-assisted.

## How It Works

### Sales-Led Growth (SLG) Funnel

1. **Visitors** → Marketing attracts website visitors
2. **Leads** → Visitors submit forms, become leads
3. **Lead Scoring** → Marketing scores based on profile fit + campaign engagement
4. **MQL** → Marketing Qualified Leads reach threshold score
5. **SQL** → Sales accepts and works qualified leads
6. **Customer** → Sales closes the deal, then user can access product

**Key characteristic**: Users can't access the product until after the sale is made.

### Product-Led Growth (PLG) Funnel

1. **Visitors** → Marketing/organic attracts visitors
2. **Signup** → Users sign up for free version/trial
3. **Activation** → Users actually use the product, reach aha moment
4. **Two Conversion Paths**:
   - **Self-Serve**: Low price point → User pays via checkout flow
   - **PQL/PQA Path**: High usage + ideal customer profile → Sales outreach → Enterprise deal

**Key characteristic**: Product usage is the leading indicator for success, not marketing engagement.

### The Critical Difference

In SLG, intent is measured by: "How much do they interact with marketing campaigns?"
In PLG, intent is measured by: "How much do they actually use the product?"

## How to Apply It

1. **Map your current funnel** - Understand which model you're currently running. Most B2B companies start sales-led.

2. **Identify the gaps** - If moving to PLG, you likely need:
   - A free product or trial (the vehicle)
   - Self-serve checkout capability
   - Product analytics to track usage
   - Definition of what constitutes a PQL

3. **Define your PQL criteria** - What combination of:
   - Usage behavior (features used, frequency)
   - Customer fit (company size, industry)
   ...indicates someone is ready for sales outreach?

4. **Build both conversion paths** - PLG works best with:
   - Self-serve for SMB/individual buyers
   - Sales-assisted for enterprise accounts

5. **Shift metrics** - Move from MQL-focused metrics to:
   - Signups (not just leads)
   - Activation rate
   - Usage-based conversion signals

## When to Use It

- When deciding whether to add PLG to your business
- When designing your go-to-market motion
- When restructuring teams around a new funnel model
- When explaining PLG to sales/marketing stakeholders
- When diagnosing why PLG isn't working (often: treating it like SLG)
