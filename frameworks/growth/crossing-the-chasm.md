# Crossing the Chasm

> "The pragmatist looks at the visionary and goes, 'That's not my guy. First of all, he thinks I'm smarter than I am. Second, he does stuff that I would never do, and he makes decisions in a way that I would never make them.'" - Geoffrey Moore

## What It Is

The chasm is a dangerous gap in the technology adoption lifecycle between visionaries (early adopters) and pragmatists (early majority). It's where promising companies with exciting technology and marquee early customers go to die.

The core problem: visionaries and pragmatists have fundamentally incompatible buying behaviors. Visionaries make their own decisions and specifically avoid doing what their peers do. Pragmatists only buy what they see their peers buying. So visionary success provides zero leverage for winning pragmatists.

Companies that don't recognize this gap often interpret their visionary traction as proof of mainstream appeal, then wonder why sales suddenly stall despite having impressive case studies.

## How It Works

**Why the Chasm Exists**

1. **Visionaries want to be different** - They make independent decisions and specifically avoid what's popular. If their peers are doing it, they probably won't.

2. **Pragmatists want to be safe** - They need references from people like themselves before making risky purchases. It's the "antelope strategy"—follow the herd.

3. **Pragmatists won't accept visionary references** - They don't trust visionaries because:
   - Visionaries think they're smarter than pragmatists
   - Visionaries do "weird things" pragmatists would never do
   - Pragmatists often have to clean up the messes visionaries leave behind

4. **No pragmatist references exist yet** - It's the junior high dance problem: everyone's waiting for someone else to go first.

**The Result**

Your company has excited early adopters, impressive logos, maybe even press coverage. But sales plateau. You can't convert interest into repeatable revenue. You're stuck in the chasm.

## How to Cross It

**1. Find a Beachhead Segment**

Select a target market that is:
- **Big enough to matter** - Room to grow (10M → 100M trajectory)
- **Small enough to lead** - You can become 30-50% market share in 2 years
- **Good fit with your crown jewels** - Your technology actually solves their problem

"Your beachhead segment should NOT be the Fortune 500."

**2. Find the Compelling Reason to Buy**

Not a compelling reason to sell—a compelling reason to buy. Look for:
- Problems that are actively deteriorating
- Situations where the current solution is failing
- Pain severe enough that customers will take risk on an unproven vendor

"The customer has already talked to everybody they know, and the problem is still unsolved. It's not just unsolved—it's getting worse."

**3. Commit to the Problem**

Stop talking about yourself. Start talking about them.
- "Shut the laptop. Don't open it."
- Start every conversation: "We understand there's a serious problem around X in your industry. Do you have it?"
- If they say "not exactly," wait—they'll tell you their real problem

**4. Build a Whole Product Solution**

Pragmatists need a complete solution, not a cool technology:
- Work with partners to fill gaps
- Over-commit to solving their specific problem
- "We're not leaving until you're satisfied"

**5. Win 3-5 Reference Customers in the Segment**

Get pragmatist references that other pragmatists will trust:
- Same geography (people in Japan don't talk to people in America)
- Same industry (dentists don't talk to software designers)
- Same profession (salespeople don't talk to finance people)
- Same use case (the compelling reason to buy)

When pragmatists see three or four peers choosing you, "it's pretty obvious who the standard is."

## Signs You've Crossed

- You don't need to raise more venture capital
- You could raise it on your terms and timeline
- You've become a "going concern"—a company expected to still exist in two years
- CAC and LTV are established
- An ecosystem of partners brings you into deals

## Common Mistakes (Seven Deadly Sins)

1. **Target customer mix-up** - Targeting the Fortune 500 instead of a focused niche
2. **Compelling reason confusion** - Focusing on compelling reasons to sell, not buy
3. **Discounting before crossing** - Lowering prices doesn't reduce risk; it may increase it
4. **Using visionary references for pragmatists** - They won't work
5. **Hiring enterprise salespeople too early** - They're built for horizontal coverage, not domain expertise
6. **Spreading too thin** - Running the match back and forth under a log instead of starting a fire
7. **Skipping the marquee customer** - You need a lighthouse customer before attempting to cross

## The Bonfire Analogy

"The tendency when you're in the chasm is, 'I just need more customers. I should take any customer I can find.' It's like taking a match and running it back and forth under a log. It's not going to light the log. You start a fire by putting a little kindling, a little crumpled up paper, and you hold the match in one place until the fire starts."

Adjacency matters: "If the piece of kindling is here, but the log is in the other room, that doesn't work."
