# Customer-Led Growth (CLG)

> "The idea is, understand your best customers, map their experience through the lens of delivering value to them, make it measurable, and then evaluate what you're doing today that is out of alignment with that." - Gia Laudi

## What It Is

Customer-Led Growth is a methodology for SaaS companies to unlock and accelerate growth by centering their entire strategy around delivering value to ideal customers. Unlike traditional funnel-based approaches that focus on business metrics, CLG focuses on customer milestones and the value customers receive at each stage of their journey.

The core premise is that growth isn't about pushing people through a funnel—it's about understanding what your best customers need to succeed and systematically delivering that value. When you align your product, marketing, and customer experience around customer jobs and desired outcomes, growth follows naturally.

CLG emerged from dissatisfaction with pirate metrics (AARRR), MQLs, SQLs, and traditional funnel thinking. These approaches put the business at the center rather than the customer, assume all customers are the same, and typically end at acquisition—ignoring the retention, expansion, and advocacy that drive sustainable SaaS growth.

## How It Works

The Customer-Led Growth process follows four main steps:

**1. Understand Your Best Customers**
- Define "best customers" as those who get tremendous value from your product, pay willingly, are low maintenance, and signed up recently enough (3-6 months) to remember their journey
- Conduct surveys or interviews using Jobs to Be Done methodology
- Identify customer jobs, triggers, desired outcomes, and what convinced them your product could help

**2. Map Their Experience**
- Create a customer journey map from their perspective, not yours
- Map through three phases: Struggle (problem awareness, solution seeking), Evaluation (first value, value realization), and Growth (continued value, expansion)
- Include the emotional journey, not just the functional steps
- Keep milestones minimal—aim for six or fewer, not twelve

**3. Make It Measurable**
- Define a KPI for each milestone that indicates customers reached that value moment
- For struggle phase: website visitors, conversion rate on primary CTA
- For evaluation phase: specific product activation metrics tied to what customers said was most valuable
- For growth phase: frequency of usage, feature adoption, expansion triggers

**4. Evaluate and Optimize**
- Identify where your current experience is out of alignment with customer needs
- Build proactive experiences to push customers toward value
- Create reactive experiences to catch and re-engage those who fall off
- Use customer-voiced messaging throughout the journey

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your best customers** - Query your customer base for those who are happy, paying, low-maintenance, and signed up in the last 3-6 months

2. **Survey or interview them** using JTBD questions:
   - What was going on when you started seeking a solution?
   - What was the trigger moment?
   - Who/what did you consult during your search?
   - What were your must-haves vs. deal-breakers?
   - What convinced you this product could solve your problem?
   - What can you do now that you couldn't before?

3. **Prioritize one customer job** to focus on (see Job Prioritization Criteria)

4. **Create a customer experience map** showing the story of how customers meet and fall in love with your product

5. **Tie product attributes to value moments** - Connect what customers said they value to specific features and usage patterns

6. **Define milestone KPIs** - Set measurable thresholds for each stage (e.g., "5+ searches AND created at least 1 list")

7. **Build proactive and reactive experiences** - Emails, in-app messages, and product flows that help customers reach each milestone and catch them if they fall off

## When to Use It

- When free-to-paid conversion is lower than expected
- When trial-to-paid or onboarding completion rates are underperforming
- When website traffic is healthy but signups or activation lag
- When you're unsure which customer segment to prioritize
- When product, marketing, and CS teams aren't aligned on customer value
- When you've grown past founder intuition and need a systematic approach
