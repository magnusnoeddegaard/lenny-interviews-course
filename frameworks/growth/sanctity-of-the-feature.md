# Sanctity of the Feature

> "My co-lead, Antonia, she is the keeper for us of the sanctity of the streak. You can almost always get engagement wins, up to a certain point, by just cheapening the streak, making it easier to extend, letting users have more flexibility, but you kind of got to hold the line at some point." - Jackson Shuttleworth

## What It Is

Sanctity of the Feature is a product management principle that assigns explicit ownership of a feature's meaningfulness, not just its metrics. While optimization teams push for engagement gains (often by making features easier), the "keeper of sanctity" protects the feature from becoming so easy that users stop caring.

This role recognizes that some features create value precisely because they're hard—and that optimization without boundaries eventually destroys what made the feature valuable.

## How It Works

### The Optimization Trap

Every feature can be "improved" by making it easier:
- More forgiveness for failures
- Lower thresholds for achievement
- More free passes and second chances

These changes often win experiments in the short term. But if taken too far:
- Users stop taking the feature seriously
- The achievement loses its meaning
- Long-term engagement drops as users stop caring

### The Keeper Role

Someone must hold the line. At Duolingo:
- Antonia protects streak meaningfulness
- Luis (CEO) acts as final arbiter in product review
- Every experiment that cheapens the streak must justify itself

### The One-Way Door Warning

> "Once you go too far it's a one-way door, and all of a sudden those 9 million users on one-year streaks don't care about their streak anymore. That would be an extinction-level event for us."

Some degradations are irreversible. Once users learn a feature is meaningless, you can't restore its value.

### What the Keeper Does

1. **Questions easy wins**: "Yes, this won, but does it cheapen the feature?"
2. **Tracks cumulative impact**: Individual changes may be fine; the sum may not be
3. **Maintains long-term vision**: Knows where the line is, even when metrics say keep going
4. **Creates friction for degradation**: Makes it harder to approve cheapening changes
5. **Resets when needed**: Periodically simplifies by removing accumulated cruft

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your sacred features**
   - Which features create value because they're meaningful?
   - Which achievements would lose power if made too easy?
   - Where are you most tempted to "just add more forgiveness"?

2. **Assign a keeper**
   - Someone who cares about the feature's soul, not just its metrics
   - Give them veto or escalation power on changes
   - Make them accountable for long-term health, not just short-term wins

3. **Create review checkpoints**
   - Every experiment that increases flexibility should be scrutinized
   - Track cumulative flexibility changes over time
   - Periodic audits: "Is this feature still meaningful?"

4. **Define the line**
   - What would make users stop caring?
   - What's the maximum flexibility before the feature is meaningless?
   - Document this as a principle, not just a feeling

5. **Plan for resets**
   - Occasionally strip back accumulated easiness
   - Launch neutral experiments that simplify
   - Accept short-term metric hits for long-term health

## When to Use It

- When a feature's value comes from its challenge or rarity
- When short-term optimization is eroding long-term meaning
- When multiple teams can propose changes to a high-value feature
- When an achievement system is gradually becoming meaningless
