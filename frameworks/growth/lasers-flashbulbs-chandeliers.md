# Lasers, Flash Bulbs, and Chandeliers

> "My co-founder Joe used to have this metaphor of lasers, flash bulbs and chandeliers. If you want to light up a room, performance marketing is a laser. It can light up a corner of a room. You don't want to use a bunch of lasers to light up an entire room. You should use a chandelier and that's what brand marketing is." - Brian Chesky

## What It Is

Lasers, Flash Bulbs, and Chandeliers is a metaphor for understanding different marketing approaches and their appropriate uses. Developed by Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, it helps teams avoid the common mistake of trying to achieve brand awareness through performance marketing, or vice versa.

The framework emerged from Airbnb's experience spending $1 billion annually on performance marketing (Google AdWords) before realizing this approach wasn't building lasting brand equity or compounding advantages. It helped clarify why certain marketing investments felt inefficient—they were using the wrong tool for the job.

## How It Works

**Lasers (Performance Marketing)**
- Precisely targeted, narrow focus
- Great for lighting up a specific corner
- Measurable, attributable results
- Doesn't create accumulating advantages
- Best for: Balancing supply/demand, targeting specific segments, arbitrage opportunities

**Flash Bulbs (Event/PR Marketing)**
- Bright, attention-getting bursts
- Wide but temporary illumination
- Creates moments of awareness
- Best for: Launches, announcements, news cycles

**Chandeliers (Brand Marketing)**
- Illuminates the entire room
- Sustained, ambient light
- Builds long-term brand equity
- Best for: Broad awareness, education, positioning

**The Core Insight:**
You can't light up an entire room with a collection of lasers. If your goal is broad market awareness, you need a chandelier (brand marketing). If your goal is precision targeting, use a laser (performance marketing). Matching the wrong tool to the objective wastes resources.

## How to Apply It

1. **Clarify your objective** - Are you trying to light up a corner (specific segment conversion) or the whole room (broad awareness)?

2. **Match the tool to the job**:
   - Need precision targeting? → Performance marketing (laser)
   - Need broad awareness/education? → Brand marketing (chandelier)
   - Need a moment of attention? → PR/events (flash bulb)

3. **Audit your current mix** - If you're spending heavily on performance marketing but want brand awareness, you're using lasers to light a room

4. **Evaluate ROI appropriately** - Don't measure chandeliers with laser metrics (direct attribution doesn't capture ambient light)

5. **Consider compounding** - Performance marketing is not an investment; brand marketing can build accumulating advantages

## When to Use It

- When evaluating your marketing mix allocation
- When performance marketing feels inefficient but metrics look fine
- When trying to explain why brand investment matters
- When teams default to measurable channels over effective ones
- During budget planning and channel strategy discussions

## The Airbnb Lesson

Before the pandemic, Airbnb was spending $1B on performance marketing annually. The realization was:

> "Performance marketing doesn't create very good accumulating advantages because it's not an investment. If you want to build it permanently... you actually need to be investing. And so we think of marketing as education. That we're educating people on the unique benefits."

Airbnb shifted to treating marketing as education about new product features, requiring product marketing and brand marketing to work together on launches. The result was a more efficient marketing mix that built long-term brand value.
