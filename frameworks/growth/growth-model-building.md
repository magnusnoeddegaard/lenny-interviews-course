# Growth Model Building

> "50% of the value you get from it is simply building the model. It forces you to understand [how the business works] and then you get this artifact which you can use to understand how to weigh different opportunities." - Dan Hockenmaier

## What It Is

A growth model is an analytical representation of how your business grows, typically built in a spreadsheet. Unlike a financial forecast, it's not meant to predict exact numbers—it's a tool for understanding which levers drive growth and how they interact.

The model forces rigor because spreadsheets are "very hard to fake"—you can talk about a business conceptually, but when you actually have to get everything to link up in a model, you must truly understand how the business works.

## How It Works

### Core Building Blocks (SaaS)

For a SaaS business, you need three components:

1. **Acquisition Channels**
   - Traffic sources (paid, organic, viral)
   - Spend or volume assumptions
   - Conversion rates

2. **Retention**
   - Activation rates
   - Monthly retention curves
   - Cohort survival rates over time

3. **Monetization**
   - Monthly/annual fees
   - Revenue per customer

### Additional Layers (Transactional/Marketplace)

For transactional businesses, add:
- Transactions per month
- Average order value (AOV)
- Unit economics (COGS, costs per transaction)

For marketplaces, you also need:
- Supply-side acquisition and retention
- The interaction between supply and demand
- How adding supply impacts demand retention

### Making It Non-Linear

The model gets powerful when you add compounding effects:
- **Virality**: Existing customers referring new ones
- **Reinvestment**: Contribution margin funding new acquisition
- **Payback period**: Speed of capital return affecting growth rate

## How to Apply It

1. **Start Simple**: Build the basic acquisition → retention → monetization flow first

2. **Partner with the Right People**: Find a smart analyst or finance person to build with you—this is a collaborative exercise

3. **Accept Iteration**: You won't get it right immediately. There's a feedback loop between team performance and model accuracy over multiple quarters

4. **Build Dual Models**:
   - One high-level conceptual model for understanding the whole system
   - Mini-models for each product pod focused on their specific north star

5. **Use for Resource Allocation**: In planning cycles, use the model as a "common currency" to compare investments across different teams and initiatives

## When to Use It

- **Annual/quarterly planning**: Zero-based budgeting for pod allocation
- **Opportunity assessment**: Comparing the value of working on different metrics
- **Understanding leverage**: Discovering which inputs have outsized impact on outputs
- **Team strategy docs**: Each product team should have a mini-model explaining how their work drives their north star

## Key Insight: Retention Sensitivity

One of the most common discoveries when building growth models:

> "Your growth is much more sensitive to customer retention than you can ever intuit because there's a lot of interaction between having a healthy retained customer base and everything else you care about."

This often reveals that a smaller percentage gain on retention is more valuable than a bigger change in acquisition—leading to better resource allocation decisions.

## Cautions

- **Not a forecasting tool**: Don't replace your finance team's projections with this
- **Assumption stacking**: Be careful with marketplaces—many assumptions compound, and interactions between supply/demand are hard to model accurately
- **Junk in, junk out**: The model is only as good as your understanding of the underlying dynamics
