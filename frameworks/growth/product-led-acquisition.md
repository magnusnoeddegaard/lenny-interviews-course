# Product-Led Acquisition

> "Product-led acquisition is the absolute best way to grow any startup. Zero marginal cost to have users invite other users. It's scalable. It creates network graphs typically and has compounding effects." - Julian Shapiro

## What It Is

Product-Led Acquisition (PLA) is a growth strategy where the natural use of your product automatically drives new user acquisition. Unlike product-led growth (which often refers to self-serve sales funnels), PLA specifically focuses on how existing users bring in new users through the product's core functionality.

PLA differs fundamentally from referral programs. Referral programs offer artificial incentives for users to invite others, often attracting reward-seekers who may not be genuinely interested in the product. PLA creates natural invitation mechanisms where users invite others because doing so increases the value they get from the product.

Paul Graham's advice captures this well: "Don't start a startup where you need to go through someone else to get users."

## How It Works

PLA subdivides into four main categories:

### 1. Settling Debts
Users invite others to claim something owed to them.
- **PayPal/Venmo**: When you send someone money, they must create an account to receive it
- **OpenSea**: Buyers need accounts to receive purchased NFTs
- **Invoice tools**: Recipients must access the platform to receive payments

### 2. Critical Conversations
Users invite others to join conversations they otherwise cannot access.
- **WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord**: Friends must install the app to join group conversations
- **Slack**: Coworkers must join to communicate; Slack Connect extends this to vendors
- **iMessage**: Creates pressure for Android users to switch

### 3. Billboarding
The use of the product is inherently visible to others.
- **Email signatures**: "Sent from my iPhone" or "Sent via Hotmail"
- **Calendly links**: Shared publicly to schedule meetings
- **Dropbox/GoFundMe links**: URLs expose the brand
- **Physical products**: Tesla, AirPods, Nike - visible to everyone around you
- **NFT profile pictures**: Display collection membership on social platforms
- **Ad networks**: "Brought to you by Google Ads"

### 4. User-Generated Content (UGC)
Users create content on the platform that spreads elsewhere.
- **TikTok/Instagram**: Users share content cross-platform, with platform branding attached
- **Marketplace listings**: Beautiful product pages shared on social media
- **Q&A platforms (Quora, Reddit, Stack Overflow)**: Conversations surface in Google search
- **Review sites (TripAdvisor, Yelp)**: User content drives SEO traffic

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your product for PLA potential**
   - Does using your product involve sending anything to non-users?
   - Could you add chat or messaging features that require others to join?
   - Is your product visible when being used?
   - Do users create content that could be shared elsewhere?

2. **Prioritize PLA-enabling features on your roadmap**
   - Features that facilitate debt settlement (payments, transfers, deliveries)
   - Communication features that pull in new users
   - Shareable content or URLs with your branding
   - Exportable/shareable user-generated content

3. **Remove friction from the invitation flow**
   - Make it easy for the invited person to claim value
   - Ensure the invitation clearly communicates the value proposition
   - Design onboarding around the specific invitation context

4. **Avoid depending on volatile external channels**
   - SEO can tank with algorithm updates
   - Paid acquisition suffers from CPM volatility
   - PLA gives you control over your growth

## When to Use It

- **Idea selection**: Choose startup ideas that naturally lend themselves to PLA
- **Product planning**: Prioritize features that enable PLA mechanisms
- **Growth strategy**: Build your primary growth engine around PLA before paid/content channels
- **Investment evaluation**: Companies with strong PLA mechanics are more defensible
