# Good Pivot Criteria

> "A good pivot is like going home. It's warmer, it's closer to something that you're an expert at... It never occurred to you that this thing you know all about would be a good idea." - Dalton Caldwell

## What It Is

A successful startup pivot moves the founders closer to their areas of expertise, not further away. Based on patterns from hundreds of YC pivots, the pivots that work aren't random restarts—they build on accumulated knowledge and leverage unique insights the founders developed from their failed attempt.

This framework provides two key criteria for evaluating a potential pivot: Does it move you warmer (closer to what you know)? And does it build on what you learned?

## How It Works

**Criterion 1: Getting Warmer**

Good pivots move toward founder expertise:
- What do you actually know deeply?
- What have you spent years learning?
- What domain gives you unfair insight?

Bad pivots move away from expertise:
- Chasing hot trends you know nothing about
- Copying other startups' ideas
- Going into industries you've never worked in

**Criterion 2: Building on Learning**

Good pivots leverage accumulated knowledge:
- What did you learn building the failed product?
- What tools did you build along the way?
- What customer insights do you now have?

The best pivots are often things that were byproducts of the original work.

## Examples from YC

**Brex: VR Headsets → Corporate Cards**
- Started trying to build VR headsets
- Founders had previously built a FinTech company in Brazil
- Pivoted to corporate cards—something they actually knew about
- Dalton's advice: "You need to work more on the thing all about and not the thing nothing about"

**Retool: Venmo Clone → Internal Tools**
- Started as Cashew, a P2P payment app in the UK
- Built internal dashboards to operate their own product
- Had strong opinions about internal tooling from internships
- Pivoted to selling the tools they'd already been building

**Segment: Professor Feedback → Analytics Infrastructure**
- Started with classroom feedback software
- Learned about analytics running their first product
- Built a Mixed Panel competitor, which failed
- Created JavaScript library to send events to multiple endpoints
- Discovered customers wanted the library, not the analytics product
- "There's no way those founders could have started with the final idea"

**Zip: Multiple Pivots → Procurement Software**
- Founders tried six different ideas
- Eventually used a systematic approach: find large incumbents with low NPS
- Discovered procurement software—nobody else was working on it
- Combined expertise in execution with a knowable market need

## How to Apply It

**When considering a pivot:**

1. **Map your expertise**: List everything you deeply understand
   - Previous jobs and internships
   - Side projects and tools you've built
   - Industries you've worked in
   - Problems you've personally experienced

2. **Audit your learning**: What did the failed idea teach you?
   - Customer insights you gained
   - Technical skills you developed
   - Tools you built as side effects
   - Market dynamics you now understand

3. **Find the intersection**: What new idea combines your expertise with your learning?

4. **Check for warmth**: Does this feel like going home?
   - You can talk about it without slides
   - You have opinions others don't have
   - You know the customers personally

**Red flags for bad pivots:**
- You'd need to learn an entirely new industry
- The idea came from copying someone else
- You have no unique insight or advantage
- It's "hot" but you have no connection to it

## When to Use It

- When your current startup isn't working
- When evaluating whether to pivot or persist
- When brainstorming new startup ideas
- When helping other founders think through pivots

## Common Mistakes

**Fighting the warmth**
Sometimes founders know exactly what they should work on but consciously resist it:
- "I'm burnt out on that space"
- "That seems too boring"
- "I want to do something new"

Sometimes the barrier is psychological, not logical.

**Thinking you need to start over**
The best pivots aren't restarts—they're evolutions. Don't throw away everything you learned.

**Chasing what's hot instead of what you know**
Information diet convergence means everyone has the same "hot" ideas. Your advantage comes from unique knowledge.
