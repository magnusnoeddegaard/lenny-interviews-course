# Internet Computer Vision

> "We want to be to the web browser, what the iPhone was to the cell phone. Yes. The iPhone replaced your cell phone, but it really was something much more. And so, we want Arc to be the iPhone for the internet, and that yes, it replaces your default browser. But... it really is that interface, this new type of computer." - Josh Miller

## What It Is

The Internet Computer Vision is a strategic framework for understanding where computing is headed and how to build for that future. The core insight: as everything moves to the cloud (applications, files, photos, data), local devices become "empty shells"—just interfaces to your real computer, which exists on the internet.

If this is true, then the browser isn't just a tool for viewing websites—it's the operating system for cloud-based computing. The company that builds the best interface to this "internet computer" has an opportunity comparable to building the iPhone.

This vision reframes what a browser company is building: not a better way to view web pages, but a new category of computing interface for a cloud-native world.

## How It Works

The strategic framework rests on several observations:

**The Cloud Migration**
- Applications are web-based (even "native" apps are often web views)
- Files live in the cloud (Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud)
- Photos sync automatically to cloud storage
- If you smash your device, you lose almost nothing—just the hardware

**The Hardware Commoditization**
- Computers, phones, cars, TVs are all becoming computing interfaces
- They're increasingly interchangeable empty shells
- The valuable computing lives "out there" on the internet

**The Platform Opportunity**
- The web is the best development platform (free, open, cross-platform, no 30% tax)
- But current browser makers (Google, Apple) have incentives to limit it
- Google wants you searching, not using rich web apps
- Apple wants you in the App Store, not the browser

**The Gap to Fill**
- Native software still feels better than web software
- The interface to the web (browsers) hasn't evolved to make web apps truly immersive
- Someone needs to build the iOS of the internet

## How to Apply It

1. **Think in platform terms**: If you're building in this space, consider how you become a platform others build on, not just an application

2. **Watch macro technology shifts**: The cloud migration is like mobile was—underestimating it is dangerous

3. **Question incumbents' incentives**: When big players aren't innovating in an area, ask why. Perverse incentives often create opportunities.

4. **Build the first-party apps, then the platform**: Like iPhone started with Notes and Safari before the App Store, prove the concept with your own experiences first

5. **Frame vision ambitiously**: "Better browser" is limiting; "interface to a new type of computer" is energizing

## When to Use It

- When evaluating startup opportunities in adjacent spaces (browsers, productivity, cloud tools)
- When thinking about where computing is heading in 5-10 years
- When building products that sit at the intersection of web and native
- When trying to understand why incumbents aren't innovating faster
- When defining an ambitious company vision that attracts talent
