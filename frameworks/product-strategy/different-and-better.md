# Different and Better

> "Being different is not enough, because it's very easy to build a thing that's different from what exists today, because you just have to look at what exists today and build something else. Being better is not enough, because it's also easy to say, 'Hey, I'm going to make this thing better, and just charge you more money for it.' It has to be better than what exists today in a way that matters to the end user." - Ayo Omojola

## What It Is

The Different and Better framework is a product differentiation test from Cash App's success. It argues that successful products must satisfy three conditions simultaneously, not just one or two.

Being merely "different" is insufficient—you can always find a way to build something that doesn't exist yet. Being merely "better" is also insufficient—incremental improvements that cost more don't create breakthrough products.

The key insight is that differentiation must exist at the intersection of: something novel, something superior, and something that genuinely matters to users. Cash App's success with instant money transfer exemplified this—they weren't just different (there were other payment apps), they were different AND better in a way that users actually cared about: getting money they could use immediately.

## How It Works

The framework evaluates products across three dimensions:

1. **Different**: Is it meaningfully distinct from existing solutions?
2. **Better**: Does it outperform existing solutions on key dimensions?
3. **Matters**: Is the improvement in an area users genuinely care about?

A product must pass all three tests. Cash App's "instant" feature demonstrates this:
- **Different**: No other app offered truly instant, usable money
- **Better**: Faster than Venmo, PayPal, and bank transfers
- **Matters**: Users cared deeply about accessing their money immediately

The framework also requires being in a **domain that matters**—a market with real economics, not just art or hobby projects.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your "instant"** - Find the single differentiator you can use as a clear demonstration. For Cash App, Ayo could say: "Try and send me a dollar that I can use now." Only one app could do it.

2. **Apply the three-part test**:
   - Can you articulate how you're different from the market leader?
   - Is your difference actually better, not just novel?
   - When you show users the difference, do they care?

3. **Create a simple demonstration** - Build a quick test that instantly proves your differentiation. The "send me a dollar I can use now" challenge was Cash App's proof point.

4. **Validate the domain** - Confirm you're in a market with real economics, not just building "art" (a thing that's different and better but hard to scale).

5. **Double down consistently** - Cash App applied "instant" across everything: instant cashout, instant card issuance, instant stock availability, instant Bitcoin availability. Once you find your differentiator, apply it relentlessly.

## When to Use It

- **Entering a crowded market**: When competitors like Venmo already exist, you need a clear "Different and Better" dimension
- **Product positioning**: When crafting your value proposition and messaging
- **Feature prioritization**: When deciding what to build, prioritize features that reinforce your "Different and Better" dimension
- **Consumer products**: Especially relevant for B2C where differentiation is visible to end users
- **Startup pitch development**: When explaining why you'll win against incumbents
