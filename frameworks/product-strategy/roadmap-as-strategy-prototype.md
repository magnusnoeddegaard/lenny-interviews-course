# Roadmap as Strategy Prototype

> "The value isn't the prototype, the value is in the prototyping process. The value isn't in your roadmap, the value is in the roadmapping process. What you're actually doing is laying out your assumptions of the problems that you're solving." - Janna Bastow

## What It Is

Roadmap as Strategy Prototype reframes how product teams think about roadmaps. Instead of viewing a roadmap as a delivery plan or commitment, treat it as a prototype - a way of checking your strategic assumptions that you expect to throw away and rebuild as you learn.

Just as designers create mockups to test feature assumptions with users, product managers should use roadmaps to test strategic assumptions with stakeholders, customers, and the team. The roadmap becomes a conversation tool rather than a contract.

This mindset shift is fundamental: the value isn't in the roadmap artifact itself, but in the roadmapping process - the conversations it generates and the alignment it creates.

## How It Works

**The Feature-Strategy Parallel:**

At the **feature level**, you prototype by:
1. Creating a mockup or design
2. Sharing it with someone and asking "What do you think?"
3. Learning what's right or wrong
4. Adjusting the design based on feedback
5. Throwing out the original prototype and making a better one

At the **strategy level**, you prototype by:
1. Laying out your assumptions about problems to solve
2. Sharing your roadmap and asking "I think we have this problem, then this problem. What do you think?"
3. Learning where assumptions are wrong or incomplete
4. Adjusting priorities based on feedback
5. Updating the roadmap to be stronger and more aligned

**The Key Insight:**

You wouldn't expect your first mockup to be the final design. Similarly, you shouldn't expect your roadmap to be the final plan. Both are meant to be tested, challenged, and improved through iteration.

## How to Apply It

1. **Share early and often** - Don't wait until your roadmap is "perfect." Share rough versions with teammates, customers, and stakeholders to check your assumptions early.

2. **Frame as questions, not answers** - Present roadmap items as hypotheses: "We believe solving X will lead to Y" rather than "We're building X by date Y."

3. **Invite challenge** - Explicitly ask stakeholders to poke holes in your thinking. The point is to find wrong assumptions before you invest in building.

4. **Expect changes** - When feedback reveals a gap in your thinking, update the roadmap. A roadmap that never changes is one that's not being tested.

5. **Track what you learned** - Document why roadmap items changed. This builds organizational learning about strategy.

## When to Use It

- When presenting roadmaps to leadership or cross-functional teams
- When conducting customer advisory board sessions
- When doing quarterly or annual planning
- When you need to get alignment across multiple stakeholders with different priorities
- When you're uncertain about strategic direction and need input

## Common Mistakes

- **Treating feedback as criticism** - Remember, you're testing assumptions. Finding a wrong assumption is success, not failure.
- **Sharing too late** - If you only share the roadmap after major decisions are locked, you've missed the prototyping benefit.
- **Ignoring feedback** - If you ask for input but never change anything, people stop giving honest feedback.
