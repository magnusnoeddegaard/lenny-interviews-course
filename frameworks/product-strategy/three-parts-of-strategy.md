# Three Parts of Strategy

> "I basically realized that there's three key components to strategy. And not everybody's thinking of all three, but if you have all three, you'll have something that counts as a strategy for anyone you talk to." - Jackie Bavaro

## What It Is

Jackie Bavaro developed this framework after years of confusion about what "strategy" really means. Early in her career at Google, she was told she needed to be "more strategic" but nobody could explain what that meant. Through experience at Google and Asana, she realized strategy has three distinct components that work together.

Many people use the word "strategy" to mean different things. Some think of vision, others think of a plan, and others think of a framework for making decisions. Bavaro's insight is that a complete strategy needs all three components to be actionable and compelling.

## How It Works

### 1. Vision
Your inspiring picture of what the future looks like. This is the "why we're doing this" that motivates the team.

- Paints a compelling picture of the end state
- Answers: "What world are we trying to create?"
- Used to recruit and inspire: "Come build this future with me!"
- Example from Asana: Teams working together like a guitar player's hands—ambient awareness without endless status updates

### 2. Strategic Framework
Your unique way of breaking down the problem. This is where the intellectual work of strategy happens.

- Defines the market you're going after
- Establishes what success looks like
- Identifies your "big bets" on what it takes to win
- Creates the pillars that organize your work
- Example: "A good team brain needs to always be with you (mobile), know about different kinds of work, and draw insightful connections"

### 3. Roadmap
Working backwards from your vision to validate feasibility and coordinate across the company.

- Not a commitment—it's a feasibility check
- Works backwards: "If we hit our vision in 5 years, what does year 3 look like? Year 1?"
- Reveals if your plan is realistic or needs adjustment
- Coordinates cross-functional dependencies

**Critical insight about roadmaps**: Most teams discover their roadmap reveals a 30-year timeline instead of the 5-year one they wanted. This is the value—it forces you to either take bigger swings, say no to more things, or hire more people.

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with whichever component draws you most** - Don't force a linear process. If you're excited about the vision, start there. If you have market insights, start with the strategic framework.

2. **Block dedicated time** - Take half a day with no meetings. Go to a coffee shop. Just start writing ideas for one of the three components.

3. **Collaborate early** - Share drafts with your product triad (engineering lead, design lead, key stakeholders). Real strategy is collaborative work.

4. **Use roadmaps as reality checks** - Don't treat the roadmap as a commitment. Use it to answer: "Is our vision even achievable in our desired timeframe?"

5. **Look for missing connections** - If executives give you a revenue target, that's not a complete strategy. Your job is to connect that target down through the intermediate dots to specific features.

6. **Test through communication** - You find the missing pieces by sharing your strategy and watching for confusion. When people look confused, that's where a dot is missing.

## When to Use It

- When developing or reviewing your team's strategy
- When given a high-level goal (like a revenue target) without a plan
- When you feel like the team is missing alignment
- When you've been working for ~6 months and are ready to contribute strategically
- When you're new in a role and want to build a complete picture of direction
