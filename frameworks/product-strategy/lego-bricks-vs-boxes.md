# Lego Bricks vs Lego Boxes

> "Only hardcore Lego fans care about Lego bricks. Most people care about Lego boxes. And they actually want the Lego box to be ready-made. When you unpack the box, the set is there for you." - Ivan Zhao

## What It Is

Lego Bricks vs Lego Boxes is a segmentation framework for horizontal product companies. It recognizes that different customer segments want fundamentally different things: power users want flexible building blocks (bricks), while mainstream users want pre-packaged solutions (boxes).

Ivan Zhao learned this lesson while scaling Notion from enthusiast community to enterprise market. Hardcore Notion users loved the Lego-like flexibility—they could build custom databases, wikis, and workflows from primitive blocks. But as Notion moved upmarket, they encountered a different buyer: enterprise customers who wanted "solutions" that sit on a P&L line and reduce third-party risk. These customers don't want to assemble anything—they want to unpack a ready-made set.

The framework reveals the challenge of horizontal products: you must serve brick lovers (who differentiate you) while also packaging boxes (which drive enterprise revenue). Stall too long in brick mindset, as Ivan admits Notion did, and you miss the solution opportunity. But abandon bricks entirely, and you lose what makes you special.

## How It Works

The framework maps to distinct customer segments:

**Lego Brick Buyers:**
- Power users and enthusiasts
- Want maximum flexibility and customization
- Will invest time learning the system
- Value primitives they can combine in novel ways
- Often your earliest adopters and community builders

**Lego Box Buyers:**
- Mainstream users and enterprise customers
- Want ready-made solutions for specific problems
- Won't invest time in configuration
- Value immediate time-to-value
- Need to justify purchase on specific business outcomes

The key insight is that both segments can coexist if you build the boxes from the underlying bricks. Your boxes are just pre-assembled configurations of your bricks—not separate hard-coded products. This preserves the flexibility for power users while giving mainstream customers what they need.

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your current customer mix** - What percentage are brick buyers versus box buyers? If you're 90% bricks, you may be missing enterprise revenue. If you're losing brick buyers, you may be losing your differentiation.

2. **Build boxes from bricks** - Resist the temptation to hard-code box features as separate code paths. Instead, create boxes as pre-configured assemblies of your underlying primitives. This maintains flexibility while delivering solutions.

3. **Segment your go-to-market** - Brick buyers respond to capability marketing ("you can build anything"). Box buyers respond to solution marketing ("project management for software teams"). Speak differently to each.

4. **Time the box introduction** - Don't build boxes too early (you need bricks to understand what boxes to make) or too late (Ivan regrets stalling in brick mindset too long).

5. **Protect the brick layer** - When building boxes, never compromise the underlying brick flexibility. Notion's "sprint" feature became problematic because it was hard-coded rather than built from Legos.

## When to Use It

- When deciding how to package a horizontal product for different segments
- When moving from enthusiast community to enterprise sales
- When evaluating feature requests (is this a brick or a box?)
- When your product feels too complex for mainstream users
- When enterprise customers ask for "solutions" rather than tools
