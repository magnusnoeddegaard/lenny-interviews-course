# Four Types of Product Work

> "For every great product leader, you go from being an expert in some type of product work... to now owning a portfolio of work across a bunch of different dimensions." - Fareed Mosavat

## What It Is

The Four Types of Product Work is a framework for categorizing all product development activity into four distinct categories. Originally developed by Fareed Mosavat and Casey Winters as part of Reforge's Product Strategy program, it helps product leaders understand the different kinds of work their teams do and build balanced portfolios.

Most PMs become experts in one type of product work, then struggle when they become leaders responsible for a portfolio spanning all four types. Understanding these categories helps leaders allocate resources appropriately, set the right goals, and avoid the trap of treating all product work the same way.

## How It Works

### 1. Feature Work
Adding new features, product experiences, and capabilities to drive engagement with your existing customer base. This solves a wider range of problems for current users.

**Characteristics:**
- Serves existing customers
- Deepens product usage
- Often responds to customer requests
- Success measured by engagement and satisfaction

### 2. Growth Work
Helping more customers connect with experiences you already have. This accelerates top-line growth, activation, monetization, or other key metrics.

**Characteristics:**
- Focuses on acquisition, activation, conversion
- Heavy use of experimentation
- Data-driven optimization
- Success measured by funnel metrics

### 3. PMF Expansion
Expanding product-market fit to new segments, either by taking the same product to new audiences OR adding new products to the same audience.

**Two forms:**
- **Same product, new audience:** Internationalization, new verticals, new market segments
- **New product, same audience:** Bundling strategies, adding complementary products that attract different buyers but serve the same customer base

**Characteristics:**
- Often feels like starting over
- Higher risk, higher reward
- Requires deep market understanding
- Success measured by new segment adoption

### 4. Scaling Work
Work required specifically because the product is growing. This includes technical scaling AND user scaling problems.

**Technical scaling:** Infrastructure, performance, reliability
**User scaling:** Problems that emerge at scale—trust and safety, content moderation, marketplace dynamics, abuse prevention

**Characteristics:**
- Often undervalued by PMs
- Prevents catastrophic failure
- Success measured by system stability and user trust

## How to Apply It

1. **Categorize your current work:** For each project or initiative, ask "Which of the four types is this?"

2. **Assess your portfolio balance:** Are you over-indexed on one type? Most growth-background leaders make everything a growth problem. Core product leaders may neglect scaling.

3. **Apply appropriate methods:** Each type requires different approaches:
   - Feature work: Customer research, iteration, qualitative feedback
   - Growth work: Experimentation, data analysis, funnel optimization
   - PMF expansion: Market research, discovery, high-risk bets
   - Scaling work: Technical investment, policy development, systems thinking

4. **Build generalist understanding:** Even if you came from one specialty, develop enough baseline knowledge to lead across all four types. Ask a lot of questions.

## When to Use It

- When allocating resources across your product organization
- When transitioning from IC to product leader
- When evaluating whether your portfolio is balanced
- When hiring—do you need experts in different types?
- When setting goals—are you using the right metrics for each type?

## Common Pitfall

Leaders often over-invest in their area of expertise:

> "Growth leader takes over, and everything is a growth problem. Everything is an experiment. Everything should be measured. That's not necessarily true for some of these other kinds of work."
