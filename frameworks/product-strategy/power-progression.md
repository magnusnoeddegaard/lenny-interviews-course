# Power Progression

> "There's a thing called power progression, which says there are times when certain types of power are available and the converse of that is times when they're not available." - Hamilton Helmer

## What It Is

Power Progression is the insight that sustainable competitive advantages aren't equally available at all times. Different types of power can only be established during specific phases of a company's lifecycle. Trying to build the wrong type of power at the wrong stage is futile.

This framework changed how Hamilton Helmer advises founders. He previously believed strategy was irrelevant before product-market fit, but discovered that even early-stage founders benefit from understanding which powers they're tilting toward—it shapes which business propositions to pursue.

## How It Works

The framework divides business evolution into three phases, each with different power opportunities:

### Phase 1: Origination (Pre-PMF)
**Available power**: Counter Positioning only

At this stage, you're defining your business model. The key strategic question is: "Of the business propositions you're thinking of in trying to get to product-market fit, what are the underlying characteristics that might tilt them towards the availability of power or not?"

Counter positioning is your refuge against incumbents who could otherwise easily extend their products to compete with you.

### Phase 2: Takeoff (Growth)
**Available powers**: Scale Economies, Switching Costs, Network Economies

Once you have PMF and are growing rapidly, you're in a market share battle. This is when:
- Scale economies emerge as you outgrow competitors
- Switching costs accumulate as customers invest in your product
- Network economies strengthen if your model has them

"To win at that stability phase, which is really a market share win, you have to be aware of those and understand."

### Phase 3: Stability (Maturity)
**Available powers**: Branding, Process Power

These powers only crystallize after extended market presence:
- **Branding** requires years of consistent reputation building
- **Process Power** requires deeply embedded organizational capabilities

"If you're starting a company, take those off the table. So those two are branding and process power."

### Always Excluded for Most Startups
**Cornered Resource** (patents, exclusive talent) is a special case—it's obvious when you have it and depends on circumstances rather than timing.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your current phase** - Are you finding PMF, scaling, or optimizing a stable business?

2. **Focus on available powers** - Don't waste energy on powers unavailable at your stage:
   - Pre-PMF: Evaluate business models for counter-positioning potential
   - Growth: Race to establish scale, switching costs, or network economies
   - Mature: Invest in brand and process

3. **Plan forward** - Understand what powers you're building toward:
   - "Even before you have product-market fit, it's worth thinking about strategy"
   - Ask: "Which business propositions tilt toward power availability?"

4. **Recognize phase transitions** - Strategic priorities shift as you move through phases

5. **Don't confuse activity with power** - Many growth-phase activities (UI optimization, feature development) are essential but aren't power: "If you look at the Blockbuster site, their UI site, you couldn't tell it different from Netflix. They just copied it."

## When to Use It

- Choosing between business model options pre-PMF
- Prioritizing strategic investments during growth
- Diagnosing why certain "moat" strategies aren't working
- Planning long-term competitive positioning
- Evaluating acquisition targets based on power stage
