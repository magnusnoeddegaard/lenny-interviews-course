# Focus Wisely (Target Market Clarity)

> "I think one of the harder things for companies to do. So, it sounds relatively easy, and I think most companies believe that they have clarity around this. But then when you go down into the weeds of asking someone who's product manager or a designer, I don't know that it's always as clear because there's always a bit of a hesitation to say no." - Annie Pearl

## What It Is

Focus Wisely is a strategic discipline of explicitly defining who your product is for—and who it's not for—so that individual contributors can make better prioritization decisions without escalating every trade-off.

Most companies *think* they have target market clarity, but the real test is whether a PM or designer in the weeds can confidently answer: "Should I build for User A or User B?" If they can't answer without asking leadership, you don't have true focus.

The framework recognizes that horizontal products serving many personas create prioritization paralysis. By explicitly naming your core ICPs (Ideal Customer Profiles), you enable teams to confidently deprioritize requests that don't serve those personas—even if those requests come from paying customers.

## How It Works

**The Clarity Test:**
Ask any PM or designer: "Who is our target user?"
- ❌ "We serve lots of different users..." = No focus
- ❌ "It depends on the feature..." = No focus
- ✅ "Sales teams, recruiting teams, and customer success teams in externally-facing roles" = Focus

**What True Focus Enables:**

| Without Focus | With Focus |
|---------------|------------|
| Every feature request is a trade-off debate | Clear criteria for what's in/out |
| PMs need leadership approval for priorities | PMs can decide independently |
| Build "okay" features for everyone | Build "amazing" features for target users |
| Venmo integration (many users want it) | No Venmo integration (doesn't serve core ICPs) |

**The Focus Wisely Formula:**
1. Market → Segment → Persona
2. Each level narrows the aperture
3. Document explicitly and reinforce constantly

## How to Apply It

1. **Define your target market hierarchy**:
   - Market: What broad category? (e.g., "scheduling automation")
   - Segment: Which part of that market? (e.g., "B2B teams")
   - Persona: Which specific roles? (e.g., "sales, recruiting, customer success")

2. **Embed in every artifact**:
   - Templates ask "who is the target user?"
   - PRDs require persona specification
   - Product reviews reinforce target ICP

3. **Use focus to say no explicitly**:
   - "This is a great feature for freelancers, but our focus is B2B teams"
   - Document the trade-off, not just the decision

4. **Accept beneficial side effects**:
   - Features for your core personas will often help others too
   - But don't *design* for those others

5. **Reinforce constantly**:
   - Part of onboarding
   - Repeated in all-hands
   - Built into review templates

## When to Use It

- When your product serves horizontal use cases
- When PMs struggle to prioritize feature requests
- When stakeholders constantly debate "which user matters more"
- When you're transitioning from broad PLG to focused go-to-market
- When features feel "good for everyone, great for no one"

**Warning signs you need more focus:**
- Every prioritization requires executive input
- Feature requests feel equally valid from all directions
- Your product feels like "jack of all trades"
- Teams build different things assuming different target users
