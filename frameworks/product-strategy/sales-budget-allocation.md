# Sales Budget Allocation

> "Every quarter, give your head of sales a certain budget, whether it's story points or 10% of the pie chart, however you do it, give them a budget." - Jason Lemkin

## What It Is

Sales Budget Allocation is a framework for managing the tension between product and sales. Instead of fighting over every feature request, give your VP of Sales a fixed quarterly budget (story points, percentage of engineering capacity, etc.) that they control. They decide how to spend it. Once it's gone, it's gone.

This transforms an emotional, deal-by-deal fight into an objective, strategic allocation.

## Why This Matters

**The Problem:**
- Sales requests change with the wind—HubSpot on Monday, SAP on Wednesday
- Each "must-have" feature is urgent for a big deal
- Product teams get whiplash from constant re-prioritization
- The relationship becomes adversarial

**What Budget Allocation Fixes:**
- Sales must prioritize across their requests
- Product knows what's theirs and what's committed
- Changes mid-quarter have explicit costs
- Both sides share a common framework

## How It Works

**Quarterly Cycle:**

1. **Set the budget** - "Sales gets 10% of story points this quarter"
2. **Sales prioritizes** - VP of Sales force-ranks their requests
3. **Commit and build** - Product commits to the prioritized list
4. **Track the spend** - Changes eat into the budget

**Mid-Quarter Changes:**
If sales wants to change priorities mid-quarter:
- They can, but at a cost
- Partially-built features get shelved
- Team morale impact is real
- Budget consumption accelerates

The VP of Sales learns to think strategically, not reactively.

## How to Apply It

### Setting Up the System

1. **Define the unit** - Story points, engineering weeks, % of capacity
2. **Set the allocation** - 10% is a common starting point
3. **Make it visible** - Both teams see the budget and spend
4. **Review weekly** - "Here's what we're building for you, here's what's left"

### Sales Responsibility

5. **Force rank ruthlessly** - Can't have everything; what's #1?
6. **Listen across the team** - Collect input from all reps
7. **Think quarters ahead** - What do we need in Q3, not just today?
8. **Accept tradeoffs** - HubSpot means no SAP this quarter

### Product Responsibility

9. **Honor the budget** - Sales owns their allocation
10. **Be objective** - Track spend transparently
11. **Flag true costs** - If a change is expensive, say so
12. **Don't sandbag** - Give honest effort estimates

## The Weekly Ritual

Product and VP of Sales should meet weekly with three views:

1. **What's being built now** (from sales budget)
2. **What's planned for this quarter** (committed)
3. **What's in queue for next quarters** (tentative)

This meeting lets sales adjust before commitments are made, not after.

## What Changes

**Before:**
- Every deal triggers a fire drill
- Product feels like order-takers
- Sales feels ignored when told "no"
- Roadmap is unpredictable

**After:**
- Sales sees the tradeoffs they control
- Product plans with confidence
- Changes are explicit decisions, not emergencies
- Both sides feel heard

## The VP of Sales Learns to Load Balance

Something magical happens when sales owns a budget:

> "If you say, 'Okay Lenny, my VP of Sales, great. You've got 100 story points. You've got to decide now each quarter.'"

They'll:
- Actually talk to their team about priorities
- Realize the HubSpot integration isn't worth it
- Think 12 months ahead, not 12 days
- Protect the budget for what really matters

## When Sales Wins Big

In best-run organizations, the VP of Product *also* meets customers. This creates shared context:

- Product learns what customers actually need
- Sales sees what's technically possible
- Both contribute to prioritization
- The budget becomes a tool, not a weapon
