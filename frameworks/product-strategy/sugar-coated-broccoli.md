# Sugar-Coated Broccoli

> "People don't want to eat the broccoli but people like sugar, so give them the sugar then hide the broccoli inside of it." - Ivan Zhao

## What It Is

Sugar-Coated Broccoli is the strategy of packaging your ambitious vision inside a familiar form factor that people already understand and want. Your "broccoli" is the transformative idea you want to bring to the world. The "sugar" is the product category people are already searching for.

Ivan Zhao and the Notion team spent their first two years trying to build a developer tool that would let everyone create software—their core vision. Nobody cared. Most people don't wake up wanting to build software. They wake up with a report due and tasks to complete.

The breakthrough came when they realized they could hide their vision (everyone can create software) inside productivity software—a category people use every day. Notion appears to be a notes and docs tool, but underneath it has no-code developer power that lets users build almost any kind of productivity software. People came for the familiar sugar (productivity suite) and gradually discovered the hidden broccoli (Lego-like building blocks for custom software).

## How It Works

The framework operates on a simple truth: the world is not like you. Users don't care about your vision or philosophy—they care about solving their immediate problems. Sugar-Coated Broccoli works by:

1. **Identifying what people already want**: Find a category with existing demand that overlaps with your vision's domain
2. **Packaging your vision inside it**: Make your product appear to be a better version of what they're already searching for
3. **Progressive discovery**: Let users gradually discover the deeper capabilities as they use the product more

The sugar gets you in the door. The broccoli creates the lasting differentiation and value once they're inside.

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your vision honestly** - Is your core idea something the mainstream already wants, or something you think they should want? If it's the latter, you need to find sugar.

2. **Map adjacent categories** - What product categories do your target users already use daily? Which ones overlap with your vision's domain?

3. **Find the sugar coating** - Design your product's entry point around the familiar category. Make the first experience feel like what users expect, not like your revolutionary vision.

4. **Layer the broccoli underneath** - Build your differentiated capabilities in ways users can discover organically as they go deeper. Don't force the broccoli on day one.

5. **Trust the gradual reveal** - Users who came for productivity software will discover the building-block power over time. Some will just use the sugar, and that's okay too.

## When to Use It

- When your vision is too abstract or unfamiliar for mainstream adoption
- When initial attempts to pitch your full vision failed to resonate
- When you're building something genuinely new that has no obvious category
- When users keep saying "I don't get it" despite your best explanations
- When you have a transformative idea but need a distribution strategy
