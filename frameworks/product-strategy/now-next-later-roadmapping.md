# Now Next Later Roadmapping

> "The whole beef with the timeline roadmap is just taking apart the concept of the timeline. It doesn't mean we live in la la land. It doesn't mean that we don't believe in having dates on the roadmap, if there is a date that we have to work towards. It just means not penalizing ourselves by having a date on everything on the roadmap." - Janna Bastow

## What It Is

Now Next Later is a roadmapping framework that replaces traditional timeline-based Gantt charts with three simple time-horizon buckets. Instead of assigning specific dates to every item, you organize work by relative priority and certainty: what you're working on now, what's coming next, and what you'll tackle later.

The framework emerged from a simple observation: no one was actually delivering roadmaps on time. When Janna Bastow and her team built early roadmapping tools, they discovered that the most requested feature was the ability to "move everything by a month." This revealed that timeline roadmaps were fundamentally broken - they promised precision that didn't exist.

By removing the timeline axis, Now Next Later acknowledges the cone of uncertainty: things get less certain the further out you plan. The format provides flexibility while still communicating direction and priorities.

## How It Works

**Three Buckets:**

1. **Now** - Work currently in progress. These items are well-defined, actively being built, and typically weeks away from completion. Highest certainty and detail.

2. **Next** - Items that are prioritized and ready to start soon. They've been validated through discovery but aren't yet in active development. Medium certainty.

3. **Later** - Future work that's directionally important but needs more refinement. Low certainty and intentionally vague on timing.

**Key Principles:**

- Items can still have dates when genuinely needed (regulatory deadlines, seasonal requirements)
- The further right on the roadmap, the less detailed and committed the items should be
- Focus on problems to solve, not features to build
- The roadmap should be shareable with customers and stakeholders without creating false promises

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with problems, not features** - Frame roadmap items as problems you're solving rather than features you're building. This maintains flexibility in implementation.

2. **Remove arbitrary dates** - Only add dates to items with genuine external deadlines (regulatory requirements, seasonal launches, customer commitments).

3. **Maintain regular communication** - Hold launch readiness meetings so stakeholders can see what's in the "now" column and understand what's imminent.

4. **Use the format to protect the team** - When stakeholders ask "when will X be done?", the format shifts the conversation to "X is in our 'next' bucket" rather than defending missed dates.

5. **Review and adjust continuously** - The roadmap is a living document. Items move between buckets as priorities shift and new information emerges.

## When to Use It

- When your team consistently misses roadmap deadlines
- When stakeholders treat estimated dates as promises
- When you want to embrace agile principles but still need to communicate direction
- When you need a roadmap format that can be shared externally without creating liability
- When you want to reduce planning overhead and time spent on false precision

## When It May Not Fit

- Highly regulated environments where every deliverable must have committed dates
- Hardware development with long lead times and fixed production schedules
- Contractual obligations that require specific delivery dates
