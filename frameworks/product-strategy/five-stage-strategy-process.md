# Five-Stage Strategy Process

> "I started noticing that there was a certain mystique and aura about product strategy. There was this perception that some people were intrinsically really good at strategy and others were not. It was almost as if there was a strategy gene you needed to be born with to be good at it. And that bothered me a lot... I have news for you. The answer is yes, anybody can build product strategy through a clear understanding of what it is and through a friendly and repeatable playbook." - Chandra Janakiraman

## What It Is

This is an operator's guide to developing product strategy—a procedural approach that makes strategy formulation accessible to anyone, not just those perceived to have a "strategy gene." The process synthesizes ideas from Good Strategy Bad Strategy, Playing to Win, Michael Porter, and other strategy classics into a friendly, repeatable 8-12 week playbook.

Product strategy sits between mission/vision at the top and the roadmap/plan at the bottom. It forces choice to deploy scarce resources toward maximum impact. A complete strategy includes three components: a handful of areas to focus on (strategic pillars), several areas that are explicitly NOT the focus, and the reasoning why.

The process works because it builds alignment throughout—both within the team and with leadership. Something that comes from the team collectively feels more familiar and easier to accept than a strategy document written in isolation by one PM.

## How It Works

The process has five distinct phases over 8-12 weeks:

### Phase 1: Preparation (4 weeks)
Form a **Strategy Working Group** with engineering, product, design, and data at minimum. The PM drives the process, but everyone contributes:

1. **Behavioral Insights Meta-Analysis**: Data person synthesizes all historical analysis into macro themes
2. **UXR Insights Meta-Analysis**: Design person compiles user research, customer service feedback, and social signals
3. **Leadership Interviews**: Ask leaders "What does success feel like? What does failure look like? What are your pet ideas?"
4. **Competitive Analysis**: Head-to-head comparisons and investment themes from competitors' releases
5. **Adjacent Roadmaps**: What are teams near you building?
6. **User Observation**: Each working group member watches users or interviews one—to build empathy

Output: A comprehensive preparation readout deck synthesizing all inputs.

### Phase 2: Strategy Sprint (1 week)
This is the heart of the process where you make the choice.

**Day 1 - Share Out**: Everyone presents their preparation work. Others take notes on problems holding the product back.

**Day 2 - Strategic Pillar Selection**:
1. Generate all problems freely (expect 50+)
2. Cluster related problems into 10-15 groups
3. Flip each problem cluster into an opportunity framing (e.g., "Difficulty finding things" → "Discovery")
4. Rank each opportunity on four criteria: Expected Impact, Certainty of Impact, Clarity of Levers, Differentiation
5. Select top 3 as your strategic pillars
6. Generate "How Might We" questions for each pillar

**Day 3 - Winning Aspiration**:
Use the newspaper headline approach—imagine a journalist writes about your success in 2 years. Everyone writes headlines independently, then blend them into one winning aspiration.

### Phase 3: Design Sprint (1 week)
Design leads this phase. Input: strategic pillars and how-might-we questions. Output: illustrative concepts that bring the strategy to life.

The goal is NOT feature-ready designs—it's generating concepts that show what each pillar could look like. A picture is worth a thousand words for getting alignment.

### Phase 4: Document Writing (1-2 weeks)
The PM writes the strategy document solo, weaving together all the inputs. Template sections:
- Broader context (what leaders want)
- Key insights and analysis
- Strategic pillars with illustrative concepts
- Winning aspiration
- Alignment questions
- Appendix: Full prioritization table with criteria

Keep it to 3-4 pages plus appendix. Do NOT include a roadmap—strategy is a companion to the roadmap, not the roadmap itself.

### Phase 5: Rollout (2-3 weeks)
1. **Gatekeepers**: 1:1 meetings with 2-3 critical approvers
2. **Key Stakeholders**: Group review or async sharing with functional leaders
3. **Team Roadshows**: Sessions of 8-10 people for conversational Q&A

The purpose is to land the strategy, not seek major changes. The full prioritization table in the appendix defends your choices—if someone wants to change it, they need to argue against the criteria and scoring.

## How to Apply It

1. **Set expectations upfront**: The process takes 8-12 weeks, but the strategy can be leveraged for 2 years—healthy ROI
2. **Form your working group**: Get commitment from engineering, design, and data leads to participate
3. **Run preparation in parallel with day jobs**: This phase doesn't require full-time dedication
4. **Protect Day 2 of the strategy sprint**: This is the most critical day—make sure everyone can focus
5. **Let designers lead the design sprint**: PM can step back while design generates concepts
6. **Keep your manager aligned throughout**: Quick syncs after major milestones, not just at rollout
7. **Don't include resourcing**: That's a roadmap question, not a strategy question

## When to Use It

- You've received feedback that people don't understand why you're working on what you're working on
- You're starting a new product or major initiative
- Your team lacks strategic clarity and is spreading effort too thin
- You need defensible criteria for prioritization decisions
- You want to build alignment before building the roadmap

**Time horizon**: This "small s" strategy process is designed for 18-24 month horizons. For longer-term (5-10 year) visionary work, use the "Big S" strategy process instead.
