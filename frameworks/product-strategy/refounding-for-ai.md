# Refounding for AI

> "If you were literally founding a new company from scratch with the same mission, how would you execute on that mission using a fully AI native approach? And then, by the way, do you have useful building blocks that you can leverage from your existing product and your existing business, or are you literally worse off having this legacy asset versus starting something from scratch? ...If you can't really introspect and say, 'Look, I think I'm better off doing this with the pieces that I have for my existing business and product,' then I think you should sell." - Howie Liu

## What It Is

Refounding for AI is a strategic framework for established companies navigating the AI transition. Rather than incrementally adding AI features, it asks founders to take a "clean slate" approach: imagine founding the company today with the same mission—how would you execute with fully AI-native capabilities?

The framework then asks a critical follow-up: do your existing assets (product, customers, data, expertise) give you an advantage in that AI-native vision, or are they actually baggage?

## How It Works

**Step 1: Define Your Mission**
Strip away your current product and ask: what problem are we fundamentally solving? What value do we create for users?

**Step 2: Reimagine from Scratch**
If you were founding today, with access to current AI capabilities:
- What would the product look like?
- How would users interact with it?
- What would the go-to-market be?
- What business model would make sense?

**Step 3: Audit Your Assets**
Do your existing assets help or hurt?

| Asset Type | Potential Advantage | Potential Baggage |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Product | Building blocks, proven components | Technical debt, rigid architecture |
| Customers | Distribution, trust, feedback | Expectations, migration burden |
| Data | Training data, insights | Privacy constraints, quality issues |
| Team | Domain expertise, execution ability | Mindset, skill gaps |

**Step 4: Make the Hard Call**
Three possible conclusions:
1. **Refound with leverage** - Your assets give you an advantage; lean into AI-native transformation
2. **Refound without leverage** - Start a separate AI-native initiative
3. **Exit and restart** - Your legacy is baggage; sell and start fresh if you truly believe in the mission

## How to Apply It

Steps for refounding your company for AI:

1. **Schedule a clean-slate session** - Block time to imagine founding today without any existing constraints
2. **Study AI-native competitors** - How would Cursor, Perplexity, or other AI-native companies approach your mission?
3. **Audit your building blocks** - List everything you have and honestly assess if each helps or hurts
4. **Test the thesis** - Build a prototype of the AI-native vision and see if your assets actually accelerate it
5. **Make the call** - Decide if you're refounding with leverage, parallel-pathing, or something else entirely

## When to Use It

This framework is critical when:

- AI fundamentally changes what's possible in your product domain
- You see AI-native startups threatening your market
- Your team is asking "how should we think about AI?"
- You're planning multi-year strategy

It's not a good fit if:
- AI is tangential to your core value proposition
- You're in a stable market with low AI disruption potential
- You lack the resources to execute on any transformation
