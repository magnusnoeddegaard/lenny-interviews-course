# Irreducible Complexity (One Plus One Equals One and a Half)

> "One plus one does not equal three, it sometimes equals one and a half. And the more that you add and the more that you continue to put in something, the more complex it gets and the worse it gets." - Dylan Field

## What It Is

A mental model for understanding why adding features often makes products worse, not better. In tools and software, each addition doesn't just add its own complexity—it interacts with everything else, creating emergent complexity that degrades the overall experience.

The term "irreducible complexity" captures the idea that this complexity cannot be easily removed once introduced. You can make "all the right local decisions" and still end up with something that "together is too complex and not working anymore."

This is Figma's guiding principle for why simplification requires constant vigilance.

## How It Works

**The Math of Features:**

- 1 feature = 1 unit of value, ~1 unit of complexity
- 2 features = ~1.5 units of value (not 2), ~2.5 units of complexity
- 3 features = ~1.8 units of value, ~5 units of complexity
- And so on...

**Why This Happens:**

1. **Interaction effects** - Each new feature must work with all existing features, creating exponential interaction complexity

2. **Cognitive load** - Users must understand more to use the product effectively

3. **Loss of coherence** - The product's conceptual model becomes harder to grasp

4. **Maintenance burden** - Every feature must be maintained, updated, and tested against everything else

## How to Apply It

1. **Question every addition** - Before adding a feature, ask: "Does this make the product more powerful WITHOUT making it more complex?" This is "extremely hard" but essential.

2. **Revisit the system** - When you notice "this thing is too complex as a system," go back and reconsider the architecture, not just individual features. Sometimes Pages work even if Dylan is "skeptical of them."

3. **Accept simplification as leadership work** - Per Dylan: "Furrow your brow and insist there must be something simpler." This isn't perfectionism—it's essential maintenance.

4. **Track systemic complexity** - Watch for the moment when local decisions that each seemed right combine into something unwieldy.

5. **Be willing to remove** - If you've accumulated complexity, the only fix is removal, not addition. This is painful but necessary.

## The Simplicity Principle

Dylan pairs this with another guiding principle:

> "Keep the simple things simple. Make the complex things possible."

This suggests the goal isn't to eliminate all complexity—it's to ensure that:
- Common tasks stay simple despite product growth
- Power features are available but don't pollute the basic experience

## When to Use It

- Evaluating whether to add a new feature
- Explaining why a "simple addition" will actually be complex
- Reviewing products that feel bloated despite each feature being reasonable
- Deciding whether to simplify vs. add more
- Communicating with stakeholders who want "just one more feature"
