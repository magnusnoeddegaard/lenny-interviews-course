# Connecting the Dots Strategy

> "A good strategy is all about connecting the dots. Connecting the dots from this high level business goal of 'We want to increase revenue by this much' to 'This is the feature we're going to do.' And it might have many, many dots in between to help get people from one to the other." - Jackie Bavaro

## What It Is

Jackie Bavaro developed this mental model after repeatedly encountering PMs who were confused when executives handed them numerical targets (like "increase revenue by 50%") and called it strategy. Her insight: a revenue target alone isn't strategy—it's missing all the intermediate reasoning that connects the goal to specific actions.

The framework views strategy as a chain of connected logical steps. Each "dot" represents a strategic choice or assumption. When any dots are missing, people get confused about why the team is doing what they're doing.

## How It Works

### The Chain of Dots

1. **High-level business goal** → "Increase revenue by 50%"
2. **Strategic insight** → "It's easier to get more from current users than win new ones because we're saturated"
3. **Strategic bet** → "We'll focus on expanding usage among existing customers"
4. **Approach** → "Help power users share with their teams"
5. **Solution area** → "Team collaboration features"
6. **Specific feature** → "Shared workspaces with activity feeds"

### Finding Missing Dots

Missing dots show up as confusion. When you communicate your strategy and people look confused or ask questions that seem obvious to you, that's a signal there's a dot missing between their understanding and yours.

### The PM's Job

When you receive a high-level target (revenue goal, user growth number), your job is to:

1. Take the product insights you've gathered (customer research, data analysis, market understanding)
2. Connect them upward to the business goal
3. Make explicit the reasoning at each level

## How to Apply It

1. **Start from both ends** - Take your business goal AND your feature ideas. Work to connect them through intermediate reasoning.

2. **Write down each assumption** - "We think it's better to focus on existing users because..." Every "because" is a dot.

3. **Test through communication** - Share your strategy chain with others. Watch carefully for confusion—it reveals missing dots.

4. **Listen past politeness** - "People will try to hide their confusion. They won't get your strategy, there's going to be some assumption that you're making that they are not making."

5. **Add alternatives at key decision points** - At major dots, show what other options you considered: "We could focus on new markets OR existing users. Here's why we chose existing users..."

6. **Keep asking "why"** - If someone asks "why are we building X?", trace the chain back up to the business goal.

## When to Use It

- When given a revenue target or OKR as "strategy"
- When explaining prioritization decisions
- When team members question why certain features are important
- When onboarding new team members to your strategy
- When creating strategy presentations for leadership

## Example Application

**Received goal**: "Increase enterprise revenue by 40%"

**Missing dots to fill in**:
- Why enterprise specifically? → "Enterprise has higher LTV and we're underperforming vs. competitors there"
- What do enterprises need that we lack? → "Security certifications and admin controls based on lost deals analysis"
- How do we win deals? → "POCs with IT decision-makers, not individual users"
- What features enable this? → "SSO integration, audit logs, role-based permissions"

Now each feature connects all the way back to the goal through explicit reasoning.
