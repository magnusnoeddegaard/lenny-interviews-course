# Design for Someone Not Everyone

> "My design mantra is always design something for someone. It is very hard to design everything for everyone because you just end up with a very generalized solution. So then what we are trying to do with the opinionated solution is that that's the best solution or at the most optimized solution we think of." - Karri Saarinen

## What It Is

Design for Someone Not Everyone is a product design philosophy that prioritizes creating optimal experiences for specific user types rather than trying to satisfy everyone with a compromised, generalized solution.

The core insight is that attempting to design for everyone leads to mediocrity. When you try to accommodate all possible users and use cases, you make trade-offs that weaken the experience for everyone. By contrast, designing specifically for a defined audience allows you to create something truly excellent for that group.

This approach is central to how Linear builds product—they make deliberate choices about who they're building for, knowing that some users won't be a good fit, but those who are will have a significantly better experience.

## How It Works

The framework operates on several principles:

**1. Specificity Enables Excellence**
- Generic solutions require compromises at every decision point
- Specific solutions can optimize for what matters to the target user
- The result is a product that feels "made for me" to the right users

**2. Trade-offs Are Explicit**
- Designing for someone means deliberately not designing for others
- These trade-offs should be conscious and strategic
- Not every user complaint warrants a product change

**3. Opinions Create Focus**
- When you know who you're designing for, decisions become clearer
- The target user's needs become the tiebreaker in product debates
- This reduces endless optimization for edge cases

**4. Better for Some > Okay for All**
- A product loved by 1,000 users beats one tolerated by 10,000
- Strong product-market fit requires specificity
- Word of mouth comes from users who feel understood

## How to Apply It

1. **Define your "someone" clearly** - Create a specific profile of your ideal user. What are their goals? Their context? Their values? For Linear, this was "technical teams that care about quality and speed."

2. **Make design decisions from their perspective** - When evaluating options, ask: "What would our target user want?" not "What would satisfy the most users?"

3. **Accept you'll lose some users** - If everyone loves your product equally, you probably haven't made strong enough choices. Some users should find your product not for them.

4. **Use specificity to inform prioritization** - When features are requested, evaluate whether they serve your target user. It's okay to say no to features that would dilute the experience for your core audience.

5. **Test with your target users** - When gathering feedback, weight input from your target users more heavily than from adjacent users who aren't the primary audience.

## When to Use It

**Most valuable when:**
- Building products in crowded markets where differentiation matters
- Creating tools for professional/power users
- Companies that want to build a strong brand and community
- Early-stage products seeking product-market fit
- Opinionated products that take a stance on how work should be done

**Tension points:**
- This approach can limit initial market size
- Some businesses need broad appeal (marketplaces, networks)
- Later-stage companies may need to expand beyond their initial target

**The Linear example:**
Linear explicitly designs for "software companies and technical teams that care about quality." This specificity means they don't try to serve every possible project management use case—they optimize for developers and engineering-driven product teams.
