# Execution Over Strategy (Early Stage)

> "When you are a small startup, strategy does not matter because there's not that much strategy as about. Maybe later on you might be fruitful to think about strategy, but strategy kind of assumes that you can do multiple things at the same time, which small startups cannot. They can just do one thing at the same time." - Gustaf Alstromer

## What It Is

Execution Over Strategy is Gustaf Alstromer's framework for understanding why early-stage startups should focus almost entirely on execution rather than strategic planning. The core insight is that strategy is only relevant when you have multiple viable paths to choose between. Pre-product-market-fit, you don't have that luxury - there's only one thing to work on at a time.

Strategy discussions at this stage are often procrastination disguised as work.

## How It Works

### Why Strategy Exists in Big Companies

Gustaf explains the origin of "strategy talk":

"The reason that we talk about strategy a lot is because it goes back to business school. The origin of business school was to teach people to join the corporate world. And in the corporate world, strategy matters."

In large companies:
- Multiple business units compete for resources
- Trade-offs between markets and products exist
- Long-term positioning affects competitive dynamics
- You actually CAN do multiple things simultaneously

### Why Strategy Doesn't Apply Early

Small startups:
- Can only do one thing at a time
- Don't have product-market fit yet
- Should be focused on customers, not competitors
- Need to learn, not plan

"Strategy also assumes that you have product market fit because you already have something that's working. If you don't have that, then getting to people wanting your product, that is your strategy. You don't have any other strategy."

### Strategy as Symptom

When someone wants to have a "strategy session" at an early stage:

"It assumes that they don't understand their priorities. The priorities is always a list from top to bottom where there's one thing that's more important than the others."

If you know your priority, you don't need strategy. You need execution.

## How to Apply It

### When Strategy Urges Arise

Redirect to execution:
1. **What is the #1 thing we should be doing right now?**
2. **Are we doing that thing?**
3. **If not, why not?**
4. **If yes, how do we do it faster?**

### Replace Strategy Meetings

Instead of "Let's discuss our Q3 strategy":
- "Let's review our customer conversations from this week"
- "Let's identify what's blocking us from more customer calls"
- "Let's figure out why the last 5 prospects said no"

### The One Priority Test

If you can't answer "What is the single most important thing to work on?" with one clear answer:
- You have a prioritization problem, not a strategy problem
- The answer is probably "talk to more customers"
- Strategy discussions won't help; customer feedback will

### When Strategy Becomes Relevant

Strategy matters when:
- You have product-market fit
- You have resources to allocate across initiatives
- You face genuine trade-offs between viable paths
- Competitive positioning actually matters

Until then, execute.

## The Priorities Framework

Gustaf describes the healthy alternative to strategy:

"The priorities is always a list from top to bottom where there's one thing that's more important than the others. You can't really have a strategy session about the other things because there's only one thing to work on."

A proper priority list:
1. Talk to customers / find product-market fit
2. (Nothing else matters until #1 is done)

## When to Use It

- **When tempted to discuss "strategy"** - Ask if you have PMF first
- **When planning feels more comfortable than doing** - Execute instead
- **When the team debates positioning** - Talk to customers instead
- **When advisors push for strategy decks** - Politely refocus on execution

## The Business School Trap

Many founders come from business school or consulting where strategy is the currency. Gustaf warns this background can be counterproductive:

Strategy work in big companies is valuable because choices exist. Early-stage startups don't have choices - they have one imperative: find product-market fit by talking to customers.

Applying corporate strategy frameworks to pre-PMF startups is like using a map for a city you haven't arrived at yet.
