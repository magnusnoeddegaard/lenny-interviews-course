# Reach for the Stars, Land on the Moon

> "I think we have to fight against that. And the way I look at it is, the way I talk about it is reach for the stars and land on the moon. What I mean by that is that vision work is really important... Looking at it as a journey. It's not the five-star approach, it's not the six-star approach, but the 11-star approach, but show what that ideal version is, because if you don't know what that is, what are the chances that you're going to increment yourself to the right outcome in the end?" - Katie Dill

## What It Is

Companies, especially as they grow, develop a fear of bold ideas. Incremental changes feel safer—they're easier to measure, fit within quarterly goals, and have predictable outcomes. But this incrementalism is dangerous because small steps rarely lead to transformative outcomes.

"Reach for the Stars, Land on the Moon" is a call to do vision work that shows the ideal end state—the 11-star experience—and then work backwards from there. You may not ship the whole vision at once, but knowing what "great" looks like lets you sequence work intelligently.

The key insight is that vision work shouldn't be beautiful decks that gather dust. Instead, it should be a North Star that guides incremental execution, ensuring all the small steps actually lead somewhere coherent.

## How It Works

**The Problem:**
- Big ideas are hard to measure
- Incremental changes are seductive because they're predictable
- Teams focus on what they can ship in a quarter
- Performance incentives favor small, measurable wins
- Without a destination, you increment toward nothing

**The Solution:**
1. Create vision work showing the comprehensive, ideal experience
2. Consider the entire journey, not isolated features
3. Show how all the pieces fit together (like an architect's plans)
4. Work backwards to sequence what gets built when
5. Ship incrementally toward the vision, measuring as you go

**Why it works:**
You don't have to ship the whole thing at once. The vision tells you whether this quarter's work moves you toward greatness or just sideways. It prevents the patchwork product that emerges from uncoordinated incrementalism.

## How to Apply It

1. **Invest in vision design** - Allocate resources to show what the ideal product looks like in 2+ years, not just next quarter.

2. **Think in journeys** - Vision work should cover entire user journeys, not isolated features. Users don't experience your product in silos.

3. **Use vision to coordinate teams** - Like house plans, your vision shows how different teams' work fits together.

4. **Ship incrementally WITH the vision** - "We're shipping this piece first to learn X before building Y." The vision guides prioritization.

5. **Make vision work actionable** - Visions that sit in decks are useless. Connect vision to roadmaps and quarterly plans.

6. **Fight incrementalism explicitly** - When someone proposes only small changes, ask: "Where does this lead? What's the ideal state we're working toward?"

## When to Use It

- When a product has become a patchwork of uncoordinated changes
- When teams are shipping features that don't add up to a coherent experience
- When you're fighting against incrementalism culture
- During planning to align on direction before debating details
- When onboarding new team members to show where you're headed
