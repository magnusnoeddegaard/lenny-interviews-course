# Software as Content

> "Software is becoming content. There's going to be other forms of software that don't look like the software today, but you can run, start and run as a business." - Dan Shipper

## What It Is

Software as Content describes a fundamental shift in how software is created and distributed in the AI era. Just as the internet transformed media from expensive productions (Hollywood movies) to abundant content anyone can create (YouTube videos), AI is doing the same to software.

Previously, building software required significant engineering investment and technical skill. Now, with AI tools, software can be created much more rapidly and cheaply. This enables new forms of "content-like" software: DIA skills, custom GPTs, prompts, automations, and lightweight tools that are more personal, more abundant, and more specialized than traditional SaaS applications.

The comparison to YouTube vs. Hollywood is intentional. YouTube didn't replace Hollywood—both exist. But it created an entirely new category of creators and businesses that didn't exist before. Similarly, AI-enabled "software content" won't replace enterprise SaaS, but will create new opportunities for individuals and small teams.

## How It Works

The framework highlights key differences between traditional software and software-as-content:

| Traditional Software | Software as Content |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Years to build | Days or hours to build |
| Requires engineers | Accessible to non-technical creators |
| One product for many users | Many variations for niche audiences |
| Large company distribution | Individual or small team distribution |
| Subscription/license model | Part of content bundles or free |
| Examples: Salesforce, Notion | Examples: Custom GPTs, DIA skills, prompts |

The shift is enabled by:
- AI coding tools reducing development cost 10-100x
- Platforms that host lightweight apps (ChatGPT, DIA, etc.)
- User expectations for more personalized, specialized tools

## How to Apply It

1. **Find your ChatGPT workflow** - What do you use AI for repeatedly? That workflow might be a "content software" product for others who have the same need.

2. **Think niche, not scale** - Software-as-content doesn't need millions of users. A valuable prompt or custom GPT for a specific audience can be a viable product.

3. **Bundle software with content** - Like Every bundles their apps with their newsletter, consider how software can enhance content offerings or vice versa.

4. **Embrace iteration** - Content gets shipped and improved fast. Software-as-content should too. Don't over-engineer what could be a prompt or simple tool.

5. **Watch for platform opportunities** - New platforms like DIA skills, custom GPTs, and AI marketplaces are early. Being early on distribution platforms historically creates opportunity.

## When to Use It

- When exploring new product ideas enabled by AI
- When deciding between building traditional software vs. lighter-weight tools
- When thinking about how to differentiate in crowded software markets
- When considering bundling strategies for media/content businesses
- When evaluating opportunities for non-technical founders
