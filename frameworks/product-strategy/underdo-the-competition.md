# Underdo the Competition

> "You don't need to outdo the competition, it's expensive and defensive. Underdo your competition. We need more simplicity and clarity." - Jason Fried

## What It Is

Underdo the Competition is a counter-intuitive competitive strategy: instead of matching or exceeding competitors' feature sets, deliberately do less. Build simpler products. Serve fewer use cases. Have fewer options. Make fewer promises.

This works because feature expansion tends to create complexity, which creates confusion, which creates user frustration. While competitors race to add features, underdoing creates space for clarity and focus. You're not playing their game—you're playing a different game entirely.

The strategy is defensive only in appearance. It's actually offensive positioning that most competitors can't copy because their entire business model is built on "more." Underdoing requires a different set of capabilities: editing, saying no, maintaining focus, accepting smaller markets.

## How It Works

**Traditional Competitive Thinking**:
- Competitor has feature X, we need feature X
- They're targeting Enterprise, we should too
- They have 5 pricing tiers, maybe we need 6
- Every request is a potential feature
- More = better

**Underdo Thinking**:
- Competitor has feature X, we'll skip it
- They're targeting Enterprise, we'll stay with SMB
- They have 5 tiers, we'll have 1 or 2
- Most requests are distractions from our core
- Less = clearer

**Why This Works**:
- Complexity has costs that compound over time
- Every feature adds maintenance, documentation, support load
- Users don't need everything—they need the right things done well
- "Does less" can mean "does core things better"
- Simpler products are easier to learn, use, and switch to

## How to Apply It

1. **Define your core**: What are the essential things you do? Do those exceptionally well.

2. **Say no by default**: When asked for a feature competitors have, default answer is no unless it serves your core.

3. **Remove, don't just stop adding**: Actively look for features to kill, not just features to not build.

4. **Embrace smaller scope**: "We're not for everyone" is a feature, not a limitation.

5. **Simplify pricing**: If competitors have complex pricing, use radical simplicity as differentiation.

6. **Focus on the 80-20**: Most users use a small fraction of features. Nail that fraction.

## When to Use It

- Competing against established players with mature products
- When your market is suffering from feature bloat
- Building products for underserved "simple needs" segments
- Bootstrap businesses that can't match enterprise resources
- Any time "more" has become a competitive arms race
