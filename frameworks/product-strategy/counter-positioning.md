# Counter Positioning

> "Almost every startup that you want to deal with starts with counter positioning because... you are coming up with a way to satisfy a more or less existing need in a novel way that creates more value." - Hamilton Helmer

## What It Is

Counter positioning occurs when a startup adopts a business model that an incumbent cannot copy without damaging their existing business. It's the primary source of power available to early-stage companies and provides refuge from well-resourced competitors who could otherwise easily replicate your product.

Unlike "disruption" in the generic sense, counter positioning is precise: the incumbent rationally chooses not to respond because doing so would cannibalize their current profitable business. This isn't about them being slow or stupid—it's about them being rational.

## How It Works

Counter positioning works because you create a structural conflict for the incumbent:

**The Startup Advantage**: You have nothing to lose. Your new business model serves customers better in some dimension (often price, convenience, or experience).

**The Incumbent Dilemma**: To compete with you, they would need to:
- Cannibalize existing revenue streams
- Retrain or displace existing employees
- Abandon established supplier/partner relationships
- Undermine their current value proposition to customers

**The Rational Response**: Incumbents often make the rational choice to defend their existing business rather than adopt yours. By the time your model is obviously superior, you've built other powers (scale, switching costs, network effects).

### Examples

- **Netflix vs Blockbuster**: Netflix's streaming model required Blockbuster to abandon late fees (major revenue) and physical stores (major assets). Even when Blockbuster tried to respond, they couldn't commit fully.

- **Amazon vs Brick-and-Mortar**: Amazon's e-commerce model offered lower prices and infinite selection. Traditional retailers couldn't match prices without destroying store economics.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your functional competition** - "Remember what product market fit primarily is—a substitution. You are coming up with a way to satisfy a more or less existing need in a novel way."

2. **Analyze the incumbent's business model** - What are their key revenue drivers? What are their major cost structures? What relationships are they dependent on?

3. **Find the conflict** - What would the incumbent have to sacrifice to adopt your model?
   - Revenue streams they'd cannibalize
   - Assets they'd need to abandon
   - Capabilities that would become liabilities

4. **Make the conflict real** - Your model should force a genuine either/or choice, not just an "and" addition

5. **Build other powers during the window** - Counter positioning buys you time. Use it to establish scale economies, switching costs, or network effects before incumbents decide to respond.

## When to Use It

- Evaluating business model options pre-PMF
- Stress-testing whether incumbents can easily copy you
- Explaining to investors why well-funded competitors won't crush you
- Choosing which market segments to enter first

## Common Mistakes

**Assuming incumbents are slow or dumb**: Counter positioning isn't about incumbent incompetence. Smart incumbents rationally choose not to respond. If an incumbent could adopt your model without pain, you don't have counter positioning.

**Confusing being different with being counter-positioned**: Many startups are different but easily copied. Counter positioning requires a genuine business model conflict for the incumbent.

**Forgetting to build other powers**: Counter positioning provides a window, not permanent protection. "You go into the other three types of power—scale economies, switching costs and network economies—and those depend on your scale relative to competitors."
