# Magic Triangle (Product, Company, Category)

> "In order to build a legendary company, you've got to get product, company, and category right at the right time. Product, company, and category are equal in importance." — Christopher Lochhead

## What It Is

The Magic Triangle is a framework that identifies the three essential elements that must be designed together to build a legendary company: Product, Company, and Category. Most entrepreneurs focus almost exclusively on product, believing that superior products win markets. The Magic Triangle reframes this—product is necessary but not sufficient. You also need to design your company (culture, business model, operations) and your category (the market space your product lives in).

The key insight is that all three are equally important. Products fail not because they're bad, but because they don't have a category designed around them. Great categories can't be dominated without strong products. And neither succeeds without a company capable of executing.

## How It Works

**The Three Vertices**:

1. **Product**: What you build—the technology, features, user experience, and value you deliver. This is where most entrepreneurs focus 90%+ of their attention.

2. **Company**: How you organize to build and deliver the product—culture, team, business model, operations, and go-to-market capabilities.

3. **Category**: The market space your product exists in—the problem framing, language, competitive dynamics, and mental scaffolding that determines how customers perceive your value.

**Why All Three Matter**:
- Great products fail in poorly designed categories (people don't know they need them)
- Great categories can't be won without great products (you have to deliver on the promise)
- Great products and categories fail without capable companies (execution matters)

**The Timing Element**: "At the right time" is critical. Markets have moments when category design is possible—when old paradigms are breaking and new ones can form. Being early or late with category design can be as damaging as not doing it.

**Category Design Supports Product**: Some hear the category design discussion and think it's anti-product, as if product doesn't matter. The opposite is true: category design exists BECAUSE products matter. Great products fail because they don't get category designed. Category design is in service of product success.

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit all three vertices**
   - Where are you spending 90% of your attention?
   - Is product absorbing all resources while category and company are neglected?
   - Are any vertices fundamentally broken?

2. **Design all three intentionally**
   - Product: What specific value are you creating?
   - Company: What culture, model, and capabilities do you need?
   - Category: What problem framing and market definition will you own?

3. **Recognize equal importance**
   - A 10/10 product with a 2/10 category = failure
   - A 10/10 category with a 5/10 product = losing to competitors
   - A 10/10 product and category with a 3/10 company = execution failure

4. **Get timing right**
   - Is the market ready for category design?
   - Are you early (educating too much) or late (someone else defined it)?
   - What's the window for establishing your category?

5. **Iterate on all three**
   - Product iteration is normal—so is category iteration
   - Company capabilities may need to evolve as category matures
   - Continuously refine the triangle

## When to Use It

The Magic Triangle is most valuable when:

- **Starting a company** and deciding where to allocate attention
- **Diagnosing why a good product isn't succeeding** (often category is the issue)
- **Building executive teams** (do you have leaders for all three?)
- **Raising capital** (investors should understand your category design, not just product)
- **Strategic planning** to ensure balanced investment

The Magic Triangle is less relevant when:
- You're optimizing within an established category (category vertex is fixed)
- You're a feature team within a larger product (company vertex is fixed)
- The market has already defined the category and your job is to compete within it
