# Future Visualization

> "My general thing is close my eyes and imagine the future as far out as I can. 10 years from now, whatever. Develop a really salient picture of what that looks like." - JM Nickels

## What It Is

Future Visualization is a strategy development technique where you literally visualize what the world will look like in 5-10 years, then work backwards to identify what needs to be true and what to build. It's distinct from traditional forecasting because it starts with imagination rather than extrapolation.

JM Nickels uses this approach for the future of transportation: imagining what San Francisco might look like in 10 years, what happens to parking garages, what modes of transport exist, how people live. The visualization doesn't need to be "right"—it needs to be salient enough to get you excited and identify underlying dynamics.

This technique requires dedicated, quiet time away from day-to-day operational chaos. You can't schedule 30 minutes between meetings for this; it needs space for deep thinking.

## How It Works

**Step 1: Create Space**
- Get out of the craziness of day-to-day
- Go for a run, hike, or find a quiet place
- No packed schedules, no back-to-back meetings
- Allow transition time into the right headspace

**Step 2: Visualize Far Out**
- Close your eyes and imagine 5-10+ years from now
- Make it vivid: What does the city look like? What are people doing?
- Don't worry about being "right"—focus on developing a salient picture
- Let yourself get fired up about the possibilities

**Step 3: Identify What Will Be True**
- From the visualization, extract what's likely to be true regardless of specifics
- Example: "Autonomy is a given"—this seems inevitable even if timing/players vary
- Example: "Sharing will continue to be important"—physics and congestion guarantee this
- Identify underlying dynamics vs. specific predictions

**Step 4: Apply First Principles**
- Question why things are the way they are
- "Why do we need a 4,000 pound vehicle to move a human three miles?"
- Look for inefficiencies that signal opportunity
- Ask: "Is this the best way, or just the inherited way?"

**Step 5: Work Backwards**
- From the future state, what needs to happen?
- What are tailwinds vs. headwinds?
- What can you build toward that future?

## How to Apply It

1. **Block real time** - Not 30-minute slots. Block half-days or full days for this thinking. JM's team did an all-day Monday session with 8 people, laptops down, whiteboards only.

2. **Start alone** - Do your own visualization first before bringing to teams. Have at least an outline before moving to co-creation.

3. **Go for walks/runs** - Movement helps. JM goes hiking in Marin and makes voice notes as ideas come.

4. **Use whiteboards** - "A lost art." Physical, collaborative space enables better thinking than slides.

5. **Embrace the brain trust** - Like Pixar's approach: gather people to riff without judgment. No attachment to being right. Co-explore possibilities.

6. **Don't need the perfect answer** - It's about developing a picture that gets you fired up and identifies likely dynamics.

## When to Use It

- When developing multi-year product strategy
- When a space is undergoing technological disruption (autonomy, AI)
- When you need to inspire and align teams around a direction
- When day-to-day execution has crowded out strategic thinking
- When preparing for major planning cycles
- When you feel stuck in incremental thinking
