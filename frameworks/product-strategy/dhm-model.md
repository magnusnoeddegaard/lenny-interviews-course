# DHM Model (Delight, Hard to Copy, Margin)

> "The job is to delight customers in hard to copy, margin enhancing ways." - Gibson Biddle

## What It Is

The DHM Model is a product strategy framework that provides a simple lens for evaluating any product decision or hypothesis. Developed and refined during Gibson Biddle's time at Netflix, the model argues that sustainable product strategy must satisfy three criteria simultaneously:

1. **Delight**: Does this make customers genuinely happy? Not just satisfied, but delighted—10X better than alternatives.
2. **Hard to Copy**: Will this create lasting competitive advantage? Or can competitors replicate it within a week?
3. **Margin Enhancing**: Does this build a better business? Either through increased revenue, improved retention, or reduced costs.

The framework originated from Reed Hastings at Netflix. When Hastings did a reference check on Biddle before hiring him, the only question he asked was: "Is Gib ready? Can Gib delight customers?" This emphasis on delight—not just satisfaction—became foundational to Netflix's product philosophy.

## How It Works

When evaluating any product strategy, feature, or hypothesis, score it against all three dimensions:

**Delight Assessment:**
- Will customers love this, not just tolerate it?
- Is this 10X better than what exists today?
- At Netflix, delight was measured by retention improvement

**Hard to Copy Assessment:**
- Can competitors replicate this quickly?
- Does it build network effects, unique data, or brand trust?
- Netflix's hard-to-copy advantages: personalization (taste profiles of 1B+ people), original content, brand trust

**Margin Enhancement Assessment:**
- Does this improve the business economics?
- For Netflix: Does it improve retention (reducing churn from 4.5% to 4.4% monthly)?
- Does it help right-size investments (knowing 100M will watch Stranger Things vs 20M for BoJack)?

### The Perfect New Release Test Example

Netflix customers consistently said they wanted new release DVDs faster. Netflix ran an A/B test:
- Test cell: 10,000 customers got new releases the next day
- Control: Customers got releases whenever (average 2 weeks)

Results:
- Retention improved from 4.5% to 4.45% monthly churn
- This saved ~5,000 customers × $100 LTV × 2 (word of mouth) = $1M value
- But cost was $5M additional inventory

**DHM Analysis:**
- Delight: Small (only 0.05% retention improvement)
- Hard to Copy: No (Blockbuster could add inventory too)
- Margin: Negative ($5M cost > $1M benefit)

Decision: Don't roll out. The hypothesis failed.

### The Two-Percenter Rule

A related principle: kill features used by only 2% of customers. These "two percenters" create complexity that:
- Confuses the 98% who don't use them
- Gets forgotten during major updates (Netflix forgot about profiles when launching streaming)
- Doesn't move the needle on delight or margin

## How to Apply It

1. **Frame strategies as hypotheses**: "We believe [feature] will delight customers because [reason], build hard-to-copy advantage through [mechanism], and improve margin by [metric]"

2. **Test each dimension separately**:
   - A/B test for delight (measure retention, engagement, NPS)
   - Competitive analysis for hard-to-copy (how quickly can rivals replicate?)
   - Financial modeling for margin (what's the cost vs. value created?)

3. **Accept that most hypotheses fail**: Expect 6 out of 10 product strategies to fail. The value comes from the 3-4 that work.

4. **Balance delight vs. margin carefully**: If Netflix charged $5/month instead of $20, customers would be delighted but the business wouldn't work. Use experiments to find the equilibrium.

5. **Identify your hard-to-copy advantages**: For Netflix—personalization data, original content, brand trust, network effects (every screen pre-wired for Netflix). Ask: What makes YOUR product hard to copy?

## When to Use It

- **Strategic planning**: Evaluate potential product strategies against all three dimensions
- **Feature prioritization**: Score feature ideas on D, H, and M to guide roadmap decisions
- **Go/no-go decisions**: Use as a checkpoint before major investments
- **Post-mortem analysis**: Understand why initiatives succeeded or failed
- **Competitive analysis**: Identify what makes your product defensible

## When NOT to Use It

- Very early stage when you're still searching for product-market fit (focus on delight first)
- When facing existential threats that require short-term action
- For purely operational decisions with no strategic implications
