# Competition Three Pillars

> "We recently codified our philosophy when it comes to competition... We have three pillars: hold true to our vision, grow the pie, and lean into our strengths." - Julia Schottenstein

## What It Is

The Competition Three Pillars is dbt Labs' codified approach to competitive strategy. Rather than reacting to every competitive threat, it provides a framework for maintaining focus while still being strategically aware. The framework balances conviction in your own path with collaborative ecosystem building.

## How It Works

### Pillar 1: Hold True to Your Vision

**Don't get distracted by competitive noise.**

> "Occasionally you'll have competitors maybe throw shade or throw stones, but most of that is just noise. If you have a lot of conviction that you're going in the right journey, you want to just keep your eyes straight ahead and run your best race and not be too distracted by what critics are saying."

This pillar requires:
- Deep conviction about where you're headed
- Ability to distinguish signal from noise
- Discipline to not react to every competitive move
- Focus on running your own race

### Pillar 2: Grow the Pie

**Work with ecosystem partners to expand the opportunity, not slice it up.**

> "We want to work with our partners in our ecosystem to make the opportunity set even larger... Let's focus on that as our target and work with people to make the opportunity set really attractive and not try to slice it up too thinly."

This pillar means:
- View partners as opportunity expanders, not zero-sum competitors
- Invest in ecosystem growth that benefits everyone
- Look for expanding use cases (e.g., dbt expanding from BI to ML)
- Resist the temptation to capture every adjacent market

### Pillar 3: Lean Into Your Strengths

**Know what you're good at, and leave space for ecosystem partners.**

> "We have an ambition to be a platform company and we know what we're good at, but we also want to leave space for our ecosystem to offer solutions to our users... We really feel like we can work with our ecosystem and accomplish what we want to accomplish and also help them accomplish their goals too."

This pillar involves:
- Clear understanding of your core strengths
- Strategic decisions about where to compete vs. partner
- Leaving value on the table for ecosystem health
- Winning together rather than winning everything

### The Strategic Exception

While generally collaborative, you must hold ground in core areas:

> "Generally speaking, when it comes to competition, we take a really long-term view. There are a few areas that we do want to hold our ground and that's in our transformation standard as well as our semantic standard because we believe those two are better served together for the user's sake."

Identify your "hold the line" areas—the standards or capabilities that are central to your value proposition.

## How to Apply It

### Step 1: Codify Your Vision

Write down where you're headed. This becomes your filter for competitive noise:
- What is your 5-year destination?
- What problems are you uniquely positioned to solve?
- What would success look like?

### Step 2: Map the Ecosystem

Identify:
- **Core territory**: Where you must win (hold the line)
- **Partnership opportunities**: Where ecosystem partners add value
- **Expansion zones**: Where the pie can grow for everyone

### Step 3: Establish Competitive Principles

Create team-wide guidelines:
- How do we respond to competitive FUD?
- When do we compete vs. partner?
- What competitive moves warrant reaction?

### Step 4: Take the Long View

> "Generally speaking, when it comes to competition, we take a really long-term view."

Short-term competitive wins may damage long-term ecosystem health. Evaluate competitive moves on a multi-year horizon.

## When to Use It

- **When competitors attack**: Decide if it's noise or signal
- **When evaluating new markets**: Compete or partner?
- **When partners become competitors**: How to respond
- **When building team culture**: How should your team think about competition?

## The Platform Company Angle

This framework is especially relevant for companies with platform ambitions:

> "We have an ambition to be a platform company... we want to foster an ecosystem where we can partner with lots of companies."

Platform companies benefit disproportionately from ecosystem health. A thriving ecosystem:
- Attracts more users to your platform
- Provides capabilities you don't have to build
- Creates switching costs through integrations
- Multiplies your reach through partners

## Common Anti-Patterns

1. **Reacting to every competitive jab**: Wastes energy, loses focus
2. **Trying to own every adjacent market**: Kills ecosystem, creates enemies
3. **No "hold the line" areas**: Becomes doormat, loses differentiation
4. **Pure collaboration without conviction**: Directionless, easily disrupted
