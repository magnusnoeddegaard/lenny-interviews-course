# Complexity Curve Product Thinking

> "I actually try to think about products by their complexity curve a lot. I think that the skills you need to manage a complicated ecosystem versus maybe the skills you need to design something that's less interconnected are quite different." - Hari Srinivasan

## What It Is

Complexity Curve Product Thinking is a mental model for categorizing products based on how interconnected they are with other systems, users, and stakeholders. The core insight is that different positions on this complexity curve require fundamentally different product management skills.

A children's book (low complexity) is finished once it's written—it's standalone. LinkedIn (high complexity) has interconnected marketplaces where changes in one area cascade through the entire ecosystem. A change to "Open to Work" affects job seekers, recruiters, hiring managers, employer brands, and the feed algorithm simultaneously.

## How It Works

Products exist on a spectrum from **standalone** to **deeply interconnected**:

**Low Complexity (Standalone):**
- Independent products with limited dependencies
- Changes have contained, predictable effects
- Success is more directly attributable
- Examples: Books, single-purpose apps, physical products

**High Complexity (Ecosystem):**
- Multiple interconnected components and stakeholders
- Changes create second, third, and fourth-order effects
- Success requires system-wide optimization
- Examples: Marketplaces, platforms, social networks

**Different skills for different positions:**

| Low Complexity | High Complexity |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Design intuition | Systems thinking |
| Individual craft | Cross-functional coordination |
| Direct execution | Influence without authority |
| Clear metrics | Multi-variate measurement |
| Rapid iteration | Careful ecosystem modeling |

## How to Apply It

1. **Assess your product's complexity** - How many stakeholders? How interconnected are features?
2. **Match skills to complexity** - Hire and develop skills appropriate to your position
3. **Adjust processes accordingly** - High-complexity products need more coordination mechanisms
4. **Consider second-order effects** - The more complex, the more you must think downstream
5. **Set expectations properly** - Complex products move slower but have bigger impact potential

## When to Use It

- When hiring product managers—match candidates to your complexity level
- When designing organizational processes—more complexity needs more coordination
- When planning features—assess the ripple effects before building
- When evaluating career moves—understand what skills you'll develop
- When designing metrics—complex products need more sophisticated measurement
