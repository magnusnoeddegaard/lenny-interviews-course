# Delight-Driven MVP

> "Sure, it might've got the job done, but if they weren't excited about using it the next day, then that wasn't a bar that we wanted to hit." - Cameron Adams

## What It Is

Delight-Driven MVP is a philosophy for launching minimum viable products that prioritizes user delight over mere functionality. While the Lean Startup movement popularized shipping quickly with "crappy" products to get user feedback, Canva took the opposite approach: they waited a full year before launching to ensure the product would spark joy, not just solve a problem.

The key insight is that for products relying on organic word-of-mouth growth, user excitement is not a nice-to-have—it's the primary growth engine. If users aren't enthusiastic enough to tell others, you've missed the fundamental requirement.

## How It Works

**The Standard MVP Approach:**
- Ship something quickly, even if crappy
- Get user feedback
- Iterate based on data

**The Delight-Driven Approach:**
- Research deeply to understand the problem space
- Build until the experience sparks genuine excitement
- Test extensively before launch
- Launch when users' eyes light up

**Why This Works:**
- Early startups lack marketing dollars and established channels
- The first users become your distribution engine
- Enthusiastic users spread the word; satisfied users don't
- The experience IS the product for tools where delight matters

## How to Apply It

1. **Know your problem space deeply**
   - Do extensive user research before building
   - Understand not just what users need but how they feel
   - Canva's founders spent years in adjacent products (Fusion Books) before Canva

2. **Set a delight bar, not just a functionality bar**
   - Ask: "Will this make users want to tell someone else?"
   - The words you want from user testing: "I didn't know I could do that"
   - If users say "this is useful," you're not there yet

3. **Test extensively before launch**
   - User testing isn't optional—it's how you validate delight
   - Use services like usertesting.com for rapid iteration
   - Test especially the onboarding experience

4. **Nail the onboarding**
   - First impressions determine whether delight happens
   - Lower barriers while increasing joy with each step
   - Guide users to an "I made this?!" moment quickly

5. **Know your target audience**
   - Different segments have different delight thresholds
   - Find the group that responds most enthusiastically
   - Canva identified social media managers through testing

## When to Use It

This approach is particularly suited for:

- **Consumer products** - Where word-of-mouth is the primary growth driver
- **Creative tools** - Where the experience IS the value proposition
- **Freemium models** - Where organic growth precedes monetization
- **Crowded markets** - Where differentiation through experience matters
- **Visual/emotional products** - Where "works" isn't good enough

This approach may NOT be right for:

- B2B enterprise products where procurement decisions dominate
- Products with captive distribution (pre-sold contracts)
- Products solving acute pain where any solution beats no solution
- Technical products where functionality trumps experience

## Example: Canva's One-Year MVP

Canva took a year to launch their MVP despite investor pressure:

> "Investors did ask us many, many times, 'When are you launching? Can you just get this thing out the door?' But we had done enough research, we knew the problem space."

The extra time was spent on:
- **User research** into features people wanted
- **Extensive user testing** of the experience
- **Onboarding refinement** that transformed completion rates
- **Target audience identification** (discovering social media managers)

The result: Users saying "I didn't know I could be a designer" within minutes. That reaction became their growth engine.
