# Curation-Recommendation-Generation

> "The internet started with curation, often user curation. So you took something, some good like people or books or music, and you digitize it and you put it online and then you ask users to curate it... And then after a while, the world switched from curation to recommendation, where instead of people doing that work, you had algorithms. And I think what we're entering now is we're going from curation to recommendation to generation." - Gustav Söderström

## What It Is

This framework describes the three major evolutionary phases of internet products, each representing a fundamental shift in how value is created and delivered to users. Each transition requires companies to completely rethink their user experience, business models, and core product strategies.

The key insight is that while all three phases involve technology, they require fundamentally different approaches. Don't treat generative AI as "just more of the same" machine learning—it's a paradigm shift as significant as the move from user-curated content to algorithmic recommendations.

## How It Works

**Era 1: Curation (1990s-2000s)**
- Digitize existing goods (people, books, music, products)
- Put them online in a database
- Ask users to curate and organize the content
- Examples: Early Facebook (friends curating posts), early Spotify (user playlists), early e-commerce (user reviews)

**Era 2: Recommendation (2010s)**
- Algorithms replace human curation work
- Machine learning predicts what users want
- Requires rethinking the entire user interface
- Often requires new business models (ads-based, subscription)
- Examples: Facebook newsfeed, Spotify Discover Weekly, Netflix recommendations

**Era 3: Generation (2020s+)**
- AI creates new content rather than just organizing existing content
- Products that couldn't exist before become possible
- User interfaces must be redesigned for generative experiences
- Business models may shift again
- Examples: AI DJ (personalized voice at scale), ChatGPT, Midjourney

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your current era** - Is your product primarily user-curated, algorithm-recommended, or AI-generated?

2. **Don't treat eras as incremental** - Each shift is transformational, not evolutionary. Budget accordingly for complete product rethinks.

3. **Redesign the UI for the new paradigm** - What worked for curation won't work for recommendation; what works for recommendation won't work for generation.

4. **Look for "impossible products"** - Ask: "What product couldn't exist before generative AI but now can?" Spotify's AI DJ is a personalized voice speaking to 500M users—impossible before.

5. **Plan for business model disruption** - New eras often require new ways of creating value and monetizing.

## When to Use It

- When evaluating how AI/ML will impact your product strategy
- When deciding whether to incrementally improve or fundamentally redesign
- When assessing competitive threats from next-generation products
- During strategic planning for product evolution
