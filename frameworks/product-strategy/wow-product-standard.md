# Wow Product Standard

> "We can cut down the product in terms of functionality to just most critical features, but we will never compromise on the quality and UX and the aesthetics." - Dmitry Zlokazov

## What It Is

The Wow Product Standard is Revolut's approach to product development that prioritizes making every release lovable, even when scoping down features. Rather than shipping scrappy MVPs to test ideas, they narrow functionality while maintaining exceptional quality, polish, and user experience.

The philosophy rejects the common startup practice of shipping "good enough" products to learn quickly. Instead, it argues that scrappy MVPs create an attribution problem: if a product fails to gain traction, you can't tell whether the underlying idea was wrong or the execution was just bad.

By forcing every release to delight users, Revolut removes execution quality as a variable. If a polished product fails, the idea itself was flawed. This creates cleaner feedback loops and prevents teams from wasting cycles on ideas that might have worked with better execution.

## How It Works

**Core Principles:**

1. **Narrow functionality, not quality** - Reduce scope to the most critical features, but make those features excellent
2. **Remove execution uncertainty** - If users don't love a polished product, the idea is wrong—not the implementation
3. **Pay attention to small nuances** - Details like smooth animations, frictionless processes, and aesthetic care make products lovable
4. **Founder review as quality gate** - Founders review 100% of screens before shipping to maintain the quality bar

**The Trade-off:**
- Takes longer to ship first versions
- Requires more investment per feature
- Creates slower initial learning cycles
- But produces cleaner signal on what works

**What "Wow" Means:**
- Fast and cheap transactions (table stakes in fintech)
- Smooth, frictionless user flows
- Beautiful look and feel
- Feeling that the team cared about users
- Reduced clicks and optimized funnels
- Extra effort visible in every interaction

## How to Apply It

1. **Establish a quality bar that never moves** - Define what "wow" means for your product and never ship below that bar, regardless of scope pressure

2. **Scope down features, not polish** - When timelines are tight, cut features from the roadmap—don't ship unpolished features

3. **Create founder/leader review gates** - Have senior leaders review every screen before shipping to maintain consistent quality standards

4. **Build empathy-first culture** - Hire and train people who feel customer pain and naturally want to remove friction

5. **Make polish a team habit** - Don't treat quality as a phase—embed it in how the team thinks and works daily

## When to Use It

**Strong fit:**
- Products where trust matters (fintech, healthcare, security)
- Consumer products where competition is fierce on UX
- Companies with strong founder taste and hands-on leadership
- Products where users have high expectations and low switching costs
- Categories where "wow" is a differentiator (most incumbents are mediocre)

**Consider alternatives when:**
- Validating truly novel concepts where the idea itself is the biggest risk
- B2B enterprise products where functionality trumps polish
- Extremely resource-constrained early-stage startups
- Markets where speed-to-market matters more than quality
