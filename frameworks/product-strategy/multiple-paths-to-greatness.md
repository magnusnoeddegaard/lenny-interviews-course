# Multiple Paths to Greatness

> "One of the most interesting things I've realized is there are multiple paths to greatness... if I were to look at one word to describe each of the companies I have actually worked at. Google would be technical. Facebook was very growth focused. Square was very design focused. DoorDash by nature is more operational." - Gokul Rajaram

## What It Is

Multiple Paths to Greatness is an observation about company building: there is no single formula for success. Different companies can win by being excellent at fundamentally different things - technology, growth, design, or operations - as long as their approach is authentic to the founders and appropriate for the market they're in.

This means founders shouldn't try to copy other successful companies' cultures. Instead, they should build companies that reflect their own strengths and the needs of their market.

## How It Works

### Four Paths Gokul Observed

| Company | Core Strength | Belief |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| **Google** | Technical | If you build great technology, they will come |
| **Facebook** | Growth | Set aggressive goals and work backwards (1B MAU) |
| **Square** | Design | Build the cleanest, most minimalist product |
| **DoorDash** | Operational | Product and operations intertwined at every step |

Each approach led to massive success, but they're fundamentally different philosophies.

### Why Authenticity Matters

> "Founders have to be authentic to themselves... If Jack tried to build a company that sold enterprise software, I don't think that would've worked. That's not who he is."

**The Pattern:**
- Founders build companies in their own image
- Companies succeed when the approach matches founder DNA
- Inauthentic cultures create friction and underperformance

### The Fit Requirement

Success requires alignment between:
1. **Founder strengths** - What the founder naturally excels at
2. **Company culture** - How the organization makes decisions
3. **Market needs** - What the customer segment requires

A design-led approach might fail in a market that needs operational excellence. A technical approach might not win in a market that requires growth hacking.

## How to Apply It

**For Founders:**
1. **Know your natural strengths** - Are you technical, growth-minded, design-obsessed, or operationally excellent?
2. **Build culture around your strengths** - Don't copy other companies
3. **Choose markets that match** - Where your natural approach creates advantage
4. **Hire for complementary skills** - But don't try to be something you're not

**For Employees:**
1. **Understand the company's core approach** - What do they prioritize?
2. **Evaluate cultural fit** - Does this approach match how you like to work?
3. **Recognize the tradeoffs** - Each path has things it does less well

**For Investors:**
1. **Assess founder-culture-market alignment** - Do all three match?
2. **Don't force different playbooks** - Let founders be authentic
3. **Recognize valid alternative approaches** - Success doesn't require one template

## When to Use It

- Evaluating company culture during job search
- Designing organizational culture as a founder
- Understanding why different successful companies feel so different
- Avoiding the trap of copying others' approaches
