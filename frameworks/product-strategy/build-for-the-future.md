# Build for the Future

> "You want to build for the future. It doesn't necessarily matter whether the model is good right now, but you can build product ideas such that by the time the models will be really good, it'll work really well." - Karina Nguyen

## What It Is

When building AI products, design for the model capabilities that are coming, not just what exists today. Models are improving rapidly—often faster than product development cycles. A product designed for today's capabilities may be outdated before launch, while a product designed for tomorrow's capabilities will be perfectly positioned when those capabilities arrive.

This framework acknowledges that AI capability curves are steep and predictable. What fails today may work brilliantly in six months. The most successful AI products anticipate this trajectory and design form factors that will become magical as models improve.

## How It Works

The approach involves three key insights:

1. **Capability curves are predictable** - The direction of model improvement (better reasoning, longer context, multimodal abilities) is largely known, even if timing is uncertain
2. **Form factor locks in value** - Products like Canvas or Claude Artifacts created form factors that became more valuable as models improved
3. **Ideas can wait for capabilities** - Karina notes that ideas get "locked for two years" sometimes, waiting for models to catch up

The Canvas example illustrates this perfectly: the concept of an AI-collaborative document editor was conceived before Claude 1.3 could produce high-quality edits. By the time GPT-4o arrived, the product form factor was ready to deliver magic.

## How to Apply It

For product teams building AI features:

1. **Map the capability roadmap** - Understand what model improvements are likely in 6-18 months (better coding, reasoning, multimodal, etc.)
2. **Design for "good enough + 2 generations"** - If current models are at 60% quality, design for 90%+ and accept early friction
3. **Create flexible form factors** - Build interfaces that can absorb capability improvements without redesign
4. **Prototype with future prompts** - Test your product concept by prompting more capable models (like o1) even if you'll ship with a less capable model initially
5. **Bet on capability convergence** - If multiple labs are pursuing a capability, bet that it will arrive

Questions to ask:
- "If this model were 10x better at [X], what would this product enable?"
- "What's the form factor that makes model improvement feel magical?"
- "What product ideas are we not building because today's models can't do them well?"

## When to Use It

- Planning AI product roadmaps beyond 6 months
- Deciding whether to ship an imperfect AI feature now vs. wait
- Choosing between conservative and ambitious AI product bets
- Evaluating competitive positioning in AI-native categories
- Designing platform/infrastructure that will need to scale with capabilities
