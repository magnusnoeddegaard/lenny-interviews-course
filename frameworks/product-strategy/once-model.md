# ONCE Model

> "The idea behind ONCE is... there's going to be a bit of a turn back towards the way things were. Pendulums always swing. For the last decade or so, SaaS has been pretty much the only way to run business software. Basically, you rent it. We think that there's subscription fatigue." - Jason Fried

## What It Is

The ONCE Model is an alternative to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) where customers pay once, download the software, and run it on their own infrastructure. No monthly fees, no recurring charges—just a single purchase like buying a physical product.

This isn't a return to shrink-wrapped software of the 1990s, but a modern application of that model: you get the code, you can modify it, you control your data, and you're not locked into paying forever for something that doesn't fundamentally change.

The model works particularly well for commodity software categories—products that have many alternatives, all roughly similar, yet all still charging ongoing subscription fees. In these categories, "pay once" becomes a meaningful differentiator.

## How It Works

**SaaS Model**:
- Pay monthly/annually forever
- Vendor hosts and maintains
- Data lives on vendor's servers
- Updates included automatically
- Vendor controls the software
- Pricing based on seats/usage

**ONCE Model**:
- Pay once, own forever
- Customer hosts and maintains
- Data lives on customer's servers
- Updates available (customer chooses to apply)
- Customer has full code access
- One price regardless of usage

**What Makes It Viable**:
- Customer handles hosting (reducing vendor costs)
- Zero marginal cost per customer after sale
- Enables higher one-time prices due to value proposition
- Works best for commodity categories where subscription fatigue exists
- Modern tooling makes self-hosting more accessible

## How to Apply It

1. **Target commodity categories**: Look for markets with many similar products all charging subscriptions. That's where "pay once" resonates.

2. **Build the essential 80%**: ONCE products don't need every feature. Build the core use case extremely well.

3. **Include the source code**: Customers value the ability to customize and the transparency of seeing how it works.

4. **Version your releases**: 1.x updates are free. Version 2.0 might require a paid upgrade (at a discount for existing customers).

5. **Price for one-time value**: Higher than monthly subscriptions, but the customer should recoup the cost quickly versus ongoing fees.

6. **Make installation simple**: If self-hosting is too hard, the model falls apart. Invest heavily in easy setup.

## When to Use It

- Commodity software categories with subscription fatigue
- Products where data ownership matters to customers
- Markets underserved by expensive enterprise solutions
- Security-conscious customers who need on-premises options
- Building products as an alternative to over-featured competitors
