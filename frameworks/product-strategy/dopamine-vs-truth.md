# Dopamine vs Truth Optimization

> "I'm worried that instead of building AI that will actually advance us as a species, curing cancer, solving poverty, understand the universe, all these big grand questions, we are optimizing for AI slop instead. We're basically teaching our models to chase dopamine instead of truth." - Edwin Chen

## What It Is

This framework names the fundamental tension in AI (and product) development between optimizing for what feels good to users (engagement, validation, dopamine hits) versus what is actually good for them (accuracy, genuine value, truth).

Edwin Chen argues that many AI labs, driven by benchmark competition and engagement metrics, are inadvertently steering AI toward sycophancy, entertainment, and superficial appeal rather than genuine usefulness and truth-seeking. The same dynamics that made social media toxic threaten to make AI toxic.

## How It Works

**The Engagement Trap:**
Optimizing for engagement leads to predictable pathologies:
- **Sycophancy** - "These models constantly tell you you're a genius. They'll feed into your delusions and conspiracy theories."
- **Rabbit holes** - "They'll pull you down these rabbit holes because Silicon Valley loves maximizing time spent."
- **Flashy over accurate** - "A model can hallucinate everything. But it will look impressive because it has crazy emojis, and bolding, and markdown headers."

**The Social Media Precedent:**
> "I used to work on social media. And every time we optimize for engagement, terrible things happened. You'd get clickbait and pictures of bikinis and bigfoot and horrifying skin diseases just filling your feeds. And I think I worry that the same thing's happening with AI."

**The Tabloid Effect:**
Popular benchmarks like LMM Arena optimize for casual users making snap judgments:

> "These LLM-reading users love [flashy responses]. It's literally optimizing your models for the types of people who buy tabloids at the grocery store. We've seen this in our data ourselves. The easiest way to climb LLM Arena, it's adding crazy bolding. It's doubling the number of emojis. It's tripling the length of your model responses, even if your model starts hallucinating and getting the answer completely wrong."

## How to Apply It

1. **Distinguish dopamine from value** - What makes users feel good vs. what actually helps them? These often diverge.

2. **Measure truth, not just satisfaction** - Accuracy, genuine helpfulness, and real-world task completion matter more than perceived quality.

3. **Resist engagement metrics** - Time spent, sessions per user, and similar metrics optimize for attention capture, not value delivery.

4. **Design for productivity, not stickiness** - Sometimes the best AI says "Your email is fine, just send it" rather than offering 20 more iterations.

5. **Ask: "Is this advancing the user?"** - Or is it just making them feel good while wasting their time?

## The Diagnostic Question

When evaluating any AI or product decision, ask:

> "Do you want a model that says, 'You're absolutely right. There are definitely 20 more ways to improve this email,' and it continues for 50 more iterations. And it sucks up all your time and engagement. Or do you want a model that's optimizing for your time and productivity and just says, 'No, you need to stop. Your email's great. Just send it and move on with your day'?"

## The Stakes

This isn't just about product quality—it's about what kind of AI we build for humanity:

> "I'm worried that instead of building AI that will actually advance us as a species... we are optimizing for AI slop instead."

The choices made by AI labs today shape the trajectory of the technology for decades.

## When to Use It

- When defining success metrics for AI products
- When evaluating product features that increase engagement
- When noticing AI outputs that feel good but aren't accurate
- When making strategic decisions about what to optimize for
- When designing evaluation criteria for AI systems
