# Optimize for Feelings

> "What we do at The Browser Company is we talk about optimizing feelings. How do we want to make someone feel on the other end of our software? Do we want to make them feel joy? Do we want to make them feel fast? Do we want to make them feel organized? Do we want to make them feel focused? What is the feeling we are trying to evoke in whatever we're doing?" - Josh Miller

## What It Is

Optimize for Feelings is a product development philosophy that puts human emotions at the center of design and decision-making, rather than purely quantitative metrics. While metrics serve as a tool to keep you honest about whether you're achieving your goals, the primary target of product development should be the emotional response you want to evoke in users.

This approach stands in contrast to the modern Silicon Valley tendency toward obsessing over graphs and numbers. While metrics like engagement, retention, and growth are important as feedback mechanisms, they shouldn't be the primary thing you're designing for. When you optimize purely for metrics, you can game them—but when you optimize for genuine human feelings, you create products people actually love.

## How It Works

The framework operates on several principles:

1. **Identify target emotions**: For each project, feature, or piece of content, explicitly name the feeling you want to create—joy, surprise, lightness, speed, organization, focus, etc.

2. **Use metrics as validation, not goals**: Track metrics to verify you're achieving the feelings you intended, but don't let them drive design decisions.

3. **The right feeling drives the right metric**: If you pick the right feeling (e.g., surprise and delight), it naturally leads to the business outcomes you want (e.g., users telling friends, organic growth).

4. **Think like Walt Disney, Phil Knight, Steve Jobs**: Consider how the great product creators approached their work—they weren't optimizing for graphs, they were imagining how people would feel.

## How to Apply It

1. **Start feature discussions with feelings**: Before talking about specs or requirements, ask "How do we want users to feel when they use this?" For The Browser Company's Peek feature, the answer was "light, airy, effortless."

2. **Connect feelings to business outcomes**: Map desired emotions to business results. Surprise and joy lead to word-of-mouth. Feeling smart leads to continued usage. Feeling secure leads to trust.

3. **Use the "human at the other end" test**: Constantly remember there's a person on the other end of the screen. What would make their day better?

4. **Reframe metric-focused questions**: Instead of "How do we increase shares?" ask "How do we make people feel closer to their friends?" Instead of "How do we increase retention?" ask "How do we make people feel they can't live without this?"

5. **Be conversational, not formal**: You don't need a formal "feelings spec." Have genuine conversations with your team about what emotions you're targeting.

## When to Use It

- When building consumer products where emotional connection drives adoption
- When competing in commodity markets where differentiation comes from experience
- When existing metrics aren't capturing what makes your product special
- When you notice your team is gaming metrics rather than creating genuine value
- When products feel optimized but soulless
