# Double Down on Why People Love You

> "It's about really understanding why people love you and not forgetting to invest deeply in that core concept and then building everything around that." - Jiaona Zhang

## What It Is

Double Down on Why People Love You is a strategic framework that JZ identifies as her most important learning from working at four legendary tech companies (Dropbox, Airbnb, WeWork, Webflow). The core principle: understand what makes users love your product, invest heavily in strengthening that core, and ensure everything else you build extends from—not distracts from—that foundation.

The framework addresses a common failure mode: successful companies see competitors emerge and chase them into new areas, neglecting the core that made them successful in the first place. Or they try to do too many things adequately rather than doing their core thing exceptionally.

Every company JZ worked at made versions of this mistake, and the pattern became clear: the companies that thrive are those that continuously reinvest in their core advantage rather than spreading resources thin.

## How It Works

**The Anti-Pattern:**
1. Company achieves success with a core product/experience
2. Competitor emerges in adjacent space
3. Company panics and builds competing feature
4. Resources shift away from core
5. Core experience degrades
6. Users who came for the core start to leave
7. Meanwhile, the competing feature isn't as good as the competitor's anyway

**The Correct Pattern:**
1. Understand deeply why users love you
2. Continuously invest in strengthening that core
3. When expanding, ask: "Does this leverage our core advantage?"
4. Build new things that are better *because* of the core, not despite it
5. Say no to expansions that dilute focus on the core

## Examples from JZ's Career

**Dropbox:**
- Users loved it for: Simplicity, delightfulness, easy to use
- The mistake: Saw Slack taking off, built chat features
- What they should have done: Invested in client performance (sync speed is core to the Dropbox experience) and built collaboration features around files, not around chat

**Airbnb:**
- Users loved it for: Real homes from real people, unique inventory
- The mistake: Airbnb Plus (inspecting/managing inventory), Experiences, transportation—spreading into managed marketplace territory
- What they should have done: Make the experience of understanding what's in a home better, improve host tools, strengthen the review system

**WeWork:**
- Users loved it for: Flexible, beautifully designed workspaces (operations)
- The mistake: Over-invested in tech teams building futuristic features
- What they should have done: Focus on inventory management and sales tools, not platform-level tech

**Webflow:**
- Users love it for: Powerful visual designer, design-with-data CMS
- The lesson being applied: Continue investing deeply in the designer experience rather than spreading thin across too many product areas

## How to Apply It

1. **Articulate why people love you** - Don't assume you know. Talk to users. What brings them? What makes them stay? What do they tell friends?

2. **Audit your investment** - What percentage of your resources go toward strengthening the core vs. building adjacent things?

3. **Question competitive responses** - When tempted to build something because of a competitor, ask: "Is this actually our alpha, or are we playing their game?"

4. **Apply the leverage test** - For new initiatives, ask: "Will this be better because it builds on our core, or is it unrelated to what makes us special?"

5. **Protect core investment** - Even when pressured to expand, maintain dedicated investment in the foundational experience

6. **Build extensions, not tangents** - Expansion should flow from the core. Dropbox → collaboration around files. Airbnb → trust signals and unique stays.

## The Strategic Questions

Before any major investment, ask:

1. **What do people love about us?** - Name it specifically
2. **How does this strengthen or extend that?** - Be honest
3. **Would this be better because of our core, or despite it?** - If despite, reconsider
4. **What would we not invest in to fund this?** - Is that trade-off worth it?
5. **Are we chasing a competitor or serving our users?** - Know the difference

## When to Use It

- **Annual/quarterly planning** - Evaluate roadmap against core advantage
- **Competitive response decisions** - Avoid reflexive "me too" features
- **M&A and partnerships** - Ensure acquisitions strengthen the core
- **New product initiatives** - Build from your center of gravity
- **Resource allocation debates** - Defend investment in fundamentals
