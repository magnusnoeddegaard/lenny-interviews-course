# Build the Scooter, Not the Axle

> "Build the scooter, not the axle. So if you're trying to build the minimum viable product for a car, don't build just the wheels and the axle, build the scooter first. And then from there, you build the bicycle, and the motorcycle, and then the car. It's always such a good reminder. You always want to start building the whole thing. But really try and think about the slice that gets the customer to complete value on a smaller thing first." - Eeke de Milliano

## What It Is

This framework provides guidance for scoping MVPs and early product development. The insight is that teams often build components of their vision (the axle) instead of building a complete, smaller version of it (the scooter). The axle is useless alone; the scooter provides real transportation value immediately.

The progression is: scooter → bicycle → motorcycle → car. Each stage is a complete, usable product that provides value, not just a building block toward the ultimate vision.

## How It Works

**The Anti-Pattern (Building the Axle):**
- Build the backend infrastructure first
- Create platform capabilities before any use case
- Focus on scalability before proving value
- Deliver components that don't work alone

**The Better Approach (Building the Scooter):**
- Identify the smallest complete product that delivers value
- Build end-to-end for a specific, narrow use case
- Ensure customers can achieve "complete value" immediately
- Expand scope only after proving the narrow case works

**Example - Retool Mobile:**
Instead of building a general mobile app platform, Retool scoped to:
- "Companies with field workers who need inventory management"
- This narrow slice enabled end-to-end completion
- Broader use cases came after proving the specific slice

## How to Apply It

1. **Define your "car"** - What's the full vision you're building toward?

2. **Identify your "scooter"** - What's the smallest complete product that delivers value to a specific user type?

3. **Ensure complete value** - Can users accomplish their goal end-to-end, even if the scope is narrow?

4. **Plan your progression** - What's the bicycle? The motorcycle? Map the path from scooter to car.

5. **Resist the urge to build platform first** - Every platform capability should be driven by a specific scooter-level use case

## When to Use It

- When starting a new product or major feature
- When scoping an MVP
- When you feel tempted to "build the foundation first"
- When teams are building infrastructure without clear use cases
- During product reviews where scope feels too broad

## Scooter → Car Progression Examples

| Vision (Car) | Scooter | Bicycle | Motorcycle |
|--------------|---------|---------|------------|
| Full mobile app builder | Inventory management for field workers | Data collection forms | Full workflow automation |
| Complete CRM | Contact management for sales reps | Deal pipeline tracking | Forecasting and analytics |
| Enterprise chat platform | Team messaging for engineering | Threaded conversations | Integrations and bots |
