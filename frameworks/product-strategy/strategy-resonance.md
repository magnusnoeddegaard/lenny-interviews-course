# Strategy Resonance

> "There is this concept called resonance... when you apply a certain frequency to an object and you get pretty close to its natural frequency, you see a disproportionate increase in the amplitude of how that object vibrates. If you apply any other frequency, there's very little effect on the object, but if you get close to its natural frequency, there's this exponential increase in the vibration... Strategy is selecting that frequency to achieve resonance between the product and the market." - Chandra Janakiraman

## What It Is

Strategy Resonance is a mental model borrowed from physics that explains why strategy matters and what it means to get it right. In physics, resonance occurs when you apply a frequency to an object that matches its natural frequency—the result is a disproportionately large response compared to applying any other frequency.

Applied to business, your strategy is selecting the specific "frequency" (areas of investment, positioning, capabilities) that will create resonance between your product and the market. When you find that frequency, you see tremendous, almost exponential impact. When you're off the mark, even with significant effort, the effect is minimal.

This explains why some products seem to effortlessly gain traction while others struggle despite similar or even greater investment. It's not just about effort—it's about finding the right frequency.

## How It Works

The resonance metaphor illuminates several strategic truths:

**1. Small adjustments can have massive effects**
Just like tuning a radio dial, small changes in strategic focus can shift you from static to crystal clear signal. Getting "close enough" to the market's natural frequency produces disproportionate results.

**2. Wrong frequencies waste energy**
Applying effort in the wrong strategic areas is like transmitting on the wrong frequency—no matter how much power you put in, you won't get resonance. This is why "trying harder" isn't always the answer.

**3. Each market has its own frequency**
Different markets, customer segments, and timing windows have different natural frequencies. A strategy that created resonance in one context may produce nothing in another. This is why you can't just copy successful strategies without deep understanding.

**4. Resonance amplifies, not adds**
When strategy is right, results compound exponentially rather than adding linearly. This explains why strategic companies can dramatically outperform competitors with similar resources.

## How to Apply It

1. **Diagnose non-resonance**: If you're investing heavily but not seeing outsized results, you may be on the wrong frequency—step back and reconsider strategic choices rather than doubling down

2. **Test multiple frequencies**: During strategy formulation, explore different strategic pillars as different frequencies. The one that shows early signs of resonance (unexpectedly strong customer response, organic growth, efficiency gains) may be closer to the market's natural frequency

3. **Tune continuously**: Markets shift, competition changes, customer needs evolve—the natural frequency changes too. Regular strategy reviews help you stay tuned

4. **Look for resonance signals**: Unexpected success, word-of-mouth growth, customer pull rather than push, efficient customer acquisition—these suggest you've found resonance

5. **Be willing to abandon non-resonant strategies**: Sunk cost fallacy is especially dangerous with strategy. If you're not getting resonance despite significant effort, the frequency may simply be wrong

## When to Use It

- When evaluating why a product or feature isn't gaining traction despite investment
- When deciding between strategic options—look for which one might achieve resonance
- When explaining to stakeholders why "more effort" isn't always the answer
- When assessing whether to persist with or pivot from a strategic direction
- When analyzing why a competitor is outperforming you with seemingly similar resources
