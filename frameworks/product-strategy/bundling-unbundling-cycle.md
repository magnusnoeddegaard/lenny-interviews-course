# Bundling-Unbundling Cycle

> "Empires long united must divide, long divided must unite... There's too much of a zig and the zag." - Ivan Zhao (quoting Romance of the Three Kingdoms)

## What It Is

The Bundling-Unbundling Cycle is the observation that markets repeatedly oscillate between consolidation (bundling) and fragmentation (unbundling). Understanding where you are in this cycle helps you decide whether to build a horizontal platform or a vertical point solution.

Ivan Zhao draws from both business history and ancient Chinese literature to illustrate this pattern. The opening line of Romance of the Three Kingdoms—"Empires long united must divide, long divided must unite"—captures the same dynamic that drives software markets.

**The software cycle:**
- **Pre-PC era**: Work happened on paper, a fully democratized medium
- **1980s (unbundling)**: The first software era fragmented work into many specialized applications
- **1990s (bundling)**: Microsoft Office bundled everything back into one suite
- **2000s-2010s (unbundling)**: SaaS fragmented work again—average companies now use ~100 tools
- **2020s (bundling)**: Market shifting back toward consolidation, accelerated by AI

We're currently at the tail end of SaaS unbundling, with macro pressures and AI capabilities pushing toward bundling. For horizontal product builders like Notion, this creates a tailwind. For vertical SaaS builders, it's a warning signal.

## How It Works

The cycle operates through predictable forces:

**Unbundling Forces:**
- New technology platforms enable new specialized solutions
- Point solutions can optimize harder for specific use cases
- Lower barrier to entry creates fragmentation
- Users initially value best-of-breed for specific needs

**Bundling Forces:**
- Fragmentation creates integration pain and context-switching costs
- Consolidated data enables better AI and automation
- Economic pressure drives cost consolidation
- Users eventually value unified experiences over marginal feature differences

The cycle isn't perfectly predictable, but recognizing the phase helps with strategic positioning. Building a vertical solution during a bundling phase means swimming upstream. Building a horizontal platform during an unbundling phase means competing against optimized point solutions.

## How to Apply It

1. **Diagnose the current phase** - Look at your market. Are average companies using more tools or fewer? Is there integration fatigue or appetite for specialized solutions? Are budgets consolidating or expanding?

2. **Match your strategy to the phase** - In bundling phases, horizontal platforms and "all-in-one" solutions have tailwinds. In unbundling phases, vertical solutions that optimize deeply for specific needs win.

3. **Watch for transition signals** - The average company using 100 SaaS tools signals unbundling exhaustion. AI making bundled data more valuable signals bundling acceleration. New platforms emerging signals unbundling opportunity.

4. **Position for the next phase** - If you're already in market, prepare for the cycle to turn. Vertical players should think about platform plays. Horizontal players should think about how to win specific verticals.

5. **Use the long view** - The cycle takes years, not months. Don't pivot based on short-term signals, but do build with cycle awareness.

## When to Use It

- When deciding whether to build horizontal or vertical
- When evaluating competitive threats from different strategic positions
- When investors or advisors push you toward specialization (or consolidation)
- When understanding why certain markets feel more competitive than others
- When timing market entry or expansion strategies
