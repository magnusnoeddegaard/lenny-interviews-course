# Product-Market Fit Erosion

> "User expectations just continue to go up every day in terms of their expectations on user experience, on the value that they expect your product to provide, but also the competitive landscape in the market continues to get better... if you're not continually pushing to make your product better, your user experience better, your latency better, then you're eventually not necessarily tomorrow, but maybe in a year, maybe in five years, you might find yourself fall out of product market fit entirely." - Casey Winters

## What It Is

A framework for understanding that product-market fit is not a permanent achievement but an ongoing state that erodes over time. Two forces constantly work against you:

1. **Rising user expectations** - Users expect better UX, faster performance, and more value every day
2. **Improving competition** - The competitive landscape gets better continuously

Standing still means falling behind. If you're not actively maintaining and improving PMF, you're losing it.

## How It Works

### The Erosion Dynamics

```
PMF at Time 1:  ████████████████████  (Strong fit)
User expectations rise... competition improves...
PMF at Time 2:  █████████████████     (Slight erosion)
Without improvement...
PMF at Time 3:  █████████████         (Significant erosion)
Eventually...
PMF at Time 4:  █████████             (Lost PMF)
```

### Why This Happens

**User Expectations Rise Because:**
- They experience better products elsewhere
- Technology enables faster, smoother experiences
- Their needs and sophistication increase
- Memory of how things used to be fades

**Competition Improves Because:**
- New entrants learn from your playbook
- Technology becomes more accessible
- Best practices spread across industries
- Venture funding accelerates competitive development

### The Danger of Catching Up Late

If you lose PMF through erosion:
- It takes a long time to even recognize you've lost it
- By the time you know, you're far behind
- Technical debt has accumulated
- Rebuilding takes longer than maintaining would have

## How to Apply It

### Shift Your Mental Model

**Early Stage Mindset (wrong at scale):**
"Everything we do drives upside—growth, new features, new markets"

**At-Scale Mindset (required):**
"We could lose what we've built. Protection is as important as growth."

### Track Leading Indicators

- Performance metrics (latency, reliability)
- User satisfaction trends
- Feature parity vs. competitors
- Design quality vs. market expectations
- Technical debt levels

### Budget for Maintenance

Allocate resources to:
- Performance improvements
- User experience refinements
- Technical debt reduction
- Competitive parity features

### Create Protection Metrics

Casey suggests: "Trying to help executives understand that this thing we've got, whether it's a high conversion rate or good engagement on this feature, it could go away if we don't do these other things."

Frame maintenance work as protecting existing gains, not just preventing hypothetical loss.

## When to Use It

- **Roadmap prioritization**: When maintenance competes with new features
- **Resource allocation**: Justifying investment in "non-sexy" improvements
- **Executive communication**: Making the case for performance, UX, and tech debt work
- **Competitive strategy**: Understanding you're in a race that doesn't pause
