# Design is Art Applied to Problem Solving

> "I like art applied to problem solving because I think that design is often... There is some component of creativity to it and unique expression that you're trying to provide and create and put out into the world. But you are also trying to do it and match it to a user need, a problem that needs to be solved. And I think that it's not pure art, but if you lose the art and you're just solving the problem, it's totally utilitarian and it lacks soul. And so the combination of those two things is to me really beautiful." - Dylan Field

## What It Is

A definition of design that captures its dual nature: design must be both creative/expressive AND functional/problem-solving. It sits at the intersection of art and utility.

This framework helps resolve the false dichotomy between "beautiful" and "useful"—great design is both, and losing either component diminishes the work.

## How It Works

**The Two Components:**

1. **Art (Creativity + Expression)**
   - Unique visual and interactive expression
   - Creative solutions that surprise and delight
   - Soul, personality, distinctiveness
   - Something only you could have made

2. **Problem Solving (Utility + Function)**
   - Addressing a real user need
   - Making something that works
   - Solving for the struggling moment
   - Practical, usable, effective

**The Balance:**

| Approach | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| Art only | Beautiful but useless—doesn't solve the problem |
| Problem solving only | Functional but soulless—"totally utilitarian and lacks soul" |
| Art + Problem Solving | Design that is both useful AND meaningful |

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with the problem** - Design begins with understanding what user need you're addressing. Without this anchor, art becomes self-indulgent.

2. **Don't settle for utilitarian** - Once you've solved the problem, ask: "Does this have soul? Does this express something unique? Would a user feel something beyond mere satisfaction?"

3. **Evaluate both dimensions** - When reviewing design work, check both boxes:
   - Does it solve the problem effectively?
   - Does it bring creativity and unique expression?

4. **Use craft to differentiate** - In a world of AI-generated designs, the human creativity and expression component becomes the moat. Dylan argues that as AI makes "the most obvious thing in the most obvious form possible," craft and unique design become MORE important.

## Implications for the AI Era

Dylan makes this point explicitly in the context of AI tools like "make design" features:

- AI can handle the problem-solving component effectively
- AI produces "the most obvious thing in the most obvious form"
- The art component—unique expression, craft, soul—becomes the differentiator
- Design as a differentiator increases in importance, not decreases

## When to Use It

- Evaluating design work (check both dimensions)
- Explaining why "functional" isn't good enough
- Arguing for design investment and craft
- Understanding why AI won't replace designers
- Teaching designers to balance utility and expression
