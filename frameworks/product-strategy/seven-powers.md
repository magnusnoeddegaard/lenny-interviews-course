# 7 Powers Framework

> "Power requires a benefit and a barrier. You have to have something that you do that gives you a better outcome than your competitors, lower cost or higher price, and then something that makes it impossible for somebody else to mimic that." - Hamilton Helmer

## What It Is

The 7 Powers framework identifies the only seven sources of sustainable competitive advantage in business. Developed by Hamilton Helmer over decades of strategy work, it provides an exhaustive taxonomy of what creates durable business value. The framework is used by leaders at Netflix, Spotify, and many other iconic companies.

Unlike generic "moat" thinking, 7 Powers is precise about both the benefit (what advantage you have) and the barrier (why competitors can't copy it). Many things that feel like advantages—great teams, fast execution, brand recognition—fail the power test because they can be mimicked.

The seven powers are:
1. **Scale Economies** - Cost advantages from being larger
2. **Network Economies** - Value increases as more users join
3. **Counter Positioning** - A business model incumbents can't adopt
4. **Switching Costs** - Value loss from switching to competitors
5. **Branding** - Higher willingness to pay based on reputation
6. **Cornered Resource** - Exclusive access to a valuable asset
7. **Process Power** - Embedded processes that can't be replicated

## How It Works

Each power type has specific characteristics:

**Scale Economies**: Fixed costs spread over more units (e.g., Netflix's content costs spread over more subscribers). The barrier is the cost of catching up.

**Network Economies**: Product value increases with users. The barrier is winner-take-all dynamics. Note: Many "network effects" don't create material network economies.

**Counter Positioning**: Your business model would damage an incumbent's existing business if they adopted it. The barrier is the incumbent's rational unwillingness to cannibalize themselves.

**Switching Costs**: Customers lose value when leaving (data, integrations, learning). The barrier is the customer's own investment.

**Branding**: Customers pay premium prices based on reputation and trust. The barrier is the time required to build comparable reputation.

**Cornered Resource**: Exclusive access to patents, talent, or assets. The barrier is legal rights or information asymmetry.

**Process Power**: Organizational capabilities so complex and embedded they can't be replicated. The barrier is opacity and complexity. This is rare—most operational excellence can be copied.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your claimed source of power** - What do you believe makes you defensible?

2. **Apply the benefit test** - Does this give you materially better unit economics (lower cost or higher prices)?

3. **Apply the barrier test** - Can competitors realistically replicate this within a reasonable timeframe?

4. **Be honest about materiality** - A small advantage that can be overcome isn't power. "We laugh whenever we hear somebody say they have a flywheel... the ones that really are material are rare."

5. **Match power to stage** - Only some powers are available at different business stages:
   - Early stage: Counter positioning is often your only option
   - Growth stage: Scale economies, switching costs, network economies
   - Mature stage: Branding, process power

## When to Use It

- Evaluating whether your startup has defensibility
- Investment decisions (does this company have power?)
- Strategic planning to identify what power you're building toward
- Competitive analysis to understand incumbent vulnerabilities
- Stress-testing pitch deck "moat" claims

## Common Pitfalls

**Mistaking recognition for branding power**: "People sometimes think they have branding power" but brand recognition alone isn't power—you paid for it with marketing spend.

**Overestimating data scale economies**: "People often think that they get scale economies through data... but the range of scale that existing competitors have are often large enough to put them in shouting distance."

**Confusing network effects with network economies**: Having network effects doesn't mean having power. Uber and Lyft "probably have network effects involved but not network economies" because the advantage isn't material enough.

**Assuming operational excellence is power**: "The things that drive operational excellence can be mimicked. You can hire a consulting firm who has best practices... you can hire people from your competitors."
