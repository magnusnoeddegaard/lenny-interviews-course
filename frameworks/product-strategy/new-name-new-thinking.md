# New Name, New Thinking

> "Whether or not you like the idea of the storytelling team or something else, a byproduct of some of these experiments that we've found works really well is when you give something a new name, it sheds a lot of preconceived notions of what the thing should be." - Josh Miller

## What It Is

New Name, New Thinking is a practical technique for escaping mental constraints: when you give a product feature, team, or concept a novel name (instead of an industry-standard one), you force yourself and your team to think from first principles about what it should be.

Standard names carry baggage. When you say "browser history," everyone immediately pictures what browser history is and how it works. When you call a team "marketing," everyone brings assumptions about what marketing teams do. By using unfamiliar names, you create space for genuine discovery.

This isn't novelty for its own sake—it's a rhetorical tactic to get people to think intentionally about what something should actually be, rather than defaulting to what it has traditionally been.

## How It Works

The technique operates through cognitive mechanisms:

1. **Familiar names trigger scripts**: "Marketing team" activates all your mental models about marketing teams
2. **Novel names require explanation**: "Storytelling team" prompts "what does that mean?"—forcing genuine discussion
3. **Discussion surfaces assumptions**: When you have to explain what something is, you examine what it should be
4. **First principles emerge**: Without the script, you ask "what are we actually trying to do here?"

Examples from The Browser Company:
- "Storytelling team" instead of "marketing/PR/communications"
- "Membership team" instead of "support/success/research"
- No "PMs" as a title—the verbs exist but not the category
- "Members" instead of "users/customers"

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify a convention**: What are you about to name using industry-standard terminology?

2. **Pause before naming**: Before calling it "browser history" or "onboarding flow," stop.

3. **Ask what you're actually trying to do**: "We want people to find things they've seen before" vs "we're building browser history"

4. **Create a new name**: It can be temporary or permanent. The point is to trigger discussion.

5. **Use the new name consistently**: If you slip back to the old name, the mental scripts return

6. **Be okay with eventual convergence**: The new name might eventually become "marketing" again. That's fine—you'll have thought it through first.

## When to Use It

- When building something that could easily become a clone of existing solutions
- When you notice yourself assuming you know what something should be
- When a team is stuck in conventional thinking
- When joining a new company/team and wanting fresh perspective
- When industry conventions are actively limiting innovation

## Limitations

There's a tradeoff: unfamiliar names can confuse people (especially in hiring, press, partnerships). Josh notes this:

- When Airbnb called PMs "producers," they got film producer applicants
- At some point, you may need standard names for practical reasons

The technique is about enabling first-principles thinking, not permanent rebellion against convention.
