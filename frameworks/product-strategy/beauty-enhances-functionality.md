# Beauty Enhances Functionality

> "As if people think about functionality and beauty as like two opposite things. No, they're not two opposite things. Functionality is important. And actually beauty enhances functionality because it does make things easier to use, more approachable, more compelling to use." - Katie Dill

## What It Is

There's a persistent belief in business that beauty is frivolous—that functionality is what matters and beauty is optional decoration. Katie Dill argues this is fundamentally wrong. Beauty and functionality aren't opposites; they're complementary. Beautiful products are more functional, not less.

The word "beauty" in books digitized by Google has decreased dramatically since the 1800s, correlating with an industrial focus on pure functionality. But research shows people respond more positively in beautiful environments (Penn Station vs Grand Central), and products that demonstrate care through beauty build trust.

For B2B products like Stripe, beauty matters enormously even though some assume it shouldn't for "business software." Beautiful products signal that the company cares about details—including details users can't see.

## How It Works

**Beauty builds trust:**
When users see painstaking attention to visual detail, they trust that the company cares about other details too—including security, reliability, and accuracy. This is especially important for financial infrastructure.

**Beauty increases usability:**
Well-designed products with clear visual hierarchy, appropriate spacing, and thoughtful layout are genuinely easier to use. Beauty isn't separate from usability—it's a component of it.

**Beauty creates better user outcomes:**
People who feel good while using a product make better decisions, are more patient, and are more likely to complete tasks successfully.

**Beauty begets beauty:**
When users see creativity and care in your product, it inspires them. They want to create beautiful things too. This matters for tools that enable creation.

**Beauty attracts talent:**
People who care about craft want to work with others who care about craft. Beautiful products signal a culture of excellence.

## How to Apply It

1. **Stop framing beauty as optional** - Include design quality in product requirements, not as nice-to-have polish.

2. **Connect beauty to outcomes** - Track how visual improvements affect trust metrics, completion rates, and user satisfaction.

3. **Reference the Penn Station research** - Tweets from Penn Station are more negative than from Grand Central. Environment affects mindset.

4. **Lead with functionality AND beauty** - Great products need both utility AND usability AND desirability. It's not a trade-off.

5. **Use beauty to signal care** - Especially for products where trust matters, beautiful execution demonstrates attention to detail.

## When to Use It

- When someone argues that beauty doesn't matter for B2B products
- When advocating for design resources or time
- When defining quality standards for products
- When explaining why Stripe invests so heavily in design
- When building products where trust and credibility matter
