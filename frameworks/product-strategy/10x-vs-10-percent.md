# 10X vs 10% Thinking

> "If you have a choice between trying something that could have a massive breakthrough, a massive change, and playing small ball where you're going to get a bunch of 10% improvements, you are over time, if you're willing to try, if you're willing to fail, if you're willing to push yourself, if you're willing to think bigger... you'll achieve massive, massive breakthrough." - Ken Norton

## What It Is

10X vs 10% Thinking is a mindset framework that encourages leaders to pursue breakthrough innovation by aiming for 10X improvements rather than settling for incremental 10% optimizations.

The core insight: we think too small. Real breakthrough innovations—like the coronavirus vaccine—require big, bold swings where failure is probable but success would be transformative. Playing it safe with 10% improvements feels rational but caps your potential.

This concept was central to Google's innovation culture, where Ken Norton worked for 14 years, and it explains how companies achieve truly breakthrough products.

## How It Works

**10% thinking:**
- Optimizing existing products and processes
- Low risk, predictable outcomes
- Guaranteed small gains
- Often leads to playing it safe
- Limits potential upside

**10X thinking:**
- Pursuing massive breakthrough innovations
- High risk, uncertain outcomes
- Most attempts will fail
- Creates an environment for creativity
- Enables transformative success

**Why 10X works at scale:**
If you're willing to try many 10X bets knowing most will fail, the ones that succeed will generate so much value that they more than compensate for all the failures. This is why venture capitalists and research labs embrace this model.

**The Kodak lesson:**
Kodak invented the digital camera but failed to pursue it because the environment didn't encourage big bets that might cannibalize existing business. The ideas were there—the culture wasn't.

## How to Apply It

1. **At the company level** - Google used a 70-20-10 allocation: 70% on core business, 20% on adjacent opportunities, 10% on crazy bets that might not work.

2. **At the team level** - Even within a team, create space for innovation. Maybe one engineer every sprint works on a moonshot, or you dedicate time a few times per year for experimental work.

3. **Create psychological safety** - Big ideas need to be brought forward without fear. Leaders must create environments where people can propose ambitious ideas that might fail.

4. **Embrace intelligent failure** - Not every bet will work. That's expected. The portfolio approach means you succeed if a small percentage of 10X bets pay off.

5. **Challenge small thinking** - When teams bring conservative proposals ("Let's improve conversion by 3%"), push them: "What would 10X look like? What would we have to believe?"

## When to Use It

Use 10X thinking when:

- Your industry is being disrupted and incremental won't save you
- You have the resources to make multiple bets
- You want to create breakthrough products, not just maintain existing ones
- You're building a culture of innovation
- You're evaluating where to invest R&D resources

Use 10% thinking when:

- Optimizing a proven product for efficiency
- Operating in highly regulated environments
- Your core business needs stability
- You're resource-constrained and can't afford failures

Most organizations need both—the question is getting the balance right.
