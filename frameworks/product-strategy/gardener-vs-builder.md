# Gardener vs Builder Mindset

> "So much of the way that we tackle problems and build products is this builder mindset. It's like I have a plan. I then manipulate things to match my plan and make it happen. Part of the problem though is it can't possibly create more value than the effort that you put into it. What I look for instead are things that can be gardened, things that can grow on their own." - Alex Komoroske

## What It Is

The Gardener vs Builder Mindset is a fundamental shift in how product leaders approach creating value. The builder mindset focuses on planning, control, and execution—you design something, then manipulate resources to make it happen. The gardener mindset focuses on emergence, cultivation, and direction—you plant seeds, nurture what grows, and curate over time.

The key insight is that builder activities can never create more value than the effort you put in. Gardener activities, when done properly, can create compounding value that far exceeds the initial investment. If you find things that can grow on their own, you unlock exponential rather than linear returns.

## How It Works

**Builder Mindset:**
- Create a plan
- Manipulate resources to match the plan
- Execute against milestones
- Value created ≤ effort invested
- Success looks like hitting targets

**Gardener Mindset:**
- Plant many small seeds (low-cost experiments)
- Nurture what shows signs of life
- Direct growth without forcing outcomes
- Value created >> effort invested (when it works)
- Success looks like "magic" or "luck"

**The Magic of Seeds:**
When you plant a seed:
- If it doesn't grow, the cost was minimal (just the effort of planting)
- If it grows, you get something far more valuable than your investment
- You don't have to know ahead of time which seeds will grow
- Protect seedlings from being dug up too early (squirrels = internal politics)

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify things with compounding potential**
   - Look for network effects, ecosystems, viral loops
   - Ask: "If this works, will it work at an accelerating rate?"
   - Compounding dynamics are everywhere—learn to spot them

2. **Make planting cheap**
   - Reduce the cost of experiments to near-zero
   - Let team members pursue ideas they're excited about
   - Frame failures as "that seed didn't grow" not "that project failed"

3. **Respond to signals, don't force outcomes**
   - Invest incrementally in things showing signs of life
   - Stop watering things that aren't growing
   - Let the environment tell you what's working

4. **Create cover fire**
   - Spend 70% of effort on clearly valuable work that justifies your team's existence
   - Use the remaining 30% to plant seeds
   - "If someone says 'what does that team do anyway?' your team is on the verge of death"

5. **Protect seedlings**
   - Shield early-stage ideas from premature scrutiny
   - Build trust and credibility to buy space for experimentation
   - Accept that you can't prove in advance which seeds will work

## When to Use It

**Gardener mindset is powerful when:**
- You're building ecosystems or platforms
- There are network effects or compounding dynamics
- The outcome space is highly uncertain
- You need breakthrough innovation, not incremental improvement
- You want to create 10x more value than you invest

**Builder mindset is still appropriate when:**
- The problem is well-defined
- The solution is known
- Execution speed is critical
- Risks need to be minimized
- You're optimizing, not exploring

**Warning signs you're over-indexing on builder:**
- Your output is always proportional to your input
- Success requires heroic effort every time
- You can't delegate or scale without losing quality
- Everything feels like pushing a boulder uphill
