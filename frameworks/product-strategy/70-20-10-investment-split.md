# 70/20/10 Investment Split

> "70% of your building time should really be going to your core product, that has product market fit. 20% of your time should be going to strategic initiatives that aren't core, but they're strategic to the company, that you know you have to do them. And then, 10% of your time should be going towards bets." - Eeke de Milliano

## What It Is

The 70/20/10 Investment Split is a simple heuristic for allocating product and engineering resources across three buckets: core business, strategic initiatives, and exploratory bets. Unlike more complex portfolio frameworks, this provides an easy-to-remember guideline that can be applied at team or company level.

The insight is that a lot of product management "can be reduced to funnels and portfolios." This framework gives you a starting point for the portfolio question.

## How It Works

**70% - Core Product:**
- Your existing product with product-market fit
- Includes tech debt and maintenance
- Includes incremental improvements
- Anything keeping your current business running and growing

**20% - Strategic Initiatives:**
- Not core, but clearly strategic
- You know you have to do them based on your strategy
- May include platform work, compliance requirements, or expansion
- Important but not urgent work that serves the long-term vision

**10% - Bets:**
- Exploratory work with uncertain outcomes
- High risk, potentially high reward
- May become tomorrow's core product or strategic initiatives
- Innovation and experimentation

## How to Apply It

1. **Categorize current work** - Map existing projects into the three buckets

2. **Compare to target** - How does your current allocation compare to 70/20/10?

3. **Adjust incrementally** - Don't make dramatic shifts; adjust planning cycle by cycle

4. **Protect the 10%** - Bets are most likely to get squeezed; defend this allocation

5. **Include bugs in core** - Tech debt, maintenance, and bugs are part of the 70%, not separate

## When to Adjust the Ratio

The 70/20/10 split is a heuristic, not a rule. Adjust based on:

| Situation | Adjustment |
|-----------|------------|
| Pre-PMF | 90/5/5 - Focus almost entirely on finding PMF |
| Mature product with strong PMF | 60/25/15 - More room for strategic and bets |
| Technical debt crisis | 80/15/5 - Pay down debt before investing in new |
| Competitive threat | 75/20/5 - Protect core, reduce experimentation |
| New platform opportunity | 65/20/15 - More bets to explore opportunity |
