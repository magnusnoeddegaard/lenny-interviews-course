# Unifying Concept

> "There kind of needs to be a unifying concept across all of your services within the app for your users to be able to think about your product in a sensible way." - Kevin Aluwi

## What It Is

The Unifying Concept framework explains why super apps often fail to achieve the promised benefits of lower customer acquisition costs and higher cross-sell rates. The key insight: customers need a coherent mental model that connects all your services. Without it, each new service requires its own marketing investment and customer education.

At Gojek, customers thought about "the driver." When they expanded from ride-hailing to package delivery to food delivery, the expansion made intuitive sense because the same driver could do all these things. But when they added mobile top-ups or massage services, the connection broke down. Only 30-40% of customers even knew Gojek offered mobile top-ups—despite it being prominently displayed on the homepage—because it didn't fit their mental model of what Gojek was.

This framework challenges the common assumption that adding services to a high-engagement app automatically transfers loyalty and reduces acquisition costs.

## How It Works

**The Mental Model Test:**
Customers don't think in terms of your app architecture. They think in terms of a central concept:
- **Gojek**: "The driver" - a person on a motorcycle who can take me places, deliver things, or bring me food
- **Amazon**: "The store" - a place to buy things
- **WeChat**: "Messaging + payments" - how I communicate and transact with people

**When Expansion Works:**
Services that connect to the unifying concept get natural cross-sell:
- Ride-hailing → Package delivery → Food delivery (all driver-related)
- Each new service feels like an obvious extension
- Customers discover and adopt without heavy marketing

**When Expansion Fails:**
Services that break from the concept require re-education:
- Gojek adding massage services led to confused customers asking: "Is the driver going to give me a massage?"
- Mobile top-ups, despite 95%+ relevance, had only 30-40% awareness
- Each service feels like a separate app that happens to share a login

**The Super App Trap:**
The standard super app pitch sounds great:
- Lower customer acquisition costs
- Higher attach rates across services
- Better retention through multiple touchpoints
- Easy cross-selling and upselling

But these benefits only materialize when services share a unifying concept. Otherwise, you're just running multiple businesses that happen to share infrastructure.

## How to Apply It

1. **Define your unifying concept clearly**
   - What central idea do customers associate with your product?
   - Test this by asking users: "What is [product] for?"
   - The answer should naturally encompass your expansion plans

2. **Evaluate new services against the concept**
   - Does this service logically connect to what customers already think we do?
   - Would customers be surprised or confused by this addition?
   - Can you explain the connection in one sentence?

3. **Measure concept coherence**
   - Run UX research on awareness of existing features
   - Low awareness despite prominent placement = concept mismatch
   - Ask customers: "Did you know you could [X] in our app?"

4. **Design for conceptual consistency**
   - If expanding beyond your concept, acknowledge the marketing investment required
   - Don't assume existing engagement will transfer
   - Consider whether a separate app might actually perform better

5. **Accept the design constraints**
   - Super apps with many unrelated services often become giant grids
   - This limits design innovation and can feel overwhelming
   - Conceptual coherence enables cleaner, more intuitive design

## When to Use It

- Planning product expansions or new service additions
- Evaluating super app strategies
- Diagnosing why cross-sell rates are lower than expected
- Deciding whether to build within an existing app or launch separately
- Understanding gaps between projected and actual adoption of features
