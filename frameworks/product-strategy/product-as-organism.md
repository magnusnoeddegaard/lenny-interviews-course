# Product as Organism

> "All of a sudden, products aren't just these static artifacts that we start to ship... they're living organisms that just get better with the more interactions that happen. I think this is the new IP of every single company—products that think and live and learn." - Asha Sharma

## What It Is

A fundamental shift in how we think about building products. Traditional products are artifacts—you develop an idea, ship it, maybe iterate a bit, then watch a dashboard. Products as organisms are living systems that continuously ingest data, process feedback, and evolve based on interactions.

The key insight is that the model inside your product is no longer static. With powerful foundation models available, the real competitive advantage comes from how you tune and optimize them for specific outcomes. Your product's "metabolism"—its ability to ingest data, digest signals, and produce better outcomes—becomes the core IP.

This applies to all software products, not just AI companies. As Asha puts it: "Software products will all be model-forward products."

## How It Works

The organism model has three core components:

**1. Data Ingestion**
The product continuously captures signals from user interactions. This goes beyond analytics—it includes:
- User acceptances and rejections of suggestions
- Behavioral patterns that indicate preference
- Quality signals from outcomes
- Feedback that can be used for fine-tuning

**2. Digestion (The Rewards Model)**
The data is processed to improve the underlying models:
- Post-training and fine-tuning based on real usage
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback
- Synthetic data generation for specific capabilities
- A/B testing to validate improvements

**3. Outcomes Production**
The improved model produces better results, optimized for specific goals:
- Price (cost efficiency)
- Performance (speed, latency)
- Quality (accuracy, user satisfaction)

## How to Apply It

1. **Design for the feedback loop** - When building features, ask: "What signals will this generate that can improve the system?"

2. **Invest in annotation and labeling** - High-quality labeled data dramatically improves results. One example: annotating 600,000 physician-patient interactions improved acceptance rates from 30-60% to 83%.

3. **Build observability into everything** - You can't improve what you can't measure. Make observability a cultural norm, not an afterthought.

4. **Run multiple improvement tracks** - Don't rely on a single feedback loop. Run parallel tracks like assembly lines, each optimizing different aspects.

5. **Choose the right job to be done** - Post-training is most effective when you have a clear use case. Start with specific problems, not general improvement.

## When to Use It

- When building any AI-powered product feature
- When deciding where to invest engineering resources (infrastructure vs. features)
- When evaluating your competitive moat (your data and feedback loops are often more defensible than features)
- When planning your product roadmap in an AI-native way
