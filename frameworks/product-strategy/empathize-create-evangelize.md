# Empathize-Create-Evangelize

> "There are three pieces if you think about it. So one is what I call empathize. The second is create. And the other is evangelize." - Ebi Atawodi

## What It Is

Developing a vision isn't just about having a great idea - it's a structured process that moves from deep understanding through creation to persistent communication. This three-phase framework provides a complete methodology for vision development that scales across team sizes and company stages.

The lifecycle of a product vision can span years. Ebi set a "Vision 2026" at YouTube that took a year and a half before it entered the planning cycle. The evangelize phase requires patience and persistence through naysayers and challenges.

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Empathize

Before creating a vision, you must deeply understand the customer and their problems. This phase involves:

**Dog-fooding**: Use your own product obsessively. Create multiple accounts. Go through the onboarding flow even if you're not the onboarding PM. Experience the product as a new user would.

**Cat-fooding**: Use competitors' products and adjacent products in the landscape. Understand what others are doing well and poorly.

**Research**: Use foundational research to identify problems that are a couple of cycles out. But don't over-rely on research - you're a human with intuition built from exposure to products.

**Top 10 Things You Should Know**: Maintain a living document of the 10 biggest problems in your area. Update it quarterly. Include qualitative, quantitative, and tech debt issues.

### Phase 2: Create

Transform your understanding into a concrete vision using various formats:

**Once Upon a Time Framework**: Use the Mad Libs-style narrative structure to tell the story of the problem and solution.

**Headline Method**: Write the future news headline and subtitle as if your vision has been realized. Make it look realistic by placing it in a TechCrunch or New York Times template.

**Visual Mock-ups**: Sketch or design what the future state looks like. Use App Store screenshots, product mocks, or hand-drawn sketches.

**Written Vision Document**: Create an evergreen document that describes insights, strategy, and big rocks.

### Phase 3: Evangelize

Sharing the vision through concentric circles of stakeholders:

**Circle 1 - Core Team**: Your direct team needs to buy in first. They're getting on the boat with you. Present multiple times, allow comments, let the idea percolate.

**Circle 2 - Stakeholders**: The people who need to be bought in for success - marketing, operations, support, adjacent teams. They've been heard during the empathize phase, so they're already invested.

**Circle 3 - Leadership**: Go as high as possible. Let your manager pull you back rather than limiting yourself. Leadership buy-in amplifies everything.

## How to Apply It

1. **Block time for empathize work**
   - Create fresh accounts on your product
   - Set up accounts on competitor products
   - Review support tickets and user feedback
   - Start your "Top 10 Problems" document

2. **Run a three-day strategy session**
   - Day 1: Insights - Focus on understand work, teardowns, presenting "10 things you should know"
   - Day 2: Strategy - Which problems to focus on, in what order
   - Day 3: Big Rocks - What are the 3-5 major initiatives

3. **Choose your create format**
   - Start with Once Upon a Time for narrative clarity
   - Write the future headline for focus
   - Sketch or mock the end state for visualization

4. **Plan your evangelism campaign**
   - Start with your immediate team
   - Expand to stakeholders who provided input
   - Present to leadership for endorsement and amplification

## When to Use It

- When developing a new 3-5 year product vision
- When joining a new team or company and need to set direction
- When your current vision feels stale or unclear
- When preparing for annual/strategic planning cycles
- When you need to realign a team that's lost focus
