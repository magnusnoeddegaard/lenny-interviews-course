# Start by Asking What Could Be

> "We have another value of, start by asking, 'What could be?', which is pushing ourselves to be as aspirational, ambitious as possible. So the Peek feature that you mentioned, we just didn't want to solve the problem of context switching. We wanted to almost blur the line between native and web software, and make it feel like a sheet of paper." - Josh Miller

## What It Is

Start by Asking What Could Be is a product development principle that encourages teams to dream big before accepting constraints. Instead of beginning with "what can we do given our resources/timeline/technology," you start with "what would be the most amazing possible outcome for users?"

This value works alongside "Assume You Don't Know"—together they create a mindset of intellectual humility combined with ambitious aspiration. You don't assume you know what's possible, which frees you to imagine bigger than conventional wisdom would allow.

The principle also creates a tactical benefit: when a team is working toward an aspirational vision, they're more deeply motivated than when executing against a narrow requirement. The vision becomes fuel for heartfelt intensity.

## How It Works

The framework operates through several mechanisms:

1. **Vision before constraints**: Start every project by imagining the ideal outcome, regardless of current limitations
2. **Reframe problems as opportunities**: Instead of "solve the context-switching problem," think "reimagine how web and native software interact"
3. **Motivate through aspiration**: Teams work harder when pursuing something genuinely exciting
4. **Accept you might not get there**: The vision is a north star, not a guarantee—but reaching for it pulls you further than incremental thinking would

Example: The Browser Company's Peek feature could have been framed as "reduce friction when opening links." Instead, they framed it as "blur the line between native and web software, make it feel like a sheet of paper." The aspiration shaped everything about the execution.

## How to Apply It

1. **Separate vision from planning**: Have an explicit phase where you dream without constraints before the phase where you make tradeoffs

2. **Ask "what would make this magical?"**: Don't settle for useful or efficient—push for delightful and transformative

3. **Use aspirational language**: Instead of "improving X," talk about "reimagining X" or "redefining X"

4. **Get specific about the ideal**: Vague aspiration isn't useful. "Amazing user experience" means nothing. "Feel like you're flipping through sheets of paper" is actionable.

5. **Let the vision evolve**: As you learn, your understanding of "what could be" might change. That's fine—update the vision.

6. **Connect vision to motivation**: Help team members see how their work contributes to something bigger than the immediate feature.

## When to Use It

- At the start of any new product or feature initiative
- When teams are stuck in incremental thinking
- When competing with incumbents (you need to be dramatically better, not slightly better)
- When you want to attract ambitious talent who want to work on meaningful challenges
- When existing approaches feel stale or uninspired
