# Eigenquestion Method

> "What are the one or two Eigenquestions on this topic? There's no right answer, but sharp product managers, engineers, basically every role, they very quickly find what are the one or two Eigenquestions." - Shishir Mehrotra

## What It Is

The Eigenquestion is the question that, when answered, makes all other questions either irrelevant or answerable. Borrowed from linear algebra (where an eigenvector is the vector that captures the essence of a transformation), an Eigenquestion captures the essence of a decision or problem.

In any complex situation, there are dozens of questions you could ask. Most are secondary or derivative. The Eigenquestion is the one (or two) that fundamentally drives the answer—the question whose answer determines the strategy, approach, or direction.

This is a skill we naturally have as children but often lose as adults. Kids quickly simplify problems to their essence, while adults tend to overcomplicate with secondary concerns.

## How It Works

Shishir illustrates the concept with his "teleportation device" interview question:

**The Setup**: "Scientists have invented a teleportation device and hired you to bring it to market. What do you do?"

Most candidates generate a long list of questions: What size is it? Is it safe? Does it need a receiver? Is it fast? How much does it cost?

**The Constraint**: "You can only ask two questions. What are they?"

Sharp candidates quickly identify questions like:
1. **"Is it safe enough for humans?"** - A crisp way to get at reliability and use cases
2. **"Is it more expensive CapEx or OpEx?"** - Determines the business model

These two questions alone create a 2x2 matrix that unlocks the entire strategy:

| | Cheap to Buy | Expensive to Buy |
|---|---|---|
| **Safe for Humans** | Deploy everywhere like fax machines | Replace airports (strategic placement) |
| **Not Safe for Humans** | Mass goods transport | Specialized high-value cargo |

The Eigenquestion eliminates the need to answer dozens of derivative questions—once you know the answers to these two, everything else follows.

## How to Apply It

1. **Generate the question cloud** - List all the questions you could ask about the problem
2. **Identify dependencies** - Ask "What decision does this question allow me to make?" for each one
3. **Find the root questions** - The Eigenquestions are those that other questions depend on
4. **Test with constraints** - Force yourself to pick only 1-2 questions. What would you ask?
5. **Build the framework** - Use your Eigenquestions to create a decision matrix or framework

**Key test**: If knowing the answer to a question doesn't change your decision, it's not an Eigenquestion.

## When to Use It

- **Product strategy decisions** - Cut through complexity to core strategic questions
- **Interviews** - Use the teleportation device question (or similar) to test candidate's prioritization
- **Problem framing** - When you're overwhelmed with options or data
- **Stakeholder discussions** - Help groups align on what actually matters
- **Personal decisions** - Career choices, investments, major life decisions

**Practice tip**: Shishir does this exercise with his kids. Take any product or situation and ask, "What's the Eigenquestion here?" You can practice with everyday observations—why are there three gas stations on one corner? What's the Eigenquestion for placing a gas station?
