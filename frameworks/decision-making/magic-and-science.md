# Magic and Science Balance

> "We like to talk about this internally, I like this mixture of magic and science... Some companies are very scientific on their product management that they like to measure everything and they do a lot of tests and things, but we just decided we don't think that's necessary or that's good for us." - Karri Saarinen

## What It Is

Magic and Science Balance is a decision-making philosophy that combines deep customer understanding and intuition ("magic") with research and data ("science"), while deliberately avoiding letting data make decisions for you.

The "science" involves talking to users, doing research, and sometimes looking at metrics when you have specific questions. The "magic" is what happens when you build such deep customer understanding that you can use intuition and judgment to make decisions without needing data to validate every choice.

This approach stands in contrast to highly data-driven product management where metrics and A/B tests drive decisions. Linear explicitly rejects that model, choosing instead to build understanding that enables intuitive decision-making.

## How It Works

**The Science:**
- Extensive user research and customer conversations
- Everyone on the team talks to customers regularly
- Shared Slack channels with customers
- Engineers and designers answer customer questions directly
- Looking at metrics when you have a specific question to answer

**The Magic:**
- Using the accumulated understanding to make judgment calls
- Trusting intuition that comes from deep customer knowledge
- Making decisions without requiring data to back them up
- Being willing to make mistakes and correct them

**What makes it work:**
When the whole company builds genuine customer understanding, decisions become informed by reality even without running experiments. You don't need data to tell you what's right if you truly understand the problem and the users.

**What they explicitly don't do:**
- No A/B testing
- No specific metric goals for features
- No letting data "make the decision for us"

## How to Apply It

1. **Invest heavily in customer understanding** - Make talking to customers a regular practice for everyone, not just PMs or researchers

2. **Create multiple feedback channels** - Customer Slack channels, support access for engineers, regular user calls

3. **Share customer context widely** - Record videos, write notes, share learnings with the whole team

4. **Ask questions of data, don't optimize for metrics** - When you're curious about something, look at the data. But don't set goals to move specific numbers.

5. **Build confidence in judgment** - Practice making decisions based on understanding rather than tests. Accept that some will be wrong.

6. **Be okay with uncertainty** - "Sometimes people use data a lot or too much because they're worrying or they're afraid that, will I make the wrong choice?"

7. **Make reversible decisions** - Many decisions can be corrected if wrong. Don't over-invest in validation for reversible choices.

## When to Use It

**Best suited for:**
- Products where user experience and quality are differentiators
- Teams that can maintain close customer relationships
- Products with engaged users who provide rich feedback
- Companies with strong product taste and opinions
- Retention-focused businesses where long-term relationships matter

**Less suitable for:**
- Consumer products with millions of users and low engagement
- Transactional products where optimization matters more than experience
- Products where small conversion improvements have large revenue impact
- Highly competitive markets where marginal gains are decisive

**The trade-off:**
This approach requires genuine investment in customer understanding. You can't use intuition if you don't actually understand the customer. The "magic" only works if you've done the work to earn it.

**Karri's framing:**
"The company still has to be okay that sometimes we make mistakes and we made the wrong choice and then we just can fix it. But at least we made that choice and the data didn't make that choice for us."
