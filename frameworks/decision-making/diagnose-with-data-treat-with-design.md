# Diagnose with Data, Treat with Design

> "What you really want is you want to diagnose with data and treat with design. Data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build or what the solution is." - Julie Zhuo

## What It Is

A framework for understanding the complementary roles of data and design in product development. Data helps you identify and understand problems by reflecting reality, while design provides the creative solutions to those problems.

This framework resolves the tension between data-driven and design-driven approaches by recognizing each has a distinct purpose. Data answers "what is happening?" while design answers "what should we build?"

Data includes not just quantitative metrics but also qualitative signals: customer interviews, social media reactions, user feedback, and anything that helps capture reality. The goal of data is to give you a story that better reflects reality than your assumptions alone.

## How It Works

**Data's role (Diagnosis):**
- Capture reality as objectively as possible
- Identify whether problems exist
- Locate where opportunities lie
- Measure engagement and satisfaction
- Challenge assumptions about user behavior

**Design's role (Treatment):**
- Creative problem-solving
- Inventing solutions
- Dreaming up new possibilities
- Building user experiences
- No formula or science determines the answer

The key insight is that you cannot A/B test your way to a great product. Data won't tell you what to build, but it will tell you if you have a problem and where that problem might be.

## How to Apply It

1. **Use data to understand reality** - Before proposing solutions, gather data to understand what's actually happening. This includes quantitative metrics, user interviews, social media sentiment, and support tickets.

2. **Don't expect data to provide solutions** - Resist the temptation to let metrics dictate what to build. Data reveals problems, not answers.

3. **Apply creative design thinking** - Once you understand the problem through data, engage in a creative process to imagine and design solutions.

4. **Test and iterate** - Use data again to validate whether your design treatment is working, then adjust.

5. **Remember data interpretation is an art** - Choosing which metrics to track and interpreting what a 5% increase means are subjective decisions, not scientific certainties.

## When to Use It

- When designers resist data-driven approaches
- When teams over-rely on A/B testing for product direction
- When balancing quantitative and qualitative inputs
- When deciding how to use analytics in product development
- When explaining the relationship between research and design
