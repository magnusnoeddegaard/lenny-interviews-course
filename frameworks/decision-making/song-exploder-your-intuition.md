# Song Exploder Your Intuition

> "It's cool because you are reverse-justifying decisions. I think that's a really fun exercise to do, is to Song Exploder your intuition. You make a decision intuitively or look at something and intuit what you feel from it, and then really try to dive in, 'Why do I feel that way? What could this have reminded me of that made me feel that way?'" - Jessica Hische

## What It Is

Named after the podcast that breaks down songs into their component parts, "Song Exploder Your Intuition" is a self-awareness practice for understanding why you feel a certain way about design, decisions, or creative work. Instead of just accepting or dismissing gut feelings, you deliberately deconstruct them to find their origins.

This technique helps you build a vocabulary around your intuitive responses, making them more actionable and shareable with others. It transforms vague feelings into concrete insights you can use for decision-making and communication.

## How It Works

The process involves three phases:

**Phase 1: Notice the Feeling**
- Look at something (design, logo, font, product)
- Identify your initial emotional reaction without judgment
- Don't overthink - capture the first impression

**Phase 2: Trace the Origin**
- Ask: "Why do I feel that way?"
- Dig into memories and associations
- Be forgiving and loose with yourself - let weird connections surface

**Phase 3: Extract the Pattern**
- What experiences might have created this association?
- What elements trigger this feeling across different examples?
- Can others have adjacent experiences that produce similar reactions?

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with a clear reaction** - "That feels calm" or "That feels aggressive"
2. **Ask the first why** - "Why does it feel calm?"
3. **Get specific** - "It reminds me of the stationery in my grandmother's study"
4. **Generalize the pattern** - "Soft, rounded edges with muted colors feel vintage and comforting"
5. **Test the pattern** - Does this hold for other examples?

### Example Walkthrough

Looking at a script typeface:
- *Feeling*: "This feels very formal and feminine"
- *First why*: "It reminds me of wedding invitations"
- *Memory trace*: "Every wedding I've attended had this style of lettering"
- *Pattern*: "This style has been usurped by the wedding industry"
- *Insight*: "Using this for my tech startup would send the wrong signals"

## When to Use It

- When making design decisions you need to explain to stakeholders
- When evaluating options and need to articulate preferences
- When building creative intuition and developing taste
- When stuck on a decision that "feels wrong" but you can't say why
- When onboarding others into your design philosophy
