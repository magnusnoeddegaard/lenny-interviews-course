# Common Currency Quantification

> "We spend a lot of time quantifying things in terms of a common currency. If I were to lower price by a dollar, what would I get in terms of volume? What if I lowered delivery times by a minute? Now you can make trade-offs between maybe your marketing team and your logistics team because you have this common currency that everyone can talk about." - Jessica Lachs

## What It Is

A decision-making framework where you quantify the impact of every major business lever in terms of the same outcome metric (your "common currency"). This allows you to directly compare investments across completely different domains - like marketing spend vs. logistics improvements vs. product features - and make optimal resource allocation decisions.

At DoorDash, this means knowing what a dollar of price reduction is worth in volume, versus what a minute of faster delivery is worth, versus what signing a new restaurant is worth. With this knowledge, teams can quickly determine where to invest limited resources.

## How It Works

**Core Concept:**
Transform apples-to-oranges comparisons into apples-to-apples by expressing all improvements in the same unit (e.g., GOV, orders, revenue, users).

**What You Quantify:**
- Price changes → Volume impact
- Delivery time improvements → Volume impact
- Selection expansion (new restaurants/stores) → Volume impact
- Quality improvements → Volume impact
- Marketing spend → Volume impact
- Operational efficiency → Volume impact

**Benefits:**
1. **Speed**: Decisions that would take weeks of analysis can be made quickly
2. **Alignment**: Cross-functional teams can have productive conversations about trade-offs
3. **Optimization**: You can mathematically determine where the marginal dollar/hour creates the most value
4. **Inventory**: You build a library of "moves" you can make and know what each is worth

## How to Apply It

1. **Define your common currency**: Pick your primary output metric - typically volume, revenue, GMV, or orders. This is what everything will be translated into.

2. **Identify your major levers**: List all the significant ways you can influence your business: pricing, product quality, speed, selection, marketing channels, operational improvements, etc.

3. **Build the translation models**: For each lever, analyze historical data and run experiments to understand the relationship:
   - If we lower price by X%, volume increases by Y%
   - If we improve delivery time by X minutes, volume increases by Y%
   - If we add X restaurants in a market, volume increases by Y%

4. **Account for timeframes**: Note whether impacts are immediate, short-term, or long-term. A marketing campaign might have immediate impact; a quality improvement might compound over time.

5. **Create decision tools**: Build dashboards or models that let teams quickly compare investment options

6. **Update continuously**: As your business evolves, the translations change. Regularly validate and update your models.

## When to Use It

- When allocating budget across multiple teams or initiatives
- When trying to compare investment in product vs. marketing vs. operations
- When building business cases that need to be comparable to other initiatives
- When running a multi-sided marketplace where you need to balance investments across sides
- When prioritizing roadmaps and need to quantify impact consistently
