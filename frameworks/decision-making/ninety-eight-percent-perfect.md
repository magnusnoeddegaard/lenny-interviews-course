# 99.8% Perfect

> "There's some weird knowledge around understanding that nothing is ever 100% perfect, and the most you can aspire and get to is 99.8 or whatever. That last 0.2%, you could spend your whole life trying to do that, or you could move on and do other things and understand that it's nearly perfect." - Jessica Hische

## What It Is

The 99.8% Perfect principle acknowledges a fundamental truth about creative and professional work: true perfection is mathematically impossible, and the pursuit of that final fraction of a percent has massively diminishing returns. Once you've reached "nearly perfect," the wise choice is to ship and move on.

This isn't an excuse for mediocrity - it's a recognition that the difference between 99.8% and 100% is imperceptible to anyone except perhaps yourself, while the time cost of chasing that difference is enormous. That same time invested in a new project has far greater total value.

## How It Works

**The Diminishing Returns Curve:**
- 0-80%: Relatively fast progress
- 80-95%: Slower but still worthwhile
- 95-99%: Much slower, high effort per unit of improvement
- 99-99.8%: Reasonable endpoint for professional work
- 99.8-100%: Impossible; could consume infinite time

**The Decision Framework:**
1. Is this good enough that I'm proud of it? (Yes = ship)
2. Would any additional time spent meaningfully improve the outcome? (No = ship)
3. Is the remaining imperfection visible to anyone but me? (No = ship)

## How to Apply It

1. **Define "nearly perfect" upfront** - What does 99.8% look like for this project?
2. **Notice when you're in diminishing returns** - The feeling of tiny changes for huge effort
3. **Get external validation** - Others often can't see what you're obsessing over
4. **Ship and iterate** - The remaining 0.2% might not be what you think it is anyway
5. **Redirect your energy** - Use saved time for new projects or improvements that matter more

### Signs You're Chasing 0.2%

- You're making changes others can't perceive
- You've lost sight of what you're optimizing for
- Stakeholders have approved but you're still tweaking
- You're justifying continued work with "but it could be better"
- Time spent vastly exceeds expected value created

## When to Use It

- When perfectionism is preventing shipping
- When deciding how much polish a deliverable needs
- When time-boxing creative work
- When coaching others who over-refine
- When choosing between perfecting one thing vs. doing two things well

## When It Doesn't Apply

- Safety-critical systems where 99.8% means failures
- Work where small differences create large downstream impacts
- Situations where "nearly perfect" creates legal/compliance risk
- When learning, where pushing to 100% builds capability
