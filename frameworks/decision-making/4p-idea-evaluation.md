# 4P Idea Evaluation

> "Start with the potential outcome, then look at probability—not the other way around—because then you're going to apply that mental filter and throw out ideas that may not have been worth throwing out." - Dharmesh Shah

## What It Is

4P Idea Evaluation is a systematic framework for evaluating startup ideas, new products, or business opportunities. It forces you to consider four dimensions: Potential, Probability of success, Passion/Proximity, and Prowess (your unfair advantage).

The key insight is the order of evaluation matters. Most people evaluate probability first, filtering out ideas before considering their potential. This causes you to discard high-potential ideas that might be worth pursuing despite lower odds.

## How It Works

Imagine an Excel spreadsheet with four columns, each scored 0-10:

### 1. Potential (Evaluate First!)
"If this thing were successful, what could it be?"
- What's the magnitude of the outcome?
- Could be measured as revenue, market cap, impact, portfolio diversity
- Ask this BEFORE considering probability

### 2. Probability of Success
"What are the realistic odds?"
- Use expected value thinking: 10% chance at $100M = $10M expected value
- A 50% chance at $10M vs 10% chance at $500M—mathematically, consider the second one
- Factor in multiple scenarios (probability × outcome for each)

### 3. Passion (or Proximity)
"Do you care about this? Can you work on it for years?"
- Is this something you can work on for 2, 10, 20 years?
- Do you have passion for the problem or market segment?
- Note: You don't need to start with passion—you can develop it. "It's okay to become passionate about something as you dig into it."

### 4. Prowess
"Why you? Why would you succeed?"
- What assets do you bring? Existing code, market access, domain expertise?
- What makes you uniquely positioned?
- How does your unfair advantage affect probability?

## How to Apply It

1. **Create the spreadsheet** - List your ideas as rows, four P's as columns

2. **Score Potential first** - Resist the urge to filter by probability before considering upside. "Most common mistake: thinking through probability first without forcing yourself to think through potential."

3. **Calculate expected values** - For probability, think through multiple scenarios and their weighted outcomes

4. **Be honest about passion** - If you're a first-time founder, you may not know your passion. That's okay—look for problems you find genuinely interesting.

5. **Articulate your prowess** - "Why me? Why my company? Why would we succeed at this? Why is our chance of success, even if low, higher than the rest of the world?"

6. **No single factor decides** - Don't just pick the highest expected value. Look at all factors together in context of your situation.

## When to Use It

- Evaluating startup ideas
- Prioritizing new product opportunities within an existing company
- Deciding between job opportunities (can apply same framework)
- Portfolio planning and resource allocation
- Any high-stakes decision with multiple options

The framework is particularly valuable because it:
- Prevents premature filtering of high-potential ideas
- Forces explicit consideration of unfair advantages
- Acknowledges that passion can develop over time
- Provides structure for inherently messy decisions
