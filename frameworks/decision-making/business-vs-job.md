# Business vs Job Distinction

> "There's a big difference between a business and a job. I think if you could start a pressure washing business where you're the only employee, yeah, that's a job, but if you can get to a scale where you can drive 10 leads a day, then you don't have to do any of the pressure washing and you just do what you love." - Andrew Wilkinson

## What It Is

This framework helps entrepreneurs distinguish between truly starting a business versus creating a job for themselves. Many "businesses" are actually jobs in disguise—the founder trades time for money with no path to leverage, freedom, or scale.

The core question: Will this eventually run without your daily involvement, or will you be trapped doing the work forever?

## How It Works

**A Job (disguised as a business):**
- You are the product (your time, expertise, labor)
- Revenue stops when you stop working
- No leverage or scale potential
- You've created employment for yourself, not a business

**A Business:**
- The system creates value, not just your labor
- Can grow beyond your personal capacity
- Potential to hire others to do the work
- You can focus on what you enjoy and are best at

**The Scale Test:**
Ask: "At 10x the current size, would I still be doing the parts I dislike?"
- If yes → you're building a job
- If no → you're building a business

## How to Apply It

1. **Evaluate potential ventures:**
   - Can this generate leads/sales independent of my time?
   - Can I hire people to do the delivery/operations?
   - Do the margins support hiring help eventually?
   - Is there a ceiling on growth tied to my personal capacity?

2. **Design for scale from the start:**
   - Build systems that others can follow
   - Document processes as you develop them
   - Plan for the role you want, not just the role you need to play now

3. **Watch for job-creation traps:**
   - Consulting where you are the only consultant
   - Service businesses where clients expect you personally
   - Creative work that can't be delegated
   - Businesses with margins too thin for hiring

4. **Create the upgrade path:**
   - What revenue level enables your first hire?
   - What tasks will you delegate first?
   - What's your role when the business has 10 employees?

## Examples

**Job (likely):**
- One-person cafe where you make every drink
- Freelance consultant where clients hire you specifically
- Solo pressure washer doing all the work yourself

**Business (potential):**
- Cafe chain with systems that managers can run
- Consulting firm with methodology others can deliver
- Pressure washing company with 10 leads/day driving employee crews

**The Milk Test (from the transcript):**
A friend started a coffee shop thinking it would be creative and fun. Reality: "I thought I was starting a coffee shop, but I'm just replacing milk and buying milk all day. That's my job now."
