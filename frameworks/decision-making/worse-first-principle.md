# Worse First Principle

> "Everything you want is on the other side of worse first." - Graham Weaver

## What It Is

The Worse First Principle is the recognition that virtually every positive change in life requires an initial period of discomfort, difficulty, or deterioration. The first move toward improvement is almost always negative. Understanding this prevents you from staying stuck by optimizing for tomorrow's comfort instead of long-term growth.

Graham Weaver calls this "almost universally true" across domains: fitness, relationships, careers, and business. It explains why people plateau—they're unwilling to endure the temporary "worse" required to reach the "better."

## How It Works

### The Pattern

Every meaningful change follows this trajectory:

**Current state** → **Initial decline (worse first)** → **Growth** → **New, better state**

The problem: if you optimize for having a great day tomorrow, you stay in the current state. The first step toward change is always negative.

### Examples

**Better body:**
- Worse first: Set alarm earlier, go to gym, get sore, change diet
- Tomorrow is worse if you start today
- Long-term is dramatically better

**Career change:**
- Worse first: Leave comfort zone, interview, learn new skills, feel incompetent
- Tomorrow is worse (uncertainty, discomfort, rejection)
- Long-term: Work you love

**Ending a bad relationship:**
- Worse first: Hard conversation, tears, loneliness, dating apps
- Tomorrow is worse if you break up today
- Long-term: Freedom, better relationship

**Starting a company:**
- Worse first: Give up salary, security, status, face uncertainty
- Tomorrow is worse if you start today
- Long-term: Autonomy, potential wealth, meaningful work

### The Plateau Trap

"So many people I see have this happen, where they hit a plateau and they never move past it, because they're not willing to have that hard day, month, week, year."

The plateau occurs because:
1. Current state is comfortable enough
2. Next step requires temporary discomfort
3. Brain optimizes for avoiding near-term pain
4. Person stays stuck indefinitely

## How to Apply It

### Step 1: Reframe the Question

Instead of asking: "What will make tomorrow better?"
Ask: "What would my five-year self wish I was starting right now?"

"I can guarantee your five-year version of yourself will say, 'Get out of that toxic relationship, no matter how painful it is for the next two months.'"

### Step 2: Expect the Dip

When starting something new, plan for it to get worse:
- Budget for the discomfort
- Don't interpret early struggle as failure
- Remember: the "worse first" phase is temporary, the "better" is permanent

### Step 3: Measure Long-Term, Not Daily

If you evaluate progress daily, every positive change looks like a mistake on Day 1. Zoom out:
- How will this look in 6 months?
- In 2 years?
- In 10 years?

### Step 4: Use Pre-Commitment

Because the worse-first phase is so uncomfortable, pre-commit before you're in it:
- Tell others your plan
- Make deposits/investments
- Schedule the thing
- Remove the option to bail

## When to Use It

- **When you're stuck** - Recognize that staying comfortable is the cause
- **When facing change** - Reframe initial discomfort as expected, not alarming
- **When others are stuck** - Help them see they're optimizing for tomorrow
- **When evaluating progress** - Don't quit during the "worse first" phase
- **When something feels hard** - Ask if this is the healthy kind of hard that precedes growth

## The Complementary Truth

Graham pairs this with another insight: "Life is suffering. So figure out something worth suffering for."

If discomfort is unavoidable in both staying and changing, choose the discomfort that leads somewhere meaningful.
