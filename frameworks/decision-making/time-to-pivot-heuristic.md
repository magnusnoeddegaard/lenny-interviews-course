# Time to Pivot Heuristic

> "I would look at how many more ideas the founder has on how to make it grow. If it's not going well and you're out of ideas, that is usually a good time to pivot. But when you have half a dozen or a dozen really good growth ideas that you haven't tried yet, try them." - Dalton Caldwell

## What It Is

A simple decision framework for determining whether to persist with a struggling startup or pivot to something new. The key signal isn't metrics, runway, or external feedback—it's whether you still have untried ideas for growth.

This heuristic comes from Dalton Caldwell's experience working with over 1,000 YC startups. It recognizes that startups fail when founders lose creative energy and hope, not when they run out of money.

## How It Works

**The Core Question**

Ask yourself: "How many good growth ideas do I have that I haven't tried yet?"

- **Lots of ideas → Keep going**: You have untapped potential
- **Out of ideas → Consider pivoting**: You've exhausted your creative options

**Why This Works**

1. **Ideas are signal**: Having growth ideas means you still understand the problem space deeply
2. **Energy matters**: Running out of ideas often correlates with running out of motivation
3. **Execution trumps strategy**: Having ideas you believe in enables execution
4. **The Airbnb example**: They "tried all sorts of stuff including cereal and conventions"—they never ran out of zany ideas

## The Airbnb Test

The Airbnb founders persisted through years of struggle because they always had another idea to try:
- Professional photography for listings
- Selling cereal boxes during political conventions
- Going to New York to meet hosts personally
- Targeting specific events and gatherings

"They had a bunch of zany ideas on growth and they didn't run out of them."

This is the behavior pattern of founders who eventually succeed: they're overflowing with ideas for how to make it work.

## How to Apply It

**Take Inventory**

List out every growth tactic, feature idea, market segment, or pivot angle you haven't tried yet:
- Marketing channels unexplored
- Customer segments untargeted
- Features that might unlock growth
- Partnerships unpursued
- Pricing models untested

**Assess Quality**

Not all ideas are equal. Look for ideas that:
- You're genuinely excited about
- Seem plausible based on customer feedback
- You have the capability to execute
- Could make a meaningful difference

**Red Flag: Desperate Ideas**

When your best remaining ideas sound like:
- "Maybe we should pay influencers or something"
- "We could just try more ads"
- "What if we added AI/blockchain/[buzzword]?"

These low-quality, generic ideas are a signal you're actually out of ideas.

**Green Flag: Genuine Ideas**

When your ideas are:
- Specific to your product and customers
- Based on observations or insights
- Things you're genuinely curious to try
- Connected to real user behavior or feedback

## The Emotional Dimension

Running out of ideas often correlates with:
- Losing love for the problem
- Conflict with co-founders
- General burnout and exhaustion
- Loss of belief in the mission

The ideas heuristic captures this emotional state indirectly. When you still love what you're doing, ideas flow naturally.

## When to Use It

- You're questioning whether to continue
- The startup is struggling to grow
- You're having the "should we pivot?" conversation
- You need an objective way to assess the situation

## Combining with Other Signals

This heuristic works well with:
- **Kill Criteria**: Pre-committed conditions for quitting
- **Just Don't Die**: The philosophy of persistence
- **Good Pivot Criteria**: Where to pivot if you decide to

The ideas heuristic helps you decide *whether* to pivot; the Good Pivot Criteria helps you decide *where*.
