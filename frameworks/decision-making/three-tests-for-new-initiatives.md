# Three Tests for New Initiatives

> "One, is it a big idea? And then second, is it something we should be doing? So if maybe you have an idea, if you have this new way to extract oil from shale, is it a big idea? Yeah, probably could be a big idea. Is it something Amazon should be doing? Probably not. And the third test, is there a legitimate plan to succeed?" - Jeff Bezos via Ian McAllister

## What It Is

The Three Tests for New Initiatives is a simple but powerful framework for evaluating whether to invest in a new product, feature, or business opportunity. Ian McAllister learned this directly from Jeff Bezos during a lunch conversation where he asked Bezos about his criteria for investing in something new.

All three tests must pass—not just one or two. A brilliant idea that isn't right for your company, or a perfect strategic fit without a viable plan, shouldn't move forward. The framework prevents companies from pursuing shiny objects and keeps focus on initiatives that can actually succeed.

## How It Works

**Test 1: Is it a big idea?**
- Could this meaningfully impact customers or the business?
- Is the addressable opportunity significant?
- Would success be worth celebrating?

**Test 2: Is it something we should be doing?**
- Does it align with our mission, capabilities, and strategic direction?
- Are we uniquely positioned to win here?
- Does it leverage our existing strengths?

**Test 3: Is there a legitimate plan to succeed?**
- Have we identified the key hurdles (technical, financial, operational)?
- Do we have the resources and capabilities needed?
- Is the path to success plausible, not just possible?

## How to Apply It

1. **Use as a Filter**: Before investing significant resources, explicitly run any initiative through all three tests.

2. **Be Honest About Test 2**: This is where many companies fail. Just because you *could* do something doesn't mean you *should*.

3. **Document the Plan**: Test 3 requires more than optimism. Write down the key assumptions, risks, and milestones.

4. **Apply at Multiple Stages**: Use these tests during ideation, after discovery, and before major resource commitments.

5. **Share the Framework**: When rejecting ideas, explain which test failed. This teaches others to self-filter.

## When to Use It

- When evaluating new product proposals
- During strategic planning and roadmapping
- When prioritizing between multiple opportunities
- Before committing significant engineering resources
- When stakeholders propose "great ideas" that might not be right for you

## Examples

**Passes All Three:**
- Amazon Prime (big idea: loyalty at scale; should do: retail core; plan: subscription mechanics proven)

**Fails Test 2:**
- Amazon entering oil extraction (might be big, but not their business)

**Fails Test 3:**
- Many startup pivots (idea is good, fit is good, but no realistic path)

## Connection to Working Backwards

The third test—"legitimate plan to succeed"—is largely what the FAQ portion of Amazon's Working Backwards process validates. The Press Release tests the first two (is this a big, compelling idea that solves a real customer problem in our domain?), while the FAQ tests whether there's a credible plan to actually deliver it.
