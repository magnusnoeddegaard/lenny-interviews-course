# Avoidance Invitation Paradox

> "Whatever emotion that you're trying to avoid, you are inviting into your life in exactly the way that you're trying to avoid it." - Joe Hudson

## What It Is

The Avoidance Invitation Paradox describes how our strategies to escape certain emotional experiences systematically create those exact experiences. The way we try to avoid a feeling becomes the very mechanism that invites that feeling into our lives.

This isn't about karma or cosmic justice—it's a predictable psychological pattern. When you refuse to feel something, you make decisions and take actions designed to avoid that feeling. Those avoidance behaviors create the conditions that produce the very feeling you were trying to escape.

The insight offers a powerful diagnostic and solution: any recurring problem in your life can be traced back to an emotion you're avoiding. Identify the avoided emotion, become willing to feel it, and the problem dissolves.

## How It Works

**Example: The conflict-avoidant executive**
- Emotion avoided: Feeling out of control when people argue
- Avoidance strategy: Avoid all conflict
- Result: Decisions don't get made, tension builds, people get upset, organization feels chaotic
- Outcome: The CEO feels completely out of control—the exact feeling they were avoiding

**Example: Fear of abandonment**
- Emotion avoided: Emotional abandonment
- Avoidance strategy: Get controlling when people seem to leave, or caretake people to keep them close
- Result: Controlling behavior pushes people away; caretaking builds resentment
- Outcome: People abandon you—the exact experience you feared

**Example: Relationship arguments**
- Emotion avoided: Shame
- Avoidance strategy: Defend yourself when criticized
- Result: Defending creates fights
- Outcome: Feel more ashamed after the fight—the exact feeling you were avoiding

## How to Apply It

**Reverse-engineering your problems:**

1. **Identify a recurring problem** - "I'm constantly in arguments with my partner"

2. **Find the avoided emotion** - "What feeling am I trying not to feel in these situations?" → "I don't want to feel ashamed"

3. **Trace the mechanism** - "What do I do to not feel ashamed?" → "I defend myself" → "Defending starts the fight" → "The fight makes me feel more ashamed"

4. **Become willing to feel it** - The solution isn't better avoidance tactics. It's becoming okay with the original feeling.

5. **Try a new response** - "God damn it, you didn't take out the trash" → Feel the shame without defending → "You're right, I'm sorry" OR "I don't feel ashamed about that, I just don't want to take out the trash"

## When to Use It

- When the same problem keeps appearing in your life
- When you're stuck in repeating patterns
- When you're feeling trapped or out of options
- When analyzing team or organizational dysfunction
- When coaching others through recurring issues
