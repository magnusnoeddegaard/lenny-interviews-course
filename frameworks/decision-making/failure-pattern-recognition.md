# Failure Pattern Recognition

> "What we're good at is knowing what failure looks like... The best way for us to sort of not predict, but the best way for us to make more companies succeed is to tell them how they might fail." - Gustaf Alstromer

## What It Is

Failure Pattern Recognition is YC's approach to startup advising: rather than trying to predict which companies will become massive successes (which Gustaf admits they can't do), they focus on identifying and preventing known failure patterns. After working with 600+ startups, YC partners have seen the same mistakes repeatedly and can help founders avoid them.

The insight is that preventing failure is more actionable than predicting success.

## How It Works

### What YC Can't Do

Gustaf is direct about limitations:

"We're not very good at knowing what's going to succeed. Certainly we cannot figure out who's going to be the really successful company in the batch. That's not possible."

Outlier success is unpredictable because:
- The best ideas seem crazy at first (Airbnb, etc.)
- Success depends on factors that can't be observed early
- Hot sectors, investor interest, and press coverage are uncorrelated with outcomes

### What YC Can Do

"What we're good at is knowing what failure looks like."

Common failure patterns they've observed hundreds of times:
1. Not talking to customers
2. Not having technical co-founders
3. Building without validation
4. Fearing rejection
5. Strategy without execution
6. Mistaking investor interest for product-market fit

### The Advice Framing

Gustaf tells founders: "If you fail, please do it in some new exciting way. Not one that we've seen 100 times."

This reframes the relationship: YC isn't picking winners, they're helping good teams avoid known failure modes.

### Why This Works Better

For a team with potential:
- Avoiding 5 known failure patterns might be the difference
- Basic mistakes kill more startups than lack of vision
- Pattern recognition is teachable; outlier instincts are not

## How to Apply It

### Build Your Own Pattern Library

Document failure patterns you've observed:
1. What mistake was made?
2. What were the warning signs?
3. What would have prevented it?
4. How do you detect this pattern early?

### For Advisors and Investors

Focus feedback on:
- "Here's how companies like yours typically fail"
- "This pattern reminds me of X, who failed because..."
- "The risk I see is Y - here's how to mitigate it"

Rather than:
- "I think you'll be huge"
- "This idea is a winner"
- "You remind me of [successful company]"

### For Founders (Self-Assessment)

Regularly ask:
1. What are the known failure modes for companies like ours?
2. Are we exhibiting any warning signs?
3. What would a YC partner tell us we're doing wrong?
4. Are we failing in a boring, predictable way?

### The "New and Exciting Failure" Test

If your startup is struggling, ask: "Is this failure predictable or novel?"

**Predictable failures** (boring, fixable):
- Not talking to customers enough
- Building before validating
- Spending money before product-market fit
- Technical debt from contractor code

**Novel failures** (at least interesting):
- Market shifted unexpectedly
- Regulatory change destroyed the business
- Better-funded competitor emerged
- Technical approach turned out impossible

Predictable failures are preventable. Novel failures are learning opportunities.

## The Outlier Exception

Gustaf notes that truly successful companies often defy pattern recognition:

"If you look at startups on a typical YC batch, there'd be a couple billion companies. Those are the outliers. They'll almost certainly have all the things that we've talked about [avoiding failure patterns]. Many other companies in the batch will have that too, but then what makes someone a true outlier is something that is unknown."

Avoiding failure patterns is necessary but not sufficient for massive success. But it's the controllable part.
