# Steel Man the Other Side

> "One thing I found super effective in those contexts is I try to ask the other side. So, let's take the profitability side. I ask them to make the growth case. I say, 'Tell me the three best reasons why we should actually focus on growth here.' That generates instant empathy for the other side." - Keith Yandell

## What It Is

A facilitation technique for breaking deadlocks in high-stakes debates: ask each side to articulate the strongest possible case for the opposing position. This forces participants to truly understand (not just dismiss) the other perspective and often reveals that the disagreement is smaller than it appears—or helps people persuade themselves.

Unlike straw-manning (attacking the weakest version of an argument), steel-manning requires engaging with the best version. When you must articulate why your opponent might be right, you move from adversarial debate to collaborative problem-solving.

## How It Works

### The Setup

Keith describes a common scenario at DoorDash: two business line GMs arguing over a strategic trade-off—one optimizing for profitability, another for growth. Both have strong perspectives and good reasons. Both want to hit their numbers. The debate is getting nowhere.

### The Technique

Instead of letting each side argue their own position more forcefully:

1. **Ask the profitability advocate**: "Tell me the three best reasons why we should actually focus on growth here."

2. **Ask the growth advocate**: "Tell me the three best reasons why we should focus on profitability here."

### What Happens

**Instant empathy**: When you articulate someone else's position fairly, you understand it differently than when you're just rebutting it.

**Self-persuasion**: Sometimes people convince themselves while explaining the other side. Keith notes: "And sometimes, they'll even persuade themselves as they're talking and say, 'I think you're right that we should focus on growth here.'"

**Smaller disagreements**: Often the debate was about emphasis, not direction. Steel-manning reveals the underlying agreement.

**Better solutions**: Understanding both positions deeply enables creative synthesis.

## How to Apply It

1. **Wait for the deadlock** - Don't intervene while productive debate is happening. Use this when positions have hardened.

2. **Frame it clearly** - "Before we continue, I want to try something. [Name], can you give me the three strongest arguments for [opposing position]?"

3. **Require genuine effort** - Weak steel-manning defeats the purpose. Push for: "What's the *best* version of that argument?"

4. **Do it symmetrically** - Both sides must do it, or it feels punitive.

5. **Use the insight** - Don't just move on. "Now that you've articulated that, how does it change your thinking?"

### Supporting Elements

Keith pairs this technique with two other moves:

**Clarify the decision maker**: "We're all going to come together. We're going to have a healthy debate. We're going to make sure everyone's perspectives are heard. We're going to try to reach consensus, but at the end of the day, here's the person that's going to make the decision."

**Set a time horizon**: Decisions have deadlines. Open-ended debates drift. "We're going to make it on this time horizon."

## When to Use It

- **Executive/leadership meetings** with competing priorities
- **Strategic debates** where reasonable people disagree
- **Cross-functional conflicts** where teams optimize for different metrics
- **Any deadlock** where both sides have legitimate points
- **When emotions are running high** - the cognitive shift helps

## When NOT to Use It

- **Clear right/wrong situations** - If someone's just wrong, don't pretend there's a debate
- **Values conflicts** - Some disagreements are about principles, not analysis
- **Time pressure** - This takes time; sometimes you just need a decision
- **When one side is being bad faith** - Steel-manning requires good faith from all

## The Psychology

This works because of several cognitive shifts:

1. **Perspective-taking** - Literally stepping into another's shoes
2. **Reducing defensiveness** - Hard to defend when you're explaining the attack
3. **Cognitive dissonance** - Articulating a position creates mild commitment to it
4. **Face-saving** - Easier to change your mind when you demonstrated understanding
