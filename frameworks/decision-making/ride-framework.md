# RIDE Framework

> "Being clear on who the decision maker is in a change is really important." - Heidi Helfand

## What It Is

RIDE is a decision-making clarity framework that identifies four distinct roles in any organizational decision. By explicitly defining who fills each role, teams avoid confusion, reduce politics, and make faster decisions.

The framework was taught to Heidi Helfand by Pat Wadors (former Chief People Officer at Procore, now at UKG). It's particularly useful during organizational changes, reorgs, and any situation where multiple people are involved in making decisions.

## How It Works

### The Four Roles

**R - Requester**
- The person or team requesting the change
- Identifies the problem or opportunity
- Initiates the decision-making process

**I - Input**
- People who can give input to the change
- Subject matter experts, stakeholders, affected parties
- Their perspective informs the decision but doesn't determine it

**D - Decider**
- The person who makes the final decision
- Has authority and accountability for the outcome
- Only one person should be the decider (no committees)

**E - Executor**
- People who will execute on the change
- Responsible for implementation
- May overlap with Input roles

## How to Apply It

Before any significant decision:

1. **Map the roles explicitly** - Write down who fills each RIDE role
   - Who is requesting this change?
   - Who should give input?
   - Who will make the final decision?
   - Who will execute?

2. **Communicate the roles** - Make sure everyone knows their role
   - Input-givers know their input is valued but won't be the deciding factor
   - The decider knows they have authority and accountability
   - Executors know what's expected of them

3. **Set expectations on participation**
   - Some decisions involve broad input; some don't
   - Being clear prevents hurt feelings when someone's input isn't incorporated
   - Example: Acquisition decisions won't include a standup discussion

4. **Respect the boundaries**
   - Input-givers give input, then let go
   - The decider decides and takes responsibility
   - Executors execute without relitigating the decision

## When to Use It

- **Organizational changes** - Reorgs, team restructuring, role changes
- **Strategic decisions** - Product pivots, major investments, partnerships
- **Policy changes** - New processes, guidelines, or standards
- **Hiring decisions** - Especially for leadership roles
- **Any decision with multiple stakeholders** - Whenever confusion exists about who decides

## Examples

**Scenario: Splitting a team into two**
- R (Requester): Engineering manager who sees the team has grown too large
- I (Input): Team members, product managers, adjacent teams
- D (Decider): VP of Engineering
- E (Executor): New team leads, HR, affected team members

**Scenario: Company acquisition**
- R (Requester): CEO or Board
- I (Input): Due diligence teams, executives
- D (Decider): Board of Directors
- E (Executor): Integration team, acquired company leadership
