# Making the Decision (70% Rule)

> "It's not about making the right decision, it's about making the decision." - Anneka Gupta (as remembered by colleague Rachel Wolan)

## What It Is

Making the Decision is a framework for overcoming analysis paralysis by recognizing that you learn more after committing to a decision than you do by continuing to gather information beforehand. When you have roughly 70% confidence, that's enough to move forward—the remaining 30% will be refined through iteration.

The key insight: not deciding is itself a decision, and usually the worst one. You remain stuck in the hypothetical and gain no new high-quality information.

## How It Works

**The Core Principle:**
- Before commitment: You operate on imprecise, hypothetical information
- After commitment: You get high-fidelity, real-world feedback
- The learning accelerates dramatically once you commit

**The 70% Threshold:**
- If you're ~70% confident, that's enough to decide
- You can iterate on the remaining 20-30% as you learn
- If you don't commit, you don't get new information to iterate on

**The Learning Gap:**
- Analysis gives you hypothetical insights
- Action gives you real insights
- Real insights are almost always more valuable than hypothetical ones

## How to Apply It

1. **Assess your confidence** - Are you at roughly 70% confidence? If so, stop gathering more information and decide.

2. **Document your hypothesis** - Write down what you believe and why. This isn't just for accountability—it's so you can learn when reality differs from expectations.

3. **Commit publicly** - Making a decision real by sharing it with others increases learning velocity.

4. **Plan for iteration** - Build in checkpoints to assess whether your hypothesis was correct and adjust accordingly.

5. **Expect partial waste** - Accept that you might throw away 20% of work. This is better than making no decision at all.

## Creating a Culture of Decisive Action

To help teams embrace this framework, Anneka recommends:

1. **State hypotheses explicitly** - When making decisions, be clear: "Our hypothesis is that [X segment] will pay for this because [Y reason]. Here's our evidence, and here's what we don't know."

2. **Reward learning, not outcomes** - If a decision didn't work out but the team learned something valuable, celebrate that learning.

3. **Review hypotheses, not decisions** - When something fails, go back to the original hypothesis. What did you learn that you couldn't have known before?

4. **Make bad-decision tolerance explicit** - Tell your team: "It's okay if we make bad decisions, as long as we learn from them and get better for next time."

## When to Use It

- When you find yourself asking "If I just had one more data point..."
- When decisions keep getting delayed for more analysis
- When you're operating on imprecise information (which is always in product)
- When the cost of delay exceeds the cost of being 30% wrong
- When you need to build a culture of speed and learning
