# Gell-Mann Amnesia

> "You'll read a newspaper article about a thing about which you are an expert, and you'll be baffled because here is an article that is not just wrong, it's inverted causality... And then you will turn the page of the newspaper and it will be another article about a topic about which you know nothing, and you will read it as if it is the gospel truth." - Boz (referencing Michael Crichton)

## What It Is

Gell-Mann Amnesia, named by author Michael Crichton, describes the phenomenon where you read a news article about something you're an expert in, notice it's completely wrong ("wet sidewalks make rain" level wrong), then turn the page and treat the next article—on a topic you know nothing about—as completely accurate.

The insight is that media accuracy doesn't improve when you don't have expertise to check it. If they got your field wrong, they're likely getting other fields wrong too.

## How It Works

**The Pattern**
1. You read an article about your area of expertise
2. You notice significant errors, mischaracterizations, or inverted causality
3. You're briefly annoyed or amused
4. You turn the page
5. You read the next article and absorb it as fact
6. You forget that the same source just demonstrated unreliability

**Why It Happens**
- We need some source of information about the world
- Skepticism is cognitively expensive
- Reading critically requires effort
- The alternative (distrusting everything) feels paralyzing

**The Application**
Boz applies this to navigating external narratives about your company:
- When your company is down, external critics don't know more than you do
- When your company is up, external praise isn't necessarily accurate either
- Read criticism carefully looking for blind spots, but don't accept it blindly

## How to Apply It

1. **Calibrate Your Trust**
When you read something about a topic you know well, note how accurate it is. Use that calibration for all content from that source.

2. **Maintain Healthy Skepticism**
Don't ignore external perspectives—they may contain pieces you don't know—but don't treat them as gospel either.

3. **Remember Your Expertise**
In your domain, you know more than analysts, journalists, and Twitter. Your eyes and ears have value. Trust yourself.

4. **Integrate Multiple Sources**
No single source gets everything right. Build understanding from multiple perspectives, knowing each has blind spots.

5. **Look for Confirmation Bias**
When external narratives match what you want to believe, be extra skeptical. When they challenge you, consider they might have a point.

## When to Use It

- When reading press coverage of your company or industry
- When analysts or critics have strong opinions about your decisions
- During company downturns when external narratives turn negative
- During company peaks when external narratives turn positive
- When consuming any news about topics outside your expertise
