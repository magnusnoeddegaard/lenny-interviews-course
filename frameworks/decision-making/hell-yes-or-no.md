# Hell Yes or No

> "It's not a yes unless it's a hell yes. You really want enthusiastic consent. Not just, 'Maybe, kinda. I'll try. We'll see.' But 'Yeah, absolutely, let's do this.'" - Kenneth Berger

## What It Is

Hell Yes or No is a commitment assessment framework. The insight is that partial commitments—"maybe," "I'll try," "we'll see"—almost always fail. When someone gives you a lukewarm response, they're telling you they're not fully in. If you accept that response and proceed as if you have agreement, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.

The framework applies to commitments from others (deadlines, decisions, project buy-in) and to your own decision-making about what to pursue.

## How It Works

### The Standard

A response is only a "yes" when it's a **whole-body yes**—when someone's head, heart, and gut are all aligned. Some people call this "enthusiastic consent." You can feel it when you've got one: genuine excitement, energy, forward motion.

Anything short of that is a "no":
- "Maybe"
- "I guess"
- "We'll try"
- "I think we can"
- "Let's see how it goes"

These are all no's dressed up to avoid conflict.

### Why Lukewarm Fails

When you accept a lukewarm commitment:
- The person doesn't show up fully
- Deadlines slip because they weren't really bought in
- Quality suffers because they're not motivated
- Relationships erode because expectations weren't aligned

Kenneth Berger uses the example of a CTO saying "Yeah, I think maybe we can deliver by May 1st." When May 1st comes and the milestone isn't done, you shouldn't be surprised—you didn't have a hell yes.

## How to Apply It

1. **Upgrade your hearing**: Train yourself to notice lukewarm responses. Any hesitation, hedging, or qualification is a signal.

2. **Don't make them wrong**: Recognize that no is a valid response. Everyone gets to say no whenever they want.

3. **Ask for hell yes explicitly**: When you hear lukewarm, ask: "I'm hearing you're not totally sure about this. What would it take to get to a hell yes?"

4. **Find the alternative**: If they can't get to hell yes on your request, find what they can get to hell yes on: "What would be a date you could absolutely commit to?"

5. **Apply it to yourself**: When evaluating opportunities or decisions, check in with your whole body. If you're not feeling genuine excitement, that's information.

## Examples

**Project deadline:**
- Lukewarm: "We should be able to hit Q2"
- Hell yes: "Yes, we can absolutely deliver this by April 15th. I've talked to the team and we're committed."

**Career opportunity:**
- Lukewarm: "It seems like a good opportunity"
- Hell yes: "I can't stop thinking about this. I want to do it."

**Team alignment:**
- Lukewarm: "Sure, I'll go along with the decision"
- Hell yes: "I see why this is the right call. I'm in."

## When to Use It

- Before accepting commitments from others
- When making significant decisions about what to pursue
- In hiring decisions—are you genuinely excited about this candidate?
- When sensing misalignment but having trouble articulating why
- Any time the stakes are high enough that a lukewarm commitment could cause problems

## The Meta-Lesson

Respecting no—both your own and others'—is actually more influential and effective than pushing through weak commitments. When you take someone's no at face value and communicate consequences, they often reconsider: "Oh, if I say no to this deadline, the project goes to someone else? Actually, maybe I can make it work."

By not forcing or coercing, you create space for genuine commitment.
