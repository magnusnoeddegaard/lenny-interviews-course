# Gut and Intuition Decision-Making

> "I've always been intuition driven and gut driven. And frankly, to be honest, I think everyone actually is. Unless you're letting a machine make the decision that's purely rational, if you're asking a human to make it, it's a judgment call. They're bringing to bear thousands of things they know and don't know about that influence them." - Jason Fried

## What It Is

Gut and Intuition Decision-Making is the practice of explicitly acknowledging and trusting the accumulated experience, pattern recognition, and subconscious processing that humans bring to decisions—rather than pretending decisions can or should be purely data-driven.

This isn't anti-data. Data can be one input among many. But the framework challenges the notion that good decisions require quantitative justification. When companies hire executives, they look for "judgment and experience"—not the ability to read spreadsheets. Yet somehow in day-to-day decisions, we pretend data is everything.

The reality is that even people who claim to be "data-driven" are making judgment calls about which data matters, how to interpret it, and what to do with it. Gut and intuition acknowledges this honestly and gives it space.

## How It Works

**The Data-Only Illusion**:
- "Let's see what the numbers say"
- "We need to prove this with data"
- "What does A/B testing show?"
- Pretends decisions can be fully objective
- Ignores everything that can't be measured

**The Gut-Inclusive Reality**:
- "What do you think?"
- "How does this feel?"
- "What's your intuition here?"
- Acknowledges decisions are fundamentally human
- Values experience, taste, and judgment alongside data

**Why Gut Works**:
- Your brain has absorbed thousands of experiences
- Much of your knowledge is implicit, not explicit
- Pattern recognition happens below conscious awareness
- The best decisions often "feel right" before you can articulate why
- Speed matters—you can't data-analyze everything

## How to Apply It

1. **Ask "how does this feel?"**: In product reviews, hiring decisions, strategy discussions—make "feel" a legitimate topic.

2. **Give intuition credit**: When someone says "I think..." don't immediately demand they prove it. Explore where the intuition comes from.

3. **Trust experience**: Someone who's been doing something for 20 years has earned the right to rely on gut. That's what experience produces.

4. **Riff and iterate**: When brainstorming, follow intuitive threads. "What if we tried...?" doesn't need a business case.

5. **In hiring, test for intuition**: Ask candidates what they'd do with more time on a project. See where their gut takes them.

6. **Be honest about uncertainty**: "I don't really know why I'm making this call, but I'm making it." That's okay.

## When to Use It

- Product design decisions where "feel" matters
- Hiring, where judgment is the key quality
- Strategic decisions with too many variables to analyze
- Creative work where data can't lead
- Speed-critical situations where analysis would take too long
