# Fear the New York Times Headline

> "If Amazon has some kind of mistake, it's on Wall Street Journal and CNN... As a leader, I had to think, is what I'm doing going to generate a New York Times headline?" - Ethan Evans

## What It Is

Fear the New York Times Headline is a risk assessment heuristic that forces leaders to consider the public visibility and reputational consequences of their decisions before taking action. It creates a mental circuit breaker that slows down overly aggressive decision-making.

Evans developed this framework after a high-profile launch failure for Jeff Bezos. His natural tendency was to be an "operational cowboy"—prioritizing speed and willingness to gamble. After the failure, he realized that at Amazon's scale, mistakes don't stay internal. They appear on every news website immediately.

The framework acknowledges the value of bias for action while adding a crucial check: some decisions have consequences that extend far beyond the immediate team or project.

## How It Works

Before making significant decisions, especially those involving:
- Product launches
- System changes affecting customers
- Public commitments
- Anything touching sensitive data or trust

Ask yourself:
1. **Could this fail in a way that's newsworthy?**
2. **If it fails, will it be on the front page of a major news outlet?**
3. **Is the speed benefit worth the reputational risk?**

If the answer to the first two questions is "yes," then:
- Be much more careful with the decision
- Add verification steps
- Don't gamble on hitting the date
- Consider beta testing or soft launches instead of surprise announcements

The framework doesn't mean being paralyzed—it means calibrating your risk tolerance to the visibility of potential failure.

## How to Apply It

1. **Classify decisions by visibility**
   - Low visibility: internal process changes, small feature updates
   - Medium visibility: customer-facing changes, significant releases
   - High visibility: public launches, CEO announcements, anything tied to press coverage

2. **Apply appropriate caution**
   - Low: Move fast, bias for action
   - Medium: Standard review processes, incremental rollout
   - High: Beta testing, extensive QA, avoid hard date commitments, prepare rollback plans

3. **Teach your team**
   - Make "Will this be in the New York Times?" a common question in planning sessions
   - Create cultural awareness that not all decisions have equal downside risk

4. **Reframe surprise launches**
   - Evans learned: "The biggest thing I learned with surprise launches is that you're surprised by what doesn't work"
   - Beta test instead of surprising customers
   - Accept that some leaks are better than launching something broken

## When to Use It

- Before any high-profile product launch
- When making decisions that affect customer trust or data
- When your company's brand is on the line
- When leadership is directly involved or watching
- When there's pressure to hit a date that you're uncertain about meeting
- Anytime failure would be publicly visible beyond your organization

**When NOT to use it:**
- For internal experiments and iterations
- For decisions that can be easily reversed
- When paralysis from fear is preventing necessary progress
