# PMPD Evaluation (People, Market, Product, Distribution)

> "There are four things that I care about when I'm looking at really early stage companies: people, market, product, and distribution." - Julia Schottenstein

## What It Is

The PMPD Evaluation framework is a systematic approach for evaluating early-stage companies, whether you're considering joining them as an employee or investing in them. Julia Schottenstein developed this framework from her experience as a VC at NEA and applies it to both contexts.

The key insight is that you won't find a company that scores 10/10 on all four dimensions—so identify which ones are weaker and consider whether you can personally help de-risk those areas.

## How It Works

### The Four Dimensions

#### 1. People

**Core question**: Do you trust this person to lead?

What to look for in founders/CEOs:
- **Range in scale**: Can they paint a compelling big-picture vision AND dive into day-to-day details?
- **Vision articulation**: Do they make you believe in where the industry is going and their role in it?
- **Execution credibility**: Do they understand the real work required?

Julia's example with dbt's founder Tristan:
> "Tristan had this really rare ability to paint a very compelling future of the industry and how dbt was going to be a part of making that vision a reality. But he also was really, really detailed in the day-to-day work. It was that range in scale that made me feel like this is a founder that's very rare."

#### 2. Market

**Core question**: Is the market growing and is there space for a new entrant?

What to look for:
- **Growth trajectory**: Is the overall market expanding?
- **Chaos as opportunity**: Are there market disruptions creating openings?
- **Room for new players**: Can a startup carve out meaningful space?

Julia's example:
> "It was an explosive time in cloud data warehouses... Snowflake went from a 4 billion company to a 12 billion company. That chaos was really the opportunity for dbt because they created orderliness and structure."

#### 3. Product

**Core question**: Are users genuinely excited?

Signals of real product-market fit:
- **Can't stop talking about it**: Users want to share with teammates and other companies
- **Identity formation**: The product becomes part of who they are, not just a tool
- **Organic evangelism**: Users become unpaid advocates

Julia's "spark" test:
> "Can they not stop talking about it? That top-of-mind love and wanting to share what they've found with others is really a great sign you're onto something."

#### 4. Distribution

**Core question**: Do they have an advantage in getting to market?

This is "arguably more important than having a good product." Evaluate:
- **For product-led companies**: Low-friction self-serve? Organic spread? Open source advantage?
- **For enterprise companies**: Do they know how to land complex sales? Network and connections? Track record?

> "Think about their competitive advantage on either the ecosystem or distribution. Not all companies need to be product led. Some are enterprise top-down sales. You want to see a company that's really strong at enterprise OR really strong at bottoms up."

## How to Apply It

### Step 1: Rate Each Dimension

For the company you're evaluating:
- **People**: 1-10, how much do you trust the leadership?
- **Market**: 1-10, how compelling is the market opportunity?
- **Product**: 1-10, how strong is user enthusiasm?
- **Distribution**: 1-10, how differentiated is their go-to-market?

### Step 2: Identify the Weak Spots

No company will be 10/10 on everything. Where are they weakest?

### Step 3: Assess Your Impact

As an employee (vs. investor), you have unique leverage:
> "When you're joining a company, you have the benefit of dedicating your time. Try to think if they're weaker on one dimension, what is it that you bring to the table that could potentially de-risk the success of the company?"

Match your skills to their gaps:
- Weak on product → Can you help build product intuition?
- Weak on distribution → Do you have GTM expertise?
- Weak on market knowledge → Do you understand this space deeply?

### Step 4: Make the Decision

A company that's 10/10 on People and Market but 6/10 on Product and Distribution might be ideal if you can help close those gaps.

## When to Use It

- **Evaluating job opportunities** at early-stage companies
- **Making angel investment** decisions
- **Advising founders** on where to focus improvement
- **Comparing opportunities** when you have multiple options

## The Key Trade-off

You're looking for either:
1. **A company strong in all four** (rare, competitive to join)
2. **A company weak in an area where YOU are strong** (opportunity to make impact)

Companies that are weak in multiple areas with no clear path to fixing them should be avoided.
