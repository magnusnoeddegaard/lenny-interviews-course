# Founder-Centric Investing

> "Investing is all about supporting people much more so than companies themselves. The company itself, it's about the entrepreneur and the person. I strongly believe that great founders create new markets themselves, or they pivot. If they realize that a certain market is not good, they'll figure out a way to move." - Gokul Rajaram

## What It Is

Founder-Centric Investing is an angel investing philosophy that prioritizes the quality of founders over the quality of markets or ideas. Great founders will pivot to find product-market fit, create new markets entirely, or use learnings from failed ventures to succeed on their second attempt. Markets, on the other hand, are static - a good market won't fix a weak founder.

Gokul has practiced this since 2007, starting by investing in friends and colleagues who left to start companies. His biggest mistakes have been sins of omission - not investing in great founders because he over-analyzed their market.

## How It Works

### Why Founders > Markets

**Founders Adapt, Markets Don't:**
- Great founders pivot when things aren't working
- Airbnb famously created a new market for home-sharing
- The Collison brothers immersed themselves in payments before tackling it

**Compounding Relationships:**
- If you invest in a founder's first company, you'll have access to their second
- Failed founders often succeed on attempt two with the same or adjacent space
- If you skip the first company, they won't come back

**Skills Transfer:**
- What makes someone a great founder applies across ventures
- Builder mentality, customer obsession, and grit persist

### What to Look For

**1. Authentic Problem Connection:**
> "The reason they're starting the company is authentic, in that it's a problem that they have observed deeply. Versus, it's something they read about in Tech Crunch."

Look for founders who:
- Have personally experienced the problem
- Have immersed themselves in the space
- Can speak with genuine passion and depth

**2. Mission Over Money:**
> "If this person is constantly talking about revenue and trying to convince you that you're going to get wealthy... that's not the kind of founder that's going to build a really large company."

Avoid founders who:
- Lead with financial projections
- Focus conversations on returns
- Seem mercenary about their motivation

**3. Two-Person Teams:**
> "I've seen solo founders I'm very nervous about because I think no one person has all the skills you need to start a company."

Look for:
- Complementary co-founders (builder + seller)
- Strong existing relationships
- Clear division of responsibilities

**4. Ability to Attract Talent:**
Can they show people lined up to join before they even have funding?

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with founding story** - Always ask founders to tell their founding story and listen for authenticity

2. **Assess problem immersion** - How deeply do they know the space? Did they read one book or live it?

3. **Evaluate motivation** - Is this about solving a problem or making money?

4. **Check team composition** - Is this a strong complementary pair?

5. **Prioritize relationships** - Your relationship with the founder matters more than any single deal

6. **Embrace sins of commission** - You can only lose 1x on bad investments, but missing a great founder costs much more

## The Collison Test

> "Famously, I think the Collison Brothers bought a book, I think on payments, very old book or something... and read it to fully understand. You want people who really immerse themselves in an industry and live and breathe it before they tackle it."

Great founders don't start companies in hot spaces - they start companies in spaces they've deeply studied and authentically care about.

## When to Use It

- Evaluating angel investment opportunities
- Deciding between multiple investment options
- Assessing whether to back first-time founders
- Considering follow-on investments in pivoting companies
