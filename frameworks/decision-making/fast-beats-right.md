# Fast Beats Right

> "Fast beats right. Every time when debating between, do I noodle this for a thousand years and try to come to the perfect solution or do I make a decision and get executing and direction I have conviction on, I consistently see and believe that fast at the end of the day, wins." - Claire Vo

## What It Is

Fast Beats Right is a decision-making heuristic that resolves the tension between speed and perfection in favor of speed. The core insight is that execution and iteration almost always beat extended deliberation—you learn more by doing than by planning.

Claire Vo uses this as her personal life motto. It captures a founder's bias toward action and applies it to organizational decision-making, career choices, and product development.

The framework doesn't argue against quality or thoughtfulness. It argues against the paralysis that comes from waiting for perfect information. When you're debating whether to keep researching or to decide and execute, choose execution.

## How It Works

**The Core Trade-off:**
Every decision presents a choice between:
- **More time** → potentially better decision → slower learning
- **Less time** → good enough decision → faster learning

The framework argues that the learning velocity from executing fast almost always compounds to better outcomes than the marginal improvement from longer deliberation.

**Why It Works:**

1. **Reality beats theory** - You learn more from doing than planning. Execution generates information you can't get from analysis.

2. **Iteration compounds** - Fast iterations mean more cycles. More cycles mean more learning. More learning means better eventual outcomes.

3. **Perfectionism is a trap** - The "right" answer often doesn't exist. Waiting for certainty is waiting forever.

4. **Momentum matters** - Organizations and individuals lose energy during extended deliberation. Fast decisions preserve momentum.

## How to Apply It

1. **Set a decision deadline** - Don't let decisions drift. If you've been thinking about something for too long, force a decision.

2. **Distinguish reversible from irreversible** - Fast beats right especially applies to reversible decisions. For truly irreversible choices, more care is warranted.

3. **Trust your conviction** - If you have a direction you believe in, execute on it. Doubt and second-guessing destroy speed.

4. **Pair with kill criteria** - Decide fast, but pre-commit to signals that would cause you to change course. This makes fast decisions safer.

5. **Model the behavior** - As a leader, demonstrate fast decision-making. Your team's pace follows yours.

## When to Use It

- When you're stuck in analysis paralysis
- When a decision has been debated for too long
- When you have reasonable conviction but not certainty
- When perfectionism is slowing your team
- When choosing between more planning and starting execution
- When coaching someone who over-analyzes

## When to Be Careful

- Truly irreversible decisions with major consequences
- Decisions where the cost of being wrong is catastrophic
- Situations where a bit more time would yield critical information
- When speed is being used to avoid necessary difficult conversations
