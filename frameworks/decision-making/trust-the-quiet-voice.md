# Trust the Quiet Voice

> "Do you know that little voice when you get really still, the quiet one that says you should marry this person, you should take this job, you should start this company? Watch out for that human, they're a bad one." - Jonathan Lowenhar

## What It Is

Jonathan Lowenhar's "Trust the Quiet Voice" framework addresses one of the most important yet overlooked aspects of founder decision-making: intuition. When founders face existential moments—should I sell? should I fire this person? should I break up with my co-founder?—fear is a terrible decision-maker. The lizard brain leads to reactive choices.

The quiet voice is different from the reactive brain. It's the part of you that knows answers before you have "evidence." It's accessible when you get really still, really alone, really quiet. And critically, Lowenhar argues that this voice is who you actually are—not your brain (which is just a tool, a pattern recognition machine), but something deeper.

Where founders get in trouble is when they stop listening to the quiet voice. The mania and chaos of startup life drowns it out. The framework is about intentionally creating conditions to hear it again.

## How It Works

**The Quiet Voice vs. The Brain:**
- Your brain is a tool—pattern recognition, analysis, logic
- You can watch your brain thinking ("look what my brain's doing")
- This means you're not your brain—you're something else
- The quiet voice is that something else
- It's often right when the brain hasn't caught up yet

**How People Access the Quiet Voice:**
- Getting really alone
- Getting really still
- Getting really quiet
- Walking on the beach
- Listening to music
- Working out
- Playing with a pet

**The Conditions for Hearing It:**
- Being "well resourced": slept well, eaten well, enough love in your world
- Removing the noise and chaos
- Separating from the urgent demands of the business
- Not being in fear mode or lizard brain reaction

**Distinguishing Intuition from Reaction:**
- **Intuition:** "I sat with this, I felt it out, I can see it." Comes from stillness.
- **Reaction:** "I should just do this job for them and fire these three people." Comes from fear.

Founder mode that's really just reactive fear is not the same as founder intuition that comes from deep understanding.

## How to Apply It

1. **Recognize existential moments** - When facing major decisions (sell, fire, pivot, break up with co-founder), acknowledge this is a moment where the quiet voice matters.

2. **Create conditions for stillness** - Whatever works for you: walk, workout, meditation, pet time, alone time. Build this into your routine, especially during high-pressure periods.

3. **Ask the question** - When you're in that still state, ask: "What does the quiet voice say about this?" Don't force an answer.

4. **Trust the answer** - Lowenhar says he trusts founder intuition completely. "If the founder says this business is still going to work, or this co-founder is the wrong person, or yes, it's time to sell, I'm in."

5. **Distinguish from fear** - If you got the "answer" in a reactive state, while angry or panicked, that's probably not the quiet voice. Get still again.

6. **Accept delay** - Often founders know the answer (like "this co-founder isn't right") but the lizard brain doesn't want to believe it. It takes time—sometimes a year or more—to act on what the quiet voice already told you.

## When to Use It

- Facing major strategic decisions (pivot, exit, major hire/fire)
- Co-founder relationship tensions
- When data doesn't give a clear answer
- When feeling overwhelmed by competing advice
- When something feels "off" but you can't articulate why
- During periods of high stress and chaos
- When the stakes are existential
