# Question the Assumption

> "Typically, there's an assumption that you have to make for the problem to be real. If you see through those assumptions, usually the problem starts fading away." - Joe Hudson

## What It Is

Question the Assumption is a foundational tool for transformation that reveals how problems depend on unexamined beliefs to exist. Every problem contains hidden assumptions, and when you examine these assumptions closely, problems often dissolve on their own.

Joe Hudson identifies this as one of five foundational tools for personal transformation. The insight isn't about solving problems differently—it's about seeing that what we call "problems" are often constructions built on questionable foundations. Examine the foundation, and the problem may cease to be a problem at all.

This connects to the critical voice work: the critical voice makes assumptions that go unexamined. "You should work out more" assumes that working out is something you "should" do, that the critical approach helps, that there's no alternative way to motivate yourself.

## How It Works

**Example: "I'm an asshole to my girlfriend"**

Hidden assumptions that must be true for this to be a problem:
1. The girlfriend doesn't want you to be an "asshole"
2. You actually know what being an "asshole" means (vs. what your mother defined it as)
3. There's some objective standard everyone agrees on (when really, 50% might call you an asshole and 50% might call you a hero)
4. The problem is *being* an asshole, rather than *resisting* being an asshole (causing it to come out sideways instead of clearly)

When Joe examined his own "asshole" behavior in venture capital, a friend challenged him to just accept it. As the shame fell away, he became less of an "asshole." The assumption that shame helps us improve is often inverted—shame holds bad habits in place.

**The shame-resistance pattern:**
- Is the problem that you smoke, or that you're ashamed of smoking?
- Is the problem that you're an asshole, or that you're ashamed of being an asshole?
- Shame often perpetuates the very behavior it claims to fix

## How to Apply It

1. **State the problem clearly** - "I am X" or "I have Y problem"

2. **List the assumptions** - What must be true for this to actually be a problem?
   - Definitions: What do these words actually mean?
   - Universality: Does everyone agree this is bad?
   - Causality: Is this the real cause, or is something else?
   - Necessity: Is the "solution" I'm assuming actually required?

3. **Question each assumption**
   - "Is that actually true?"
   - "Who defined it that way?"
   - "What if the opposite were true?"
   - "What if the problem is my resistance, not the behavior?"

4. **Notice what shifts** - Problems often fade, transform, or reveal their actual nature

5. **Find the real leverage point** - The actual issue is usually different from the stated problem

## When to Use It

- When you feel stuck on a problem that won't resolve
- When the critical voice is repeating the same critique
- When you've tried multiple solutions without success
- When shame or resistance seems to be part of the pattern
- When someone's stated problem doesn't match their behavior (coaching situations)
- When examining your own recurring issues
