# Main Quest vs Side Quest

> "Internally, we also talk about this, you know RPG games, you have the main quest lines and then you have the side quest lines. And we often talk about the companies avoid the side quests. There's always ideas people have and it's a good thing... but then it might be like, 'Yeah, let's make this T-shirt, so let's make this thing.' And then we're like, 'Well, does it help the customers? Does it help the product?' This sounds like a side quest to me, and basically means we shouldn't do it." - Karri Saarinen

## What It Is

Main Quest vs Side Quest is a prioritization framework borrowed from video game design. In role-playing games (RPGs), the main quest is the primary storyline that advances the core narrative, while side quests are optional activities that can be interesting but don't progress the central objective.

Applied to startups and product development, this framework provides a simple filter for evaluating whether activities and initiatives truly matter. The "main quest" is building your product and serving your customers. Everything else—no matter how appealing or seemingly valuable—is potentially a side quest that diverts resources from what matters most.

This approach helps teams stay focused, especially when presented with opportunities that seem valuable but don't directly contribute to core objectives.

## How It Works

The framework operates through a simple classification system:

**Main Quest Activities:**
- Building and improving the product
- Talking to customers
- Solving customer problems
- Activities that directly help customers or the product

**Side Quest Activities:**
- Tangential projects that don't serve customers
- "Nice to have" initiatives
- Activities that feel productive but don't advance core goals
- Things you could do later without consequence

**The Test:**
When evaluating any activity, ask:
1. Does this help our customers?
2. Does this help our product?
3. Does this progress our main quest line?

If the answer to all three is no, it's likely a side quest.

## How to Apply It

1. **Define your main quest clearly** - What is the primary objective your company is pursuing? For early-stage startups, this is typically: build the product, find product-market fit, serve customers.

2. **Evaluate opportunities through the lens** - When new ideas, requests, or opportunities arise, explicitly ask: "Is this main quest or side quest?"

3. **Be honest about distractions** - Some side quests feel important or urgent. Merchandise, conference sponsorships, elaborate processes—these can all feel valuable but may not advance your core mission.

4. **Use the language explicitly** - Make "main quest" and "side quest" part of your team's vocabulary. It provides a non-judgmental way to decline or deprioritize activities.

5. **Apply it personally** - As a leader, evaluate your own calendar: How much time are you spending on main quest vs side quest activities?

## When to Use It

**Best applied when:**
- Evaluating new initiatives or opportunities
- Feeling overwhelmed by competing priorities
- Teams are distracted by tangential projects
- Resources are limited (especially at startups)
- You need a quick filter for decision-making

**The YC version:**
Karri references Y Combinator's advice: "What you should be focusing on when you build a startup is talk to customers, build the product, exercise. If you find yourself doing something else than those three things, it's probably the wrong thing to do."

**Balance point:**
Some side quests may eventually become important (SOC 2 certification, for example). The framework doesn't mean never do side quests—it means be conscious about when you're choosing them over main quest activities.
