# Thinking in Bets

> "It's so incredibly necessary in improving decision quality to take what's implicit and make it explicit. It's not that intuition is crap, your intuition is sometimes right. If you don't make it explicit, then you don't get to find out when it's wrong." - Annie Duke

## What It Is

Thinking in Bets is a decision-making philosophy that treats every decision as a bet on an uncertain future. Rather than viewing decisions as right or wrong based on outcomes, it separates decision quality from outcome quality—recognizing that luck and hidden information always play a role.

The core insight is that your intuition is sometimes right and sometimes wrong, but you can only discover which is which by making your implicit assumptions explicit. When you keep your reasoning internal, you lose the ability to examine it, discuss it with others, or learn from your mistakes.

This approach was developed by Annie Duke from her experience as a professional poker player, where she had to make high-stakes decisions under uncertainty with incomplete information—conditions that mirror most business decisions.

## How It Works

The framework operates on several key principles:

**1. Resulting is the enemy**
"Resulting" is judging decision quality by outcome quality. A good decision can have a bad outcome (and vice versa) because of luck and incomplete information. Avoid conflating the two.

**2. Make the implicit explicit**
Whatever mental model you're using to make a decision—make it visible. Write down your assumptions, your forecasts, and your reasoning. This allows you to:
- Examine your own thinking for flaws
- Get input from others who might see blind spots
- Track your accuracy over time
- Learn and improve

**3. Calibrate your confidence**
Instead of binary "I know" or "I don't know," express beliefs in terms of probability. "I'm 70% confident this will work" is more useful than "I think this will work" because it acknowledges uncertainty and allows for better discussion.

**4. Use structured decision processes**
Create rubrics and frameworks that force explicit evaluation of factors you believe matter. At First Round Capital, Annie helped create structured evaluation forms where partners rate factors like market, founder, and product on scales—making their implicit judgments explicit and trackable.

## How to Apply It

1. **Before a decision**: Write down what you expect to happen and why. Include your confidence level (e.g., "70% confident this feature will increase retention by 10%").

2. **During discussions**: Instead of "I just know," explain the specific factors driving your intuition. What are you seeing that leads to this conclusion?

3. **Create decision rubrics**: For repeated decisions (hiring, investing, prioritization), build structured forms that capture the factors you believe matter. Rate them consistently.

4. **Track and review**: After outcomes are known, compare them to your predictions. Look for patterns—where is your intuition reliable? Where is it consistently off?

5. **Close feedback loops faster**: Don't wait for final outcomes. Identify intermediate signals that correlate with success and track those (see: [Shortening Feedback Loops](shortening-feedback-loops.md)).

## When to Use It

- **Hiring decisions**: Instead of "I know a good PM when I see one," define the specific attributes you're evaluating and rate candidates consistently
- **Investment decisions**: Create structured evaluation of market, team, product, traction—don't just rely on gut feel
- **Product prioritization**: Make explicit what factors drive priority and how you're weighting them
- **Strategic bets**: When committing significant resources to uncertain outcomes
- **Any decision with delayed feedback**: Where you won't know if you were right for months or years
