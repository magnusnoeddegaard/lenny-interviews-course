# Confidence Meter

> "People tend to just go with gut instinct and then give themselves a high confidence. They say it's an eight and I'm pretty convinced, so it's eight for confidence and I found this a bit disturbing because it kind of subverts the whole system." - Itamar Gilad

## What It Is

The Confidence Meter is a visual tool designed to help teams honestly assess how much evidence supports their ideas before making large investments. It addresses a common problem: when using frameworks like ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease), people often give themselves high confidence scores based purely on gut feeling, undermining the entire evidence-guided process.

The meter runs from 0 (guessing in the dark) to 10 (full certainty of success), with different types of evidence mapped across the spectrum. This makes it objective and consistent - you can't claim high confidence unless you've actually gathered strong evidence.

## How It Works

The meter is structured like a thermometer, progressing through increasingly rigorous forms of evidence:

**Very Low Confidence (0-0.1): Opinions**
- Self-conviction in the idea: 0.01
- A shiny pitch deck or detailed document: slightly higher but still near 0
- Thematic support ("it's about AI!"): still very low
- Behind every terrible idea, someone thought it was great

**Low Confidence (0.1-1): Reviews and Estimates**
- Colleague/stakeholder review: They can find flaws but have no crystal ball
- Group decisions: Sometimes worse than individual due to groupthink and politics
- Estimates and back-of-envelope calculations: Still guesswork, but slightly informed

**Low-Medium Confidence (1-3): Anecdotal Data**
- A few data points from your analytics
- A handful of customer conversations
- One competitor has this feature (never assume competitors know what they're doing)

**Medium Confidence (3-5): Market Data**
- Surveys with meaningful sample sizes
- Deep data analysis
- Comprehensive competitive analysis
- Multiple data sources contrasted against your idea

**Medium-High Confidence (5-7): Early Testing**
- Fake door tests, smoke tests, Wizard of Oz tests
- Usability testing with mockups/prototypes
- Concierge tests (manual delivery of the solution)

**High Confidence (7-9): Product Testing**
- Fish food (testing within your own team)
- Dog food (internal company testing)
- Previews, betas, labs with real users
- Longitudinal user studies

**Very High Confidence (9-10): Experiments and Results**
- A/B tests and multivariate tests with control groups
- Staged releases with clear metrics
- Percent launches with holdback groups

## How to Apply It

1. **Before investing heavily in an idea, locate it on the meter**: Be honest about what evidence you actually have. A gut feeling is 0.01, not 8.

2. **Match investment to confidence level**:
   - Low confidence? Do cheap validation first (surveys, mockups, competitor analysis)
   - Medium confidence? Build rough versions and test with users
   - High confidence? Move to experiments and staged rollout

3. **Use it to say no gently**: When stakeholders push ideas, reference the meter: "This idea is at 0.5 on the confidence meter. What would it take to get to 3?"

4. **Know when to stop**: Not every idea needs 10/10 confidence. Low-risk changes (reordering settings) don't need extensive validation. High-impact, high-cost ideas do.

5. **Let evidence change minds**: Share results at each stage. Even founders who proposed an idea will often reconsider when shown weak evidence.

## When to Use It

- **Prioritization discussions**: When teams debate which ideas to pursue
- **Stakeholder pushback**: When you need an objective way to challenge opinions from above
- **Investment decisions**: Before committing significant engineering time
- **Post-mortems**: To analyze why a project succeeded or failed - where was confidence at each stage?
- **Team alignment**: Creating shared language around how much you actually know vs. assume
