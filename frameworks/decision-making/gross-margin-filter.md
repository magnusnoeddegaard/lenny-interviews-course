# Gross Margin Filter

> "Start at a 60% gross margin. Why does that not work? And immediately, you short circuit to what the real problem is." - Jason Droege

## What It Is

The Gross Margin Filter is a coarse but powerful instrument for evaluating new business ideas. It uses gross margin as a proxy for two critical questions: Am I adding enough value? And am I differentiated enough to sustain that value?

When someone proposes a business with a 40% gross margin, the filter asks: why can't you charge enough to get to 60%? The answer to that question reveals the true competitive dynamics and value proposition of the business.

## How It Works

The filter operates through a series of escalating questions:

**The Core Question**: If you're selling something and can't mark it up a lot, how much value are you actually adding beyond what's in your hand?

**The Competitive Test**: When the answer to "why can't you charge more?" is "the customer has an alternative," immediately investigate:
- Who is the alternative?
- What's their gross margin?
- How long have they been operating at scale?

**The Trajectory Test**: If an offshore competitor is running at 20% gross margin with scaled operations, your 40% gross margin will compress to 20% faster than you think unless you differentiate.

## How to Apply It

1. **Start high, work down** - When someone pitches you a 40% gross margin business, ask why 60% doesn't work. The answer reveals the true competitive landscape.

2. **Trace margin compression** - If competitors with lower margins exist at scale, assume your margins will compress toward theirs over time.

3. **Look for defensibility signals** - High gross margins combined with healthy churn curves indicate real value creation and differentiation.

4. **Use it to disqualify quickly** - The filter isn't perfect, but it rapidly eliminates bad ideas and surfaces the real issues with marginal ones.

5. **Check the trajectory, not just the snapshot** - A 70% gross margin today means nothing if anyone else can do it tomorrow. Ask: why can't someone else do this in two years?

## When to Use It

- Evaluating new business ideas within an existing company
- Assessing startup pitches or investment opportunities
- Deciding which opportunities to pursue when resources are limited
- Stress-testing your own business model assumptions

## Exceptions to Consider

- **Scale-based businesses**: Costco and Walmart deliberately use low margins to absorb market demand and make it impossible for competitors to undercut them
- **Land-and-expand models**: Low margins on initial products can be acceptable if expansion revenue has high margins
- **Platform businesses**: Network effects can sustain value even at lower margins
