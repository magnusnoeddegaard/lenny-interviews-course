# Should/Can Divide

> "Some people are just locked into the can. They're uber pragmatic people, so it's like, 'Can we do this? Is it possible, given the debt, whatever constraints that you have?' And then there's people who for some reason go in and say, 'Should we do it? What should we do here? If those things were not an issue, what should we do?'" - John Cutler

## What It Is

The Should/Can Divide describes two fundamentally different orientations people bring to product decisions:

**Can-thinkers** focus on constraints and feasibility. They ask: "What is possible given our current technical debt, resources, timeline, and limitations?" They're grounded in reality and pragmatic about what's achievable.

**Should-thinkers** focus on aspiration and optimal outcomes. They ask: "What would be the right thing to do if constraints weren't blocking us?" They're oriented toward ideal solutions and systemic thinking.

Neither orientation is inherently better - both are necessary. But understanding this divide helps teams have more productive conversations and avoid talking past each other.

## How It Works

**Can-Oriented Thinking:**
- Starts with constraints
- Asks: "Is this feasible?"
- Focuses on: technical debt, resources, timeline, dependencies
- Strength: Realistic, grounded, practical
- Risk: May accept suboptimal solutions too readily

**Should-Oriented Thinking:**
- Starts with ideal outcomes
- Asks: "What's the right thing to do?"
- Focuses on: customer value, long-term strategy, optimal design
- Strength: Ambitious, customer-centered, strategic
- Risk: May ignore real constraints and frustrate teams

**The Productive Tension:**
The best decisions come from combining both perspectives:
1. Start with "should" to understand the ideal
2. Apply "can" to understand constraints
3. Find creative solutions that maximize "should" within "can"

## How to Apply It

1. **Recognize your default orientation** - Most people lean toward one mode. Understanding your tendency helps you compensate.

2. **Explicitly sequence the conversation** - Start meetings with "What should we do?" before moving to "What can we do?" This prevents premature constraint acceptance.

3. **Separate the two discussions** - Don't let feasibility concerns shut down aspiration discussions too early. Let both perspectives be fully heard.

4. **Challenge "can't" statements** - When someone says "We can't do X," ask: "If we could, would we want to?" This reveals whether the constraint is the real blocker or a convenient excuse.

5. **Value both orientations** - Build teams with both types of thinkers. The friction between them, when managed well, produces better decisions.

6. **Teach "should" thinking as a skill** - Cutler notes this isn't just personality - it involves systems thinking, decoupling tactics from strategy, and questioning assumptions.

## When to Use It

- During product planning and prioritization
- When teams are stuck in endless feasibility debates
- When evaluating whether constraints are real or assumed
- When building diverse product teams
- When coaching product managers on strategic thinking
