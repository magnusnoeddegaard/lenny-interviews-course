# Isn't That Interesting (Optimistic Stance)

> "One of my favorites is, 'Isn't that interesting?' And I have it as a sticky note, a physical sticky note on my computer monitor to remind me... It's a kind of radical appreciation. Not isn't this good or bad, but wow, I just stubbed my toe and it really hurts. Isn't that interesting? Let me feel that throbbing toe." - Donna Lichaw

## What It Is

"Isn't That Interesting" is a mindfulness-based decision-making approach that replaces immediate judgment with curious observation. Rather than reacting to situations as good or bad, you adopt what Gestalt psychology calls an "optimistic stance"—a state of radical appreciation for whatever is happening, regardless of whether you like it.

This isn't toxic positivity or denial. It's not saying "everything is great" when it isn't. Instead, it's suspending the judgment layer entirely: "Isn't that interesting that my shoulders are tensing up right now" is different from both "This is terrible" and "This is fine." It's simply noticing what is, which creates space for more informed action.

The framework comes from Donna's coaching mentors and integrates Buddhist principles of non-judgmental awareness with practical leadership application. The key insight is that judgment—whether positive or negative—narrows our perception and constrains our options. Curiosity expands both.

## How It Works

**The Standard Reactive Pattern**

Most people respond to challenging situations through an automatic sequence:

1. **Event occurs** (someone talks over you in a meeting)
2. **Immediate judgment** ("That's rude/disrespectful/unacceptable")
3. **Emotional reaction** (anger, frustration, withdrawal)
4. **Automatic behavior** (bark back, get quiet, stew internally)

This pattern is fast but often counterproductive—the automatic response may not serve your actual goals.

**The "Isn't That Interesting" Pattern**

The framework inserts curiosity between event and response:

1. **Event occurs** (someone talks over you in a meeting)
2. **Curiosity prompt** ("Isn't that interesting")
3. **Full observation** (notice thoughts, feelings, body sensations)
4. **Informed choice** (decide how to respond based on complete data)

**What to Observe**

When you say "Isn't that interesting," direct your attention to:
- **External facts** - What actually just happened?
- **Internal thoughts** - What stories am I telling myself?
- **Emotions** - What am I feeling?
- **Body sensations** - Where am I holding tension? What's my physical state?

This expands the data available for your response decision.

## How to Apply It

1. **Create a physical reminder** - Put "Isn't that interesting?" on a sticky note where you'll see it. The prompt needs to be visible when you're in reactive mode.

2. **Practice on small things first** - Start with minor irritations (stubbing your toe, hitting traffic) rather than major conflicts. Build the habit in low-stakes moments.

3. **Say it internally or externally** - When something challenging happens, pause and ask yourself "Isn't that interesting?" The phrase itself creates the needed gap between stimulus and response.

4. **Observe without fixing** - Resist the urge to immediately solve or judge. Just notice: "Isn't that interesting that my shoulders are really tense right now." Don't try to relax them yet—just notice.

5. **Let insights emerge** - With practice, this pause allows patterns to surface: "I notice I always tense up when this person speaks." These insights inform better responses over time.

6. **Take mindful action** - After observing, you can still respond—but now with fuller information. Often the pause changes what response seems appropriate.

## When to Use It

- When someone says or does something triggering
- When you notice yourself having a strong emotional reaction
- When you're about to make a reactive decision you might regret
- When you feel confused or overwhelmed by a situation
- During difficult conversations or negotiations
- Anytime you want to respond rather than react
