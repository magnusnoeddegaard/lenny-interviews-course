# Attachment and Suffering (Four Noble Truths)

> "When we become attached to the outcome, we inadvertently fuel our own suffering. When we become attached... the deeper attachment is 'see, I'm not nothing. See, I'm not a nobody, I'm a somebody'—and that's the source of the suffering." - Jerry Colonna

## What It Is

Jerry Colonna applies Buddhist wisdom—specifically the Four Noble Truths—to leadership and career challenges. The core insight is that our attempts to push away suffering through acquisition, achievement, or busyness often increase rather than decrease our suffering.

**The Four Noble Truths (as Jerry presents them):**
1. Life is filled with suffering
2. That which we do to push away suffering increases suffering
3. There is an end to suffering
4. The eightfold path provides a way to end suffering

The second noble truth is particularly relevant for leaders: when we acquire nice things, chase growth, or stay constantly busy to avoid feeling inadequate, we create new sources of anxiety (what if I lose this?) that fuel more suffering.

## How It Works

**The Attachment Trap:**

1. We feel anxiety about our worth or safety
2. We acquire something (success, money, status, possessions) to feel better
3. This creates temporary relief
4. Now we're attached to that thing—terrified of losing it
5. The attachment creates new anxiety
6. We acquire more to manage the new anxiety
7. The cycle continues, each loop adding more burden

**The Self-Worth Connection:**

The deepest attachment isn't to things—it's to using those things to prove our worth:
- "If I'm successful, I'm somebody"
- "If I'm busy, I matter"
- "If I have this house/income/title, I'm safe"

When success becomes proof of worthiness, we can never have enough. The voice that says "you're not good enough" is never satisfied by achievement—it just raises the bar.

**Example from the episode:**

Lenny describes enjoying his newsletter's growth ("I feel great") but feeling anxious when growth stalls ("maybe it's all going to fall apart, maybe I'm not as good at this as I thought").

Jerry identifies this as classic attachment: "By being busy and by being on that growth trajectory, that voice [the imposter voice] maybe sounds a little less persistent. What if you could enjoy the puzzle of creating something new... but it doesn't matter to your sense of self-esteem if you succeed or fail?"

## How to Apply It

1. **Examine the "why" behind acquisitions**
   - Are you buying that house/taking that job/pursuing that goal to enjoy it, or to push away feelings of inadequacy?
   - "If we're doing it to enjoy the couch or the house, then A-OK. But if we're doing it because we're trying to push away the suffering of 'am I good enough'... that which we do to push away suffering will increase suffering."

2. **Separate worth from outcomes**
   - Your value as a human is unshakable—independent of success or failure
   - Ask: Would the people who love me stop loving me if this failed?
   - "The people who actually know you and care about you may be proud of your efforts, but their love for you is not dependent upon its success."

3. **Hold goals loosely**
   - Pursue goals because the puzzle is fun, the work is meaningful, or the craft is satisfying
   - Let go of needing the outcome to validate your existence
   - "What if what drove you was not quieting that voice, but what drove you was, oh, this is just fun?"

4. **Notice growth mindset becoming fixed mindset**
   - A growth mindset is helpful—until you become attached to always having one
   - "The minute you start to nail it down and say 'this is the way it ought to be,' you've become fixed"
   - Hold even useful mindsets loosely

5. **Recognize the third noble truth: there IS an end**
   - This isn't about giving up ambition
   - It's about finding sustainable motivation that doesn't require external validation
   - "Stay attached to the growth and hold mindset a little loosely"

## When to Use It

- When success feels hollow or anxiety-producing
- When you can't enjoy achievements because you're already worried about the next one
- When busyness feels compulsive rather than chosen
- When the fear of losing what you have dominates your thinking
- When making decisions driven by "what will people think?"
- During periods of introspection about meaning and purpose
