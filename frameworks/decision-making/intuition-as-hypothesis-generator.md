# Intuition as Hypothesis Generator

> "I think intuition is like a hypothesis generator and you're constantly generating these hypotheses and others are generating hypotheses as well. And you then take these hypotheses and you put them forward and you debate them and you try to find data to support them or negate them. And then you winnow it down into what is our working hypothesis? And from that you move forward." - Dylan Field

## What It Is

Intuition isn't mystical gut instinct that should be trusted blindly—it's a rapid pattern-matching system that generates hypotheses for further examination. The key insight is treating intuition as the starting point of a process, not the endpoint.

When Rick Rubin says he has "confidence in my taste and my ability to express what I feel," he's describing the same dynamic. Great product taste isn't about always being right—it's about generating promising hypotheses faster and more reliably than others.

Dylan Field applies this at Figma by constantly generating hypotheses about what users need, then testing them through conversation, data, and debate before committing to solutions.

## How It Works

1. **Hypothesis generation**: Your intuition rapidly produces potential answers, directions, or solutions based on accumulated experience and pattern recognition

2. **Externalization**: The hypotheses must be made explicit and shared with others—they can't stay locked in your head

3. **Debate and investigation**: The team challenges hypotheses, asks questions, and seeks data that supports or negates them

4. **Winnowing**: Through this process, you narrow down to a working hypothesis that has survived scrutiny

5. **Forward motion**: Commit to the working hypothesis while remaining open to new information

## How to Apply It

1. **Make your intuitions explicit** - When you have a strong feeling about a product direction, articulate it as a hypothesis: "I think users want X because Y"

2. **Invite challenge** - Share hypotheses with people who will ask hard questions. Dylan asks follow-up questions to fully understand proposals: "Let's go find the answer to these questions and then come back to this conversation"

3. **Gather supporting/negating evidence** - Look for concrete data, user feedback, and examples that test your hypothesis

4. **Debate with artifacts** - "The more concrete an artifact is or the more you can debate something, the better." Build prototypes or examples to make debates productive

5. **Trust the process over individual calls** - Your intuition will be wrong sometimes. The value is in generating good hypotheses consistently, not in being right every time

## When to Use It

- When making product decisions where data is incomplete
- When you have strong feelings about a direction but can't fully articulate why
- When building product sense in yourself or your team
- When resolving debates about product direction
- When someone has a strong conviction you're skeptical of
