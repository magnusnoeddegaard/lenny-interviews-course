# Single Issue Voter Trap

> "If you're a great engineer, the answer to almost every problem in your business is engineering. If you're a product designer, the answer almost to the proverbial redesign... If you think the thing that you've been doing your whole career is the way to fix your problem, it's at least 30% likely that you've chosen that because of comfort and familiarity not truth." - Bret Taylor

## What It Is

A cognitive bias pattern where founders and leaders subconsciously interpret all business problems through the lens of their strongest skill or background, proposing solutions that match their expertise rather than what the situation actually requires.

The term comes from politics—a "single issue voter" votes based on one issue regardless of everything else. Similarly, a single-issue-voter founder sees every challenge through one lens:

- **Engineers** see everything as an engineering problem
- **Designers** believe the next redesign will fix everything
- **BD people** think the right partnership will change everything
- **Sales people** see pricing or positioning issues everywhere

This isn't malicious—it's an unconscious pattern that emerges because people naturally gravitate toward familiar tools and comfortable solutions.

## How It Works

The trap operates through several mechanisms:

**1. Familiarity bias**
You know engineering deeply, so engineering problems are the ones you see clearly. You have mental frameworks for solving them. Other problems seem murky by comparison.

**2. Competence comfort**
Proposing solutions in your wheelhouse feels good—you know you can execute them. Proposing solutions outside your expertise feels risky and uncertain.

**3. Pattern matching**
Your past successes came from applying your core skill. You naturally pattern-match new problems to old solutions.

**4. Team dynamics**
First-time founders often build teams that reflect their own skills (11 of 12 FriendFeed employees were engineers), creating an echo chamber that reinforces the bias.

## How to Apply It

**Detect the trap:**

1. When you diagnose a problem, notice if your proposed solution uses your primary skill
2. Ask: "If I wasn't a [engineer/designer/salesperson], would I still propose this solution?"
3. Consider: There's at least a 30% chance you're choosing comfort over truth

**Break the trap:**

1. **Diverse founding teams** - Partner with people who have different superpowers
2. **Cross-functional dialogue** - Have "very real conversations" with engineering partners, marketing partners, etc.
3. **Question your diagnosis** - When you lose a deal or fail to convert users, dig past the obvious explanation
4. **Seek outside advisors** - Find people who will tell you what you need to hear, not want to hear
5. **Study the why** - Ask "why?" like a two-year-old until you understand the framework behind advice, not just the recommendation

**Validate differently:**

Don't just ask "Is my proposed solution good?" Ask "What solutions have I not considered because they're outside my expertise?"

## The FriendFeed Example

Bret Taylor's FriendFeed team had 11 engineers out of 12 employees. When Twitter attracted Obama, Ashton Kutcher, and Oprah, FriendFeed kept polishing the product while Twitter focused on distribution. FriendFeed's product was more innovative, had more features, and had better uptime—but they lost for reasons unrelated to product.

The team couldn't see that distribution and celebrity partnerships were the lever because no one on the team thought that way. They were "somewhat myopic... in our own little world, creating this product."
