# Assume You Don't Know

> "Our second value is assume you don't know. And the value 'assume you don't know' is, even if you're a subject matter expert... The follow up to that value is, 'So we got to get going.' It's like dropping in a new city. You just got to walk out the door of your Airbnb, turn left and... Maybe you'll turn right and then you'll hop on the subway, but you just got to get going and see what you find." - Josh Miller

## What It Is

Assume You Don't Know is a decision-making and cultural principle that combines intellectual humility with a bias toward action. Even experts should approach problems as if they don't know the answer, which paradoxically accelerates learning and leads to better outcomes.

This isn't about lacking confidence or pretending you have no expertise. It's about recognizing that even deep experience doesn't guarantee you know how something will work in a new context. The Browser Company has team members who literally built Chrome, yet those same people embody the most beginner's-mind approach to building their new browser.

The critical follow-up is action: because you don't know, you have to try things, prototype, and learn from reality. The opposite—analysis paralysis driven by trying to figure everything out in advance—is the enemy.

## How It Works

The framework has two connected parts:

1. **Beginner's Mind**: Approach each problem as if you've never solved it before. Don't assume past solutions will work. Don't let expertise blind you to new possibilities.

2. **Bias to Action**: Because you can't know the answer through thinking alone, you must act to learn. Start moving, try things, see what happens.

The metaphor is powerful: when you arrive in a new city, you can't understand it by looking at a map. You have to walk out the door, turn left or right, and start exploring. The same applies to product development, business decisions, and organizational challenges.

## How to Apply It

1. **Catch yourself being an expert**: When you find yourself saying "I know how this works" or "We've done this before," pause. Ask: What might be different this time?

2. **Convert opinions into hypotheses**: Instead of "We should do X," frame it as "We think X might work—let's test it."

3. **Create small experiments**: Design quick, low-cost ways to test your assumptions rather than debating them.

4. **Embrace prototyping**: Build rough versions early. Let reality teach you what works.

5. **Pair with "What Could Be" thinking**: Use beginner's mind to free yourself from constraints, then ask what the most ambitious possible outcome could be.

6. **Model the behavior at the top**: If leaders demonstrate beginner's mind, it gives everyone permission to not have all the answers.

## When to Use It

- When entering new markets or building new product categories
- When past approaches have stopped working
- When team discussions get stuck in expertise-based debates
- When facing genuinely novel problems (AI, new platforms, paradigm shifts)
- When hiring experts from successful companies—help them shed assumptions
