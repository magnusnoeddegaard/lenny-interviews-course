# Three Divergent Directions

> "I really truly believe in the power of three. I actually ask my teams to write three press releases, alternative and divergent." - Anuj Rathi

## What It Is

Three Divergent Directions is a decision-making practice that requires teams to develop three meaningfully different approaches before choosing one. Not variations on a theme, but genuinely divergent options that explore different strategic paths.

This framework enhances the Working Backwards process (PR FAQs) by preventing premature convergence on a single solution. It creates better decisions through more thorough exploration and builds stronger organizational alignment by showing stakeholders that their input was genuinely considered.

## How It Works

### The Power of Three

When presenting only one option, two problems emerge:

1. **Stakeholders feel unheard**: During discovery, you gathered input from many people. If you only show one roadmap, anyone whose suggestion didn't make the cut feels dismissed—even if their idea was seriously considered.

2. **Leadership can't evaluate**: Without alternatives, executives can't understand trade-offs. They're forced to either accept your recommendation blindly or micromanage the details.

### What "Divergent" Means

Options should differ on fundamental dimensions, not surface features:
- Different target segments
- Different pricing strategies
- Different technical approaches
- Different timeline/scope trade-offs
- Different risk profiles

**Good Example** (membership program):
1. Two-tier membership with premium benefits
2. Three-tier membership with loyalty points
3. Dynamic pricing without membership

**Bad Example**:
1. Blue membership with $9.99/month
2. Blue membership with $10.99/month
3. Blue membership with annual billing

### The Recommendation Element

Having three options doesn't mean abdication:
- You must recommend one option
- Explain why it's best given company strategy, market conditions, and capabilities
- The other two show your work and create context for your recommendation
- Leadership can combine elements or disagree with full context

## How to Apply It

1. **Develop three complete PR FAQs**
   - Each should be fully thought through
   - Not strawmen—each should be viable
   - Include customer quotes, business manager quotes, FAQs for each

2. **Make options address different stakeholder concerns**
   - Option A might prioritize the engineering concern
   - Option B might prioritize the business concern
   - Option C might prioritize the customer concern

3. **Use it to build alliances and surface blockers**
   - Show marketing: "Which of these can you support?"
   - Show engineering: "Which is feasible by this date?"
   - Show business owners: "Which aligns with your goals?"

4. **Present with clear recommendation**
   - "Here are three approaches. I recommend Option B because..."
   - "Option A addresses X concern but creates Y problem"
   - "Option C was rejected because Z"

5. **Enable "disagree and commit"**
   - Once a direction is chosen, everyone commits
   - The exploration process builds legitimacy for the final decision

## When to Use It

- Strategic planning and roadmap decisions
- Product launches and go-to-market planning
- Any PR FAQ / Working Backwards exercise
- When presenting to CXOs or leadership
- When you anticipate pushback or competing perspectives
- Any decision that will require cross-team commitment
