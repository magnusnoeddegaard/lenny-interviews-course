# Evidence-Guided Development

> "Evidence guided companies put a high premium on focusing on customers, coming up with a lot of ideas on looking at the data, looking at how these ideas actually worked out... they expected people to take action based on the results." - Itamar Gilad

## What It Is

Evidence-Guided Development is a philosophy and set of practices that balances human judgment with evidence, rather than relying purely on opinions (no matter how senior) or purely on data (which can miss qualitative insights). It sits between two failure modes:

**Opinion-Based Development**: An idea emerges, seems good, early signs look promising, so the organization goes all-in without rigorous validation. This led to Google+ - a 1000-person project that was shut down after years of work because "we believed in it" wasn't enough.

**Over-Reliance on Data**: Waiting for perfect data before every decision, analysis paralysis, or letting metrics override clear qualitative signals.

Evidence-Guided Development finds the middle path: strong hypotheses informed by human insight, but validated through progressively rigorous evidence before major investments.

## How It Works

**The Anti-Pattern: Opinion-Based Development**
Telltale signs your organization is opinion-based:
- Goals are unclear, vague, or output-focused
- Metrics are missing or only business metrics (no user-facing metrics)
- Lots of time spent on roadmapping and planning
- Little experimentation, or experimentation without learning
- Disengaged development teams focused purely on delivery

**The Evidence-Guided Alternative**
Key principles from companies like early Google, Amazon, and Airbnb:
1. **Customer focus**: Continuously learn from users, not just at the start
2. **Many ideas**: Generate lots of hypotheses, don't commit to one early
3. **Look at the data**: Measure what's actually happening, not what you expect
4. **Expect action on results**: Fail fast - kill or pivot projects that aren't working
5. **Balance judgment and evidence**: Leaders still propose ideas, but they're tested

**The Gmail Tabbed Inbox Example**
The tabbed inbox (Promotions, Social, Primary tabs) was built evidence-guided:
- Started as a small idea nobody believed in
- Team researched the actual user problem (85% of users were "passive" and living in clutter)
- Generated multiple ideas, not just one
- Used Wizard of Oz testing (manually sorted emails behind the scenes while users watched)
- Built progressively: internal dog food → external testers → usability studies → data mining
- Launched only after strong evidence - now used by 1.8 billion users

## How to Apply It

1. **Diagnose where you are**: Use the telltale signs above. Are goals unclear? Too much roadmapping? Disengaged teams?

2. **Challenge opinions with "Where's your evidence?"**: Make this a normal part of discussions, even for senior leaders' ideas. Not hostile - curious.

3. **Run experiments before committing**: When someone proposes an idea, ask: "What's the cheapest way we could test this before building it fully?"

4. **Share evidence, not just opinions**: When presenting ideas, show the confidence meter level. "This is at 0.5 - we have a pitch deck. Here's what we'd need to get to 3."

5. **Embrace early failure**: The goal isn't to never fail - it's to fail fast and cheap. Google's fail fast culture would have caught Google+ problems earlier.

6. **Don't abandon human judgment**: Evidence-guided isn't data-only. Steve Jobs still made bold calls - but he changed his mind when shown strong evidence (multitouch, the phone itself). The myth of pure visionary genius hides the discovery process behind great products.

## When to Use It

- **High-uncertainty environments**: Startups, new products, entering new markets
- **Organizations that regressed**: Companies that used to be evidence-guided but lost the culture
- **Teams emerging into modern product development**: Adopting Agile, OKRs, experimentation but struggling to connect the pieces
- **Cultures dominated by HiPPOs**: Where highest-paid-person's-opinion always wins
- **Post-failure retrospectives**: Understanding why a project failed (was it opinion-based?)
