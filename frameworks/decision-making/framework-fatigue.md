# Framework Fatigue

> "Every framework at its limit is followed to such a religious extent it's just unhelpful. You need to have nuance in how you leverage these frameworks. Otherwise, you lose the forest through the trees and you end up following a process for the sake of following a process." - Kayvon Beykpour

## What It Is

Framework Fatigue is the phenomenon where an organization over-applies a framework to the point where it causes poor decisions. The framework—whether Jobs-to-Be-Done, OKRs, or any other methodology—stops being a lens for insight and becomes dogma that overrides judgment.

The irony: frameworks are designed to improve decision-making, but when followed religiously, they do the opposite. Teams optimize for "following the framework correctly" rather than "making the right decision." The map replaces the territory.

Kayvon experienced this at Twitter with Jobs-to-Be-Done, which was implemented so strictly that it became "exhausting and not particularly helpful." But the problem isn't unique to JTBD—it happens with any framework that becomes the sole governing principle for what to build.

## How It Works

**The Degeneration Path**:
1. Framework is introduced to solve a real problem
2. Framework produces early wins, building confidence
3. Organization mandates framework application broadly
4. Framework becomes checklist—process replaces thinking
5. Edge cases multiply where framework produces wrong answer
6. Following framework becomes career-safe; deviating becomes risky
7. Bad decisions accumulate, justified by "we followed the framework"

**The OKR Trap at Twitter**:
Twitter was hyper-focused on DAU (Daily Active Users). Features that hurt DAU in the short term—even if beneficial long-term—got killed. "The team would just be blind towards leaving hostile customer experiences in place because it was good for metrics in aggregate."

Example: Twitter would automatically switch users from reverse-chronological to ranked timeline even when users explicitly chose reverse-chron. Why? Because ranked timeline drove better DAU metrics, even though users hated having their choice overridden.

**The JTBD Trap at Twitter**:
Jobs-to-Be-Done was intended to force customer-centric thinking, but became so process-heavy that teams spent more time on framework compliance than on actual customer insight.

## How to Apply It

### Detecting Framework Fatigue

1. **Bad subjective decisions** - Are you seeing decisions that feel obviously wrong to someone with good product taste, but get justified by the framework?

2. **Blocked bold bets** - Is the framework preventing you from taking speculative bets that don't fit neatly into its structure?

3. **Customer hostility** - Are you shipping things that are "good for metrics" but that customers hate?

4. **Process theater** - Are teams spending more time demonstrating framework compliance than doing the actual work?

5. **Loss of nuance** - Have trade-off discussions disappeared, replaced by "the framework says X"?

### Breaking Free

1. **Name the problem** - Call out that the framework is being over-applied. Make it safe to discuss.

2. **Reintroduce judgment** - Remind teams that frameworks are tools, not laws. "Sometimes it's just good old-fashioned judgment and product taste."

3. **Create escape valves** - Some projects (like Twitter's Community Notes/Birdwatch) were explicitly structured outside normal framework constraints: "Don't worry about the OKRs. We're not going to judge you on the basis of your OKRs."

4. **Balance with alternative lenses** - If OKRs dominate, add qualitative customer feedback. If JTBD dominates, add competitive analysis. No single lens should rule.

5. **Leadership permission** - Leaders must model framework flexibility and protect teams that deviate with good judgment.

## When to Use It

- When teams report feeling constrained by process
- When you see clearly bad decisions being defended by framework logic
- When speculative projects keep getting killed for not fitting the model
- When customer complaints are dismissed because "metrics are fine"
- When new hires with fresh eyes express confusion at decisions
