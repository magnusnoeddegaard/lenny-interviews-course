# RAPID Decision-Making

> "Making sure that you have a single person's name on the decision line... that usually makes sure you can get a decision very quickly." - Hari Srinivasan

## What It Is

RAPID is a decision-making framework used at LinkedIn to clarify roles and accelerate decision-making in complex organizational ecosystems. The acronym defines who plays what role in any given decision:

- **R** - Recommender: The person who proposes the decision
- **A** - Agree: People who must formally agree (often due to policy, legal, or cross-functional impact)
- **P** - Performer: People who will execute once the decision is made
- **I** - Input: People who provide information and perspective but don't have decision rights
- **D** - Decision-maker: The single person who makes the final call

The framework originated from Bain & Company and has been adopted widely in tech organizations. LinkedIn uses it to navigate decisions across their interconnected marketplace ecosystems—where the feed, hiring products, learning products, and premium services all interact.

## How It Works

The key principle is having **one single decision-maker** clearly identified. When running multiple marketplaces within one ecosystem (like LinkedIn does with talent, learning, and engagement), many decisions create ties or conflicts between teams. RAPID eliminates ambiguity by making clear who ultimately owns the call.

Hari combines RAPID with a personal rule: "If you had three back and forths in an email, you got to pick up the phone. And if you've been on the phone for 20 minutes, it's time to just write that decision-maker and go." This creates a forcing function where decisions should happen within an hour, not days.

## How to Apply It

1. **Define the decision** - Be specific about what exactly needs to be decided
2. **Identify stakeholders** - List everyone who has a stake in the outcome
3. **Assign RAPID roles** - Put exactly one name on each role (the D is critical)
4. **Set decision timeline** - Establish when the decision needs to be made
5. **Gather input efficiently** - Collect perspectives from I's without endless debate
6. **Make the call** - The D decides, even with imperfect information
7. **Communicate and execute** - Share the decision and let P's execute

## When to Use It

- Cross-functional decisions that affect multiple teams or products
- Decisions in complex ecosystems where many stakeholders have opinions
- When decisions are stalling due to unclear ownership
- Anytime you notice decision paralysis or "too many cooks" situations
- Strategic choices that require trade-offs between different parts of the business
