# What is the Most Impactful Thing Today?

> "Waking up every morning, what is the most impactful thing I could do today?" - Bret Taylor

## What It Is

A daily discipline for prioritizing work based on impact rather than comfort, preference, or identity. Instead of conforming your job to the things you like to do, you ask what the role actually needs from you today to maximize success.

This framework came from a formative moment in Bret Taylor's career when Sheryl Sandberg gave him direct feedback about how he was managing his newly expanded team at Facebook. He realized he was subconsciously limiting his success by trying to conform the job to his interests (product and engineering) instead of asking what his platform and mobile teams actually needed to succeed.

The key insight: what you enjoy doing and what creates the most impact are not always the same thing—but when you optimize for impact, you often discover you enjoy more things than you thought.

## How It Works

The framework operates on three principles:

**1. Detach from role identity**
Don't think of yourself as "an engineer" or "a product person" or "a salesperson." Think of yourself as someone trying to achieve an outcome. The work that matters might be recruiting, selling, designing, coding, or managing—whatever moves the needle.

**2. Ask the question honestly**
Imagine you had an external board of advisors telling you what to focus on to maximize the likelihood of achieving your goals. What would they say? Sometimes it's the uncomfortable work you've been avoiding.

**3. Discover joy in impact**
When you reframe work around impact, you often find that activities you thought you didn't like become enjoyable because you can see them creating results. The act of engineering or product design isn't what you love—it's the impact that creates joy.

## How to Apply It

1. **Morning reset** - Each day, literally or figuratively ask: "What is the most impactful thing I could do today?"

2. **Challenge your instincts** - If the answer is something in your wheelhouse (your strongest skill), question it. There's at least a 30% chance you chose it out of comfort, not truth.

3. **Seek diverse input** - Get perspectives from co-founders, cross-functional partners, or advisors who see your blind spots. Have "very real conversations" to ensure you're working on the actual correct thing.

4. **Watch for self-deception** - Be aware of "incorrect storytelling"—convincing yourself and your team of explanations that feel comfortable but aren't accurate.

## When to Use It

- When taking on a new role or expanding responsibilities
- When you feel stuck or ineffective despite working hard
- When you notice yourself gravitating toward familiar tasks
- When making daily prioritization decisions
- When your current approach isn't producing results

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **Single issue voting**: If you're an engineer, not every problem is an engineering problem. If you're a designer, the next redesign won't magically fix everything. If you're a BD person, partnerships aren't always the answer.

- **Comfort optimization**: Spending time on what you like vs. what creates results

- **Incorrect storytelling**: Accepting surface explanations (like "the price was too high") without digging for root causes (like "they didn't see the value")
