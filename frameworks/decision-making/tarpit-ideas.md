# Tarpit Ideas

> "By definition it is only a tarpit if it seems like it's not. If it's just a regular idea that is hard, that is not a tarpit. The weird aspect of what we call a tarpit idea is an idea that a lot of people come up with and then it seems like an unsolved problem and you get lots of positive feedback for." - Dalton Caldwell

## What It Is

A tarpit idea is a startup concept that appears promising, attracts many founders, generates positive validation signals, and yet consistently fails to become a successful business. Unlike obviously bad ideas that founders quickly abandon, tarpit ideas are uniquely dangerous because they feel like they should work.

The term comes from the La Brea Tar Pits—animals would walk into what appeared to be normal ground, get stuck, and be unable to escape. Similarly, founders walk into these ideas thinking they're on solid ground, only to find themselves trapped.

What makes an idea a true tarpit is the combination of: (1) many people independently arrive at the same idea, (2) it seems like an unsolved problem, (3) you can get genuine positive validation from potential customers, and (4) people have been trying (and failing) to make it work for decades.

## How It Works

Tarpit ideas share several dangerous characteristics:

**High Validation, Low Conversion**
- Friends and potential users genuinely say they want the product
- Early testing shows interest and engagement
- But users don't actually change behavior or pay money
- The gap between stated interest and action is enormous

**Convergent Thinking**
- When founders consume the same information (same podcasts, same Twitter follows, same blog posts), they arrive at the same ideas
- Tarpit ideas feel novel to each founder but are actually obvious to everyone with the same inputs
- The "information diet" of the startup ecosystem creates predictable idea generation

**Historic Failure Patterns**
- These ideas have been attempted repeatedly since the 1990s
- Each generation of founders thinks they'll be the ones to crack it
- The fundamental barriers (user behavior, business model, market dynamics) haven't changed

## Classic Examples

**Friend Coordination Apps**
- Apps to decide where to go out at night or coordinate meetups
- Your friends say "I would love that!"
- Nobody actually uses them because coordination happens through existing tools
- This has been tried continuously for 25+ years

**Music Discovery Services**
- Seems like everyone wants better music recommendations
- Users engage with discovery features
- Monetization never works; the industry structure prevents it

**Foursquare Clones**
- Location check-in apps seemed inevitable in the early 2010s
- Generated significant user interest
- The behavior never stuck; Foursquare itself pivoted to B2B

## How to Detect Tarpit Ideas

1. **Research the history**: Has this idea been tried before? What happened?
2. **Question the validation**: Are people saying they want this, or actually paying/using it?
3. **Check the competitive landscape**: Are many founders working on similar things right now?
4. **Examine the information diet**: Did you arrive at this idea through unique insight, or common knowledge?
5. **Ask why now**: What has changed that would make this work now when it didn't before?

## How to Escape

If you're already in a tarpit:

1. **Acknowledge reality**: The validation you're getting doesn't predict success
2. **Pivot toward expertise**: Use what you've learned to move to adjacent, more viable spaces
3. **Look for genuine insights**: What did you learn that nobody else knows?
4. **Move off the beaten path**: Find ideas from personal experience or deep domain expertise

## When to Consider It

Use this framework when:
- Evaluating a new startup idea
- Wondering why you can't grow despite positive user feedback
- Deciding whether to pivot or persist
- Assessing whether your idea is truly differentiated
