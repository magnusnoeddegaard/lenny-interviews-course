# Negative Visualization (Business)

> "The idea of negative visualization. What's the worst that can happen? You got to be at peace with the worst that can happen. Just role-play that and go, 'What's the worst?' This could be a total flop. What's the worst that can happen? Well, we spent six months exploring something and having a really good time doing it." - Jason Fried

## What It Is

Negative Visualization is a Stoic practice adapted for business decisions: deliberately imagining the worst possible outcome before committing to a course of action. The goal isn't to become pessimistic but to make peace with failure before starting, which paradoxically frees you to take more risks.

When you've already accepted that something might fail completely, you're no longer paralyzed by that fear. You can move forward with clarity because you know you'll be okay even in the worst case. This is fundamentally different from optimism, which assumes things will work out, or from ignoring risk altogether.

The practice comes from Stoic philosophy (particularly Seneca and Marcus Aurelius), where it's called "premeditatio malorum"—the premeditation of evils. In business, it's a practical tool for making decisions under uncertainty.

## How It Works

**The Process**:
1. Before starting something new, stop and ask: "What's the worst that can happen?"
2. Actually answer the question honestly and specifically
3. Consider whether you could survive and recover from that outcome
4. If yes, you've achieved peace with the risk
5. If no, reconsider whether the upside justifies the downside

**What "Peace" Means**:
- Not that you want the bad outcome
- Not that you think it will happen
- But that you've accepted it could happen
- And you've decided you're okay with that possibility
- So you can proceed without fear driving your decisions

**Example (Jason Fried on ONCE)**:
- Best case: A new product line that creates a business shift
- Worst case: A total flop, six months "wasted"
- Reality check: Those six months were spent doing work we enjoyed
- Conclusion: Even the worst case is acceptable, so proceed

## How to Apply It

1. **Make it explicit**: Before major decisions, write down "The worst that can happen is..."

2. **Be specific**: "It fails" is too vague. Get concrete: "We spend six months and $100K and get zero customers."

3. **Assess survivability**: Could you recover from the worst case? Financially, emotionally, professionally?

4. **Reframe "waste"**: Time spent learning and exploring isn't wasted even if the outcome fails.

5. **Share with your team**: Getting collective peace with potential failure enables bolder action.

6. **Revisit periodically**: As projects evolve, so do the potential worst cases. Keep checking in.

## When to Use It

- Before launching new products or features
- When making large financial commitments
- Before pivoting or making strategic changes
- When fear is blocking a decision
- Any time uncertainty is causing paralysis
