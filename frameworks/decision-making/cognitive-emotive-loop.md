# Cognitive Emotive Loop

> "When I think a thought like, 'Dara might think I suck' and then I have a thought that I suck, that can become a self-enforcing negative feedback loop where I have a thought that creates stress, anxiety, fear, and then that triggers more thoughts." - JM Nickels

## What It Is

The Cognitive Emotive Loop describes the self-reinforcing cycle between thoughts and emotions that can spiral out of control. A stressful thought triggers an unpleasant emotion (fear, anxiety), which then generates more stressful thoughts, which intensify the emotion, and so on.

This loop is especially common in high-stakes professional situations—important presentations, performance reviews, meetings with executives—where the perceived consequences amplify the initial trigger. Understanding this loop is the first step to breaking it.

The counterintuitive insight is that trying to fight the thoughts with other thoughts often makes things worse. The way out is through allowing, not resisting.

## How It Works

**The Loop Pattern:**
1. **Trigger thought** - "Dara might think I suck"
2. **Emotional response** - Fear, anxiety, tightness in chest
3. **Amplifying thought** - "If I mess this up, my career is over"
4. **Intensified emotion** - Panic, sweaty palms, racing heart
5. **Further catastrophizing** - "Everyone will know I'm a fraud"
6. **Continued escalation** - The cycle repeats and intensifies

**Why Fighting Doesn't Work:**
- "Don't think of a pink elephant" - you immediately think of one
- Trying to suppress thoughts gives them more power
- "What you resist will persist and what you fear will appear"

**The Alternative - Allowing:**
- Recognize thoughts and emotions are transient, not permanent
- Let them arise without fighting or attaching to them
- Return to the present moment and the actual work

## How to Apply It

1. **Recognize you're in the loop** - Notice when your thoughts are spiraling and emotions are escalating. Physical sensations (tight jaw, racing heart, chest pressure) are reliable signals.

2. **Allow rather than resist** - Take a breath and accept that these thoughts and emotions are present. Don't try to push them away or argue with them.

3. **Remember impermanence** - Thoughts and emotions come and go. This feeling will pass. It's not a permanent state.

4. **Decouple self-worth from outcomes** - Remind yourself: "I am okay even if this presentation doesn't go well." Your value as a person is not determined by this one moment.

5. **Return to purpose** - Shift focus from "How will I be perceived?" to "What am I trying to create?" Connection to mission provides a stable foundation.

6. **Reframe feedback as data** - From the trusting, open state, feedback becomes useful information rather than a threat. It's a gift, not an attack.

## When to Use It

- Before important presentations or meetings with executives
- When receiving critical feedback
- During performance reviews or promotion discussions
- When you notice physical stress symptoms (racing heart, shallow breathing)
- When catastrophizing about potential negative outcomes
- Any time you're spiraling into anxiety about professional situations
