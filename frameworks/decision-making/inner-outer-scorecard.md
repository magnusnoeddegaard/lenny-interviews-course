# Inner vs Outer Scorecard

> "Warren Buffett talks about how there's an outer scorecard, which is how the rest of the world evaluates you... And then your inner scorecard is things that actually matter to you—how you spent your day, how good of a person you are." - Ada Chen Rekhi

## What It Is

The Inner vs Outer Scorecard is a mental model from Warren Buffett that helps distinguish between external measures of success and internal measures of fulfillment. Ada Chen Rekhi uses this framework to help people recognize when they're optimizing for the wrong things.

**Outer Scorecard**: How the world evaluates you
- Top 10 lists
- Wealth
- Status
- Title
- Company logos on your resume
- Things that impress others

**Inner Scorecard**: What actually matters to you
- How you spent your day
- How good of a person you are
- Whether you had an adventure today
- Whether you were kind
- Alignment with your values

The insight: these scorecards are often in opposition. You might win on the outer scorecard at the cost of losing on the inner one.

## How It Works

The framework asks a simple question: **Which scorecard are you optimizing for?**

### The "Ego Monster"

Ada's friend describes having an "ego monster" sitting in the corner of the room, constantly yelling to:
- Take the impressive role
- Get the awesome title
- Do something impressive
- Chase external validation

The inner/outer scorecard helps you recognize when the ego monster is driving your decisions—and choose to ignore it.

### The Resume Trap

It's easy to get caught up making your resume look amazing:
- "If I get this next role, my resume will look great"
- "Another prestigious logo"
- "A cooler title"

But Ada warns: you do this long enough, you retire and die. That resume IS your life. There's never a point where you finish optimizing your resume and then ask "what do I actually want?"

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify the scorecards** - For any decision, explicitly list:
   - What would the outer scorecard say? (status, prestige, others' opinions)
   - What would the inner scorecard say? (values, fulfillment, daily experience)

2. **Notice conflicts** - Where do they disagree? That's where the decision gets interesting.

3. **Ask the right question** - Not "what looks impressive?" but "what actually matters to me?"

4. **Watch for the ego monster** - When you feel pulled toward the "obvious" impressive choice, pause and check which scorecard is talking.

### Example from Ada's Life

Ada faced a career opportunity that was:
- High profile and exciting (outer scorecard: yes!)
- Required demanding travel and grueling hours (inner scorecard: no)
- In a space she wasn't excited about (inner scorecard: no)
- Looked amazing on her resume (outer scorecard: yes!)

After doing a values exercise, she realized her top three values would "categorically fail" with this job. She chose her current path instead—which fulfilled all her values.

## When to Use It

- **Career decisions** - Job offers, promotions, company choices
- **Life decisions** - Where to live, how to spend time, relationships
- **Feeling unfulfilled** - When external success doesn't feel satisfying
- **External pressure** - When others expect something different than you want

## The Trap to Avoid

The terrible outcome: waking up late in your career feeling trapped because:
- You have a certain lifestyle to maintain
- Others expect you to keep this job
- You look in the mirror and you're not happy

This happens when you optimize for the outer scorecard for too long without checking the inner one.
