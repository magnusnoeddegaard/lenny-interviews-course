# Embrace Intensity

> "One of the principles that I live by is embrace intensity. It's not create intensity, it's embrace intensity. It means that right now, any moment in my body, for instance, there's going to be a sensation that's more intense. How do I welcome that sensation?" - Joe Hudson

## What It Is

Embrace Intensity is one of Joe Hudson's five life principles—a decision-making rule that, when followed consistently, creates the life he wants. The principle is to welcome and lean into whatever is most intense in any given situation, rather than avoiding or managing it.

Critically, the principle is "embrace" intensity, not "create" intensity. It's about welcoming what's already present—the most intense sensation in your body, the thing nobody wants to discuss in a meeting, the difficult conversation everyone's avoiding. When you lean into what you're trying to avoid, your life and business improve.

This principle operationalizes the Avoidance Invitation Paradox: since avoiding intense experiences invites them back in worse forms, embracing them breaks the cycle.

## How It Works

**In your body:**
- At any moment, some sensation is more intense than others
- Welcome that sensation rather than pulling away from it
- This builds capacity for intensity in all areas

**In business:**
- Every organization has things nobody wants to discuss
- Embrace Intensity means surfacing those topics
- Meeting opener: "What are you scared to say?"
- The thing being avoided is usually the key to improvement

**In relationships:**
- Leaning into difficult conversations rather than postponing them
- Saying the uncomfortable truth with love
- Addressing conflict directly rather than around it

**What it's NOT:**
- Creating drama or intensity where none exists
- Being aggressive or confrontational
- Seeking out problems unnecessarily
- Manufacturing conflict

## How to Apply It

1. **Notice what's intense** - In any situation, identify what's most intense: physically, emotionally, or interpersonally

2. **Notice the pull to avoid** - Register the impulse to look away, change the subject, or manage the intensity

3. **Lean in instead** - Move toward the intensity rather than away from it

4. **In meetings, make it explicit** - Start with "What are you scared to say?" to surface what's being avoided

5. **Trust the result** - When someone criticizes you, instead of defending, respond with "Oh, cool. Tell me what I'm missing"

## When to Use It

- When you notice yourself avoiding something
- When a team seems to be dancing around an issue
- When receiving criticism or feedback
- When physical or emotional discomfort arises
- As a daily practice for building capacity
- In any decision where the "safer" option is actually avoidance

## Examples

**Receiving criticism:**
Someone says: "You're fucking up this business. You're doing it all wrong."
- Avoid response: Defend, dismiss, or counterattack
- Embrace response: "Oh, cool. Tell me what I'm missing."

**In team meetings:**
- Avoid: Stick to the agenda, don't mention the elephant in the room
- Embrace: "What's the thing we're all thinking but nobody's saying?"

**Physical sensation:**
- Avoid: Distract yourself from discomfort, numb out
- Embrace: Feel the intense sensation fully, welcome it
