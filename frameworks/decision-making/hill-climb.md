# Hill Climb (Local vs Global Optimum)

> "You're standing on top of the hill, you're looking down, you can see rolling hills, the sheep, the grass, whatever, but then way off in the distance you can see a mountain. And the thing that gets me through the valley is remembering what the summit feels like." - Ami Vora

## What It Is

The Hill Climb is a mental model for deciding when to pursue transformational change versus continuing to optimize your current position. It's about the difference between a local optimum (the best you can achieve from where you are) and a global optimum (something much better, but requiring you to give things up first).

The imagery: You're standing on a hill. It's nice up here—rolling hills, sheep, grass. You've optimized your current situation. But way off in the distance, you can see a mountain that's much higher. To reach it, you have to:
1. Climb down from your current hill
2. Cross an unknown valley
3. Climb back up just to reach the level where you started
4. Then keep climbing to reach the summit

The question is: Is it worth the certain cost and uncertain reward?

## How It Works

**The Local Optimum Trap:**
When you optimize your current system, you get better and better at it. This feels great—you're improving! But you might be approaching a ceiling. You're on top of a hill, not a mountain.

**The Transformation Decision:**
At some point, you sense there's a much better way. A bigger opportunity. But getting there means:
- Giving up what's working
- Going through a period where things are worse
- No guarantee you'll make it to the mountain

**The Valley:**
This is the hard part. You've left the hill, you haven't reached the mountain, and you're in a slog. Everything feels harder than it should. You question whether this was the right decision.

**The Key Insight:**
"Is it going to be worth going down into the valley, climbing up, keeping climbing? Most of the time the answer is yes."

## Examples

**Companies and Technology:**
> "A lot of companies were really good at desktop and you could see the mobile mountain way out over there, but to get there you had to really make a lot of trade-offs in your core desktop business that you were not totally sure were going to pay off when you made it to the mobile mountain."

**Career Transitions:**
Moving from a role where you've built expertise and relationships to a new challenge where you start from scratch.

**Life Decisions:**
New jobs, moves, relationships—any situation where you're giving up something that works without guaranteed improvement.

## How to Apply It

1. **Recognize where you are** - Are you on a hill (local optimum) or still climbing? Are you seeing diminishing returns from further optimization?

2. **Spot the mountain** - Is there something much better visible in the distance? A fundamentally different approach, market, or path?

3. **Assess the valley** - What would you have to give up? How long would the transition take? What's the worst case?

4. **Make the leap** - If you decide to go, commit fully. Half-measures in the valley just extend the suffering.

5. **Remember the summit** - When you're in the valley and everything is hard, remember what the summit feels like. That's what gets you through.

## When to Use It

- Considering a major career change
- Deciding whether to pivot a product or company
- Evaluating technology platform shifts
- Any situation where optimizing current path has diminishing returns
- When you sense there's a fundamentally better way but the transition is scary

## The Valley Survival Guide

The valley is where most people give up. What gets you through:

1. **Remember past summits** - You've done this before. Recall how it felt when you made it.

2. **Expect the slog** - "Boy, this feels like a slog. It is supposed to? Because I'm still in the valley."

3. **Trust the pattern** - Most of the time, the transformation is worth it. The people who stay on their hills don't regret the stability, but they often wonder about the mountain.
