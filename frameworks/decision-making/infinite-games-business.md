# Infinite Games (Business)

> "[Finite and Infinite Games] espouses, you want to be playing infinite games to be happy in life, games that never end versus games like, I'm going to build a business and sell it. Or, I'm going to go public, that's my goal... You get most joy out of things that never end, like building great relationships, building a company you want to keep working at forever." - Lenny Rachitsky, referencing James Carse's book

## What It Is

Infinite Games (Business) applies James Carse's philosophy to entrepreneurship: instead of building a company to win (exit, IPO, acquisition), build one designed to continue playing indefinitely. The goal isn't to "win" business—it's to keep being in business.

Finite games have clear endpoints: you play to win, and then the game is over. Infinite games have no endpoint: you play to keep playing. Most startups are structured as finite games—build, grow, exit. Infinite games businesses are structured to sustain: remain profitable, maintain independence, continue operating.

This reframe changes everything. Finite game players optimize for exit multiples and growth rates. Infinite game players optimize for sustainability, enjoyment, and indefinite runway. Different games, different strategies, different lives.

## How It Works

**Finite Game Business**:
- Goal: Build to sell or go public
- Timeframe: 5-10 year exit timeline
- Metrics: Growth rate, valuation, market share
- Funding: Venture capital to fuel growth
- Endpoint: Acquisition, IPO, or failure

**Infinite Game Business**:
- Goal: Keep operating profitably
- Timeframe: Indefinite
- Metrics: Profitability, sustainability, satisfaction
- Funding: Bootstrapped or profitable reinvestment
- No endpoint: The game continues as long as you want

**Why Infinite Games Create Joy**:
- No pressure to reach an arbitrary milestone
- You can optimize for daily experience, not eventual outcome
- Building something lasting is more meaningful than building to sell
- Relationships and craft can compound over time
- You're never "done"—which means you're never waiting to start living

## How to Apply It

1. **Choose your game consciously**: Most founders default to finite games without realizing there's an alternative.

2. **Design for sustainability over growth**: What would need to be true to run this business for 25 years?

3. **Skip the exit planning**: Instead of "what's our exit strategy?" ask "how do we never have to exit?"

4. **Invest in craft**: Infinite games reward getting better at what you do. Finite games reward rapid scaling.

5. **Build relationships, not just transactions**: Long-term games benefit from accumulated trust and reputation.

6. **Reject artificial endpoints**: Funding rounds, IPO timelines, acquisition targets—these are finite game constructs.

## When to Use It

- Deciding how to structure your company
- Choosing whether to take funding
- Setting long-term goals and strategy
- Evaluating "success" and what it means to you
- Building company culture and values
