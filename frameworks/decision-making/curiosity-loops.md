# Curiosity Loops

> "Curiosity loops are my method of going to a whole bunch of people and asking them structured questions. I got back such an incredible amount of information for about 20 minutes of work." - Ada Chen Rekhi

## What It Is

A Curiosity Loop is a lightweight, structured method for gathering advice from multiple trusted people on a specific topic or decision. Unlike casually asking friends "what should I do?", this approach uses well-crafted questions sent to carefully selected people, yielding richer, more contextual insights.

The method is inspired by Customer Advisory Councils in marketing, where companies maintain a group of top customers they can quickly ping for product feedback. Ada Chen Rekhi adapted this concept for personal and professional decision-making.

The key insight is that most advice is "bad" not because it's not well-intentioned, but because it's not contextual. Curiosity Loops fight this by gathering multiple perspectives and looking for patterns, surprises, and disagreements.

## How It Works

A Curiosity Loop has four key components:

### 1. Ask a Good Question
Your question should be:
- **Specific** - Not vague like "what should I do with my career?"
- **Solicits rationale** - Ask people to explain why
- **Unbiased** - Don't lead with your opinion

**Bad question:** "What should I do with my career next?"

**Better question:** "You know me. I'm a marketer thinking about doing webdev. My plan is to quit my job, do a bootcamp, then find a job elsewhere. Do you think that's a good idea and why?"

### 2. Curate Who You Ask
Select people along two dimensions:
- **Subject matter experts** - People who know the topic well
- **People who know you** - Those who can assess fit for your situation

Aim for 5-10 people, expecting 3-4 quality responses.

### 3. Make It Lightweight
Design the ask so busy people can respond quickly:
- "Here are 9 topics. Pick your top 2 and tell me why"
- "Yes or no, and here's why"
- Something they can answer from their couch in 5 minutes

Tell people why you picked them specifically.

### 4. Close the Loop
- Process the information and look for patterns
- Thank people for their input
- Share what you decided and how their input helped

Remember: it feels good to help someone. Closing the loop makes people more willing to help again.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify a decision or question** you're wrestling with
2. **Draft a specific question** with clear options or parameters
3. **List 5-10 people** who have relevant expertise or know you well
4. **Craft a lightweight ask** - email, text, or DM that takes <5 minutes to answer
5. **Explain why you picked them** in your outreach
6. **Gather responses** and look for:
   - Consensus (what do most people agree on?)
   - Surprises (what did you not expect?)
   - Strong disagreements (probe these further)
7. **Make your decision** using the input as data, not instruction
8. **Close the loop** by thanking respondents and sharing outcomes

## When to Use It

- **Big decisions** - Career moves, major life choices (use sparingly, ~quarterly)
- **Impasses** - When you and a partner/colleague disagree
- **Unfamiliar territory** - Decisions where you lack direct experience
- **Personal decisions too** - Estate planning, parenting choices, relationship questions

The lightweight version: make it an ongoing theme in conversations, asking the same question repeatedly and looking for patterns.

## Caution

Don't do what people tell you to do. Use the loop to:
- Look around corners for things you missed
- Test the integrity of your decision-making process
- Surface surprises and disagreements to explore

The decision is still yours.
