# Five Principles for Living

> "If you really take a look at what it is you're making your decisions on and then really think about, well, what would be the five or six things that if I made decisions with these principles, I'm guaranteed success?" - Joe Hudson

## What It Is

The Five Principles for Living framework is a method for creating a small set of decision-making principles that, when followed, create the life you want. Rather than making decisions ad hoc, you establish principles that make decisions automatic—when situations arise, you already know what to do.

Joe Hudson emphasizes that we all already have implicit principles guiding our decisions—often unconscious ones like "maximize Facebook likes" or "avoid embarrassment." The framework makes these explicit and replaces them with intentional ones.

The key constraint is keeping it to five principles (not six). Each principle should be tested for five days before adopting it, and each should be defined by both what it is AND what it isn't. When you look at your five principles and say, "If I live by those principles, I'm almost 100% confident that creates the life I want," you have a working set.

## How It Works

**Why principles work:**
- Decisions become automatic—you don't have to think about what to do
- Principles survive emotional states—even on bad days, you follow them
- They create consistency that compounds over time
- They reveal patterns you might otherwise miss

**Joe's example principle: "Embrace Intensity"**
- Not: Create intensity
- Is: Welcome the most intense thing present
- In body: Feel the most intense sensation present
- In business: Address what nobody wants to talk about
- In meetings: "What are you scared to say?"
- Result: Leaning into what's avoided improves life and business

**Characteristics of good principles:**
- Simple enough to remember and apply
- Defined by what it is AND what it isn't
- Tested through experimentation
- Collectively create confidence in life outcomes
- Limited to five (not six)

## How to Apply It

1. **Examine current implicit principles** - What are you actually making decisions based on? (approval, safety, wealth, appearances?)

2. **Draft candidate principles** - What principles, if followed, would create the life you want?

3. **Define each principle both ways** - What it IS and what it ISN'T

4. **Test each principle for five days** - Live by it and notice what happens

5. **Refine and iterate** - Adjust based on experience until you have five that create near-certainty

6. **Follow them even when you don't want to** - The power comes from consistency, especially in moments of resistance

## When to Use It

- When facing a difficult decision (check it against your principles)
- When you notice inconsistency in your choices
- When you want to align your life with your values
- When building a company culture (principles work for organizations too)
- During annual reflection and planning
- When coaching others on decision-making

## Examples of Principles

Joe Hudson's personal principles include:
- **Embrace intensity** - Welcome what's most intense rather than avoiding it
- **Connection first** - Prioritize relationship over outcome
- **Everything is iteration** - Treat all work as experiments, not final products

Other examples might include:
- "Default to action" (vs. "be impulsive")
- "Say the truth with love" (vs. "be brutally honest")
- "Play long-term games" (vs. "ignore short-term needs")
