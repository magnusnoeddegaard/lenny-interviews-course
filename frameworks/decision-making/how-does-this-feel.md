# How Does This Feel?

> "How does this screen feel? How does this flow feel? How does this feature feel? How does this word feel? How does this sentence feel? Because human beings feel. Even if we don't admit it, we are [primarily feeling creatures]. And so I'm always curious about that." - Jason Fried

## What It Is

"How Does This Feel?" is the practice of making emotional and aesthetic responses legitimate topics of professional discussion. Instead of only asking whether something works or performs well by metrics, ask whether it feels right.

This matters because products are experienced by humans, and humans feel before they analyze. The first impression of a screen, flow, or feature is a feeling—not a metric. If that feeling is off, no amount of functionality will fix it.

The question "How does this feel?" opens space for honest responses that "Does this work?" doesn't. Work is binary. Feel is nuanced. Feel captures craft, taste, and fit—the qualities that separate good products from great ones.

## How It Works

**Traditional Product Questions**:
- Does this work correctly?
- Does this meet the spec?
- What do the metrics show?
- Is this on time?

**Adding "Feel" to the Conversation**:
- How does this screen feel when you land on it?
- How does this flow feel as you move through it?
- How does this word feel in this context?
- How does the overall experience feel?

**What "Feel" Captures**:
- First impressions
- Emotional response
- Aesthetic quality
- Comfort and ease
- Trust and confidence
- Delight or frustration

## How to Apply It

1. **Ask it explicitly**: In design reviews, don't just evaluate functionality. Ask directly: "How does this feel?"

2. **Make it safe**: People need permission to share subjective responses. Model it by sharing your own feelings first.

3. **Apply it broadly**: Screens, flows, words, emails, meetings, processes—everything has a feel. Question it all.

4. **Don't demand justification**: When someone says "it feels off," don't immediately ask them to explain why. Sometimes the feeling is valid even when the reasoning is unclear.

5. **Use it in hiring**: Ask candidates how things feel to them. See if they can articulate design sensibility.

6. **Trust the negative feeling**: If something feels wrong, it probably is—even if you can't articulate the problem yet.

## When to Use It

- Design reviews and product critiques
- Evaluating copy and messaging
- User experience discussions
- Hiring designers and product people
- Any situation where craft matters
