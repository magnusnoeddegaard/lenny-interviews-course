# Macro-Middle-Micro Research Framework

> "At the root of all that, I think, is that we're just doing too much of what I would consider the wrong type of research." - Judd Antin

## What It Is

The Macro-Middle-Micro Research Framework is a way to categorize user research by its strategic altitude and business impact. Most research teams spend too much time in the "middle range" - interesting but not impactful work - while underinvesting in macro (strategic) and micro (tactical) research that drives real business outcomes.

The framework helps research teams and their partners prioritize the types of research most likely to create value, rather than defaulting to research that feels important but doesn't move the needle.

## How It Works

### Macro Research (Strategic)
- Big picture, forward-looking, innovation-focused
- Tied to annual planning and long-term strategy
- Examples: competitive landscape analysis, concept car projects, TAM studies, 5-year product vision research
- Timeline: Weeks to months, aligned with planning cycles

### Middle Range Research (The Danger Zone)
- Medium altitude questions about user understanding
- Interesting to researchers and stakeholders
- Often requested by PMs but disconnected from specific business metrics
- Example: "How do Airbnb hosts feel about their payment options?"
- Risk: Yields insights that are "obvious" in hindsight or hard to operationalize

### Micro Research (Tactical)
- Laser-focused on specific product improvements
- Directly tied to conversion funnels and business metrics
- Examples: usability testing, CTA optimization, understanding AB test results
- Timeline: 48 hours to a week
- Often dismissed as "junior work" but drives massive business value

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your current research portfolio** - Categorize recent studies by altitude. If most fall in the middle range, you have a problem.

2. **Increase micro research** - Stop treating usability testing as scut work. Quick, tactical studies that improve conversion can be worth millions (Airbnb's "multimillion dollar button" came from micro research).

3. **Tie macro research to planning cycles** - Ensure strategic research feeds directly into annual planning and roadmap decisions, not ad-hoc explorations.

4. **Make middle range research more pointed** - If you must do middle range research, connect it explicitly to business metrics, funnels, and OKRs. Transform "How do users feel about X?" into "What's blocking conversion at step Y?"

5. **Staff appropriately** - Senior researchers should do micro research. It's not beneath them - it's where fast impact lives.

## When to Use It

- When prioritizing a research roadmap
- When receiving research requests from stakeholders
- When evaluating whether research is driving business impact
- When explaining to executives why some research matters more than others
