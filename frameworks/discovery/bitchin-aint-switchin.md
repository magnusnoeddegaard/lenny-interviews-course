# Bitchin' Ain't Switchin'

> "Just because people bitch about something doesn't mean they're going to do anything about it." - Bob Moesta

## What It Is

"Bitchin' Ain't Switchin'" is a heuristic for evaluating customer feedback, particularly feature requests and complaints. Developed by Bob Moesta as part of his work with companies like Basecamp, it reminds product teams that expressed dissatisfaction does not predict behavior change.

The key insight is that people will readily articulate problems and wish-list items, but the presence of complaints doesn't indicate they'll actually switch products or change behavior. What causes people to take action is fundamentally different from what causes them to complain.

## How It Works

### Complaints Don't Predict Action

Customers may loudly request features while having no intention of leaving:

**Basecamp Example:**
> "Everybody said, 'Oh, if you had Gantt charts, I'm going to leave you if you don't put Gantt charts in or resource allocation,' and as much as they all say they want it, they're not leaving because of it."

The threat is empty—they're not actually switching. Adding the requested feature could even backfire:

> "One of the reasons why people join Basecamp is because it's so dang simple. And if I start to add all these things that make it more complicated, it doesn't work."

### What Actually Predicts Action

Instead of trusting what people say they'll do, look for:

1. **Actual behavior change** - People who already switched
2. **Struggling moments** - Specific contexts that forced action
3. **Failed attempts** - People who tried to change, even unsuccessfully
4. **The Four Forces** - Push, pull, anxiety, and habit in play

### Why People Complain But Don't Switch

The Four Forces of Progress explain this gap:

- **F3 (Anxiety of New)**: The unknown is scary, even if current situation is frustrating
- **F4 (Habit of Present)**: Switching costs are high—learning curves, migration, integration

Complaints are cheap. Switching is expensive.

## How to Apply It

### 1. Filter Feature Requests

When customers request features or threaten to leave:

| Instead of... | Ask... |
|--------------|--------|
| "Let's add that feature" | "Has anyone actually left because of this?" |
| "This is a must-have" | "Who has switched to a competitor for this?" |
| "Customers are demanding X" | "Show me customers who took action, not just complained" |

### 2. Study Switchers, Not Complainers

Interview people who actually changed behavior:
- People who recently bought your product (why did they leave the old thing?)
- People who churned from your product (what actually made them switch?)
- People who switched to competitors (what was the triggering event?)

### 3. Understand the Difference

| Complainers | Switchers |
|------------|-----------|
| Articulate problems | Took action despite friction |
| Express preferences | Made trade-offs |
| Threaten without consequences | Had enough push + pull |
| Report what annoys them | Report what broke the camel's back |

### 4. Don't Follow Your Best Users Upmarket

A specific risk of listening to vocal complainers:

> "If you follow your best users, they'll take you up to this world that then actually destroys the lower end of the world of why people are there."

Power users request advanced features, but those features can make the product too complex for the majority.

### 5. Look for Struggling Moments, Not Wish Lists

Instead of asking "What features do you want?" ask:
- "Tell me about the last time you were really frustrated with [category]"
- "What made you finally decide to look for something new?"
- "What almost made you quit using this?"

Struggling moments predict action. Wish lists don't.

## When to Use It

- **Prioritizing feature requests**: Filter noise from signal
- **Evaluating competitive threats**: Are customers actually leaving?
- **Designing roadmaps**: Build for struggling moments, not feature parity
- **Analyzing feedback**: Distinguish complaints from causes of churn
- **Responding to "customers want X"**: Verify with actual behavior

## Common Mistakes

1. **Taking complaints at face value** - Volume of complaints ≠ likelihood of action
2. **Building for vocal minorities** - Squeaky wheels aren't necessarily switching
3. **Competing on features** - Simplicity can be your moat
4. **Surveying intentions** - "Would you use this?" is unreliable
5. **Fearing competitor feature lists** - Customers may not actually switch for those features
