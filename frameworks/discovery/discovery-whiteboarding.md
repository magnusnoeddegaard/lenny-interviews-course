# Discovery Whiteboarding

> "That first session was a whiteboarding session, and we would actually get together and have you draw your architecture for payments... The customer also learned a lot themselves because in many cases they'd never drawn their architecture diagram." - Jeanne DeWitt Grosser

## What It Is

Discovery Whiteboarding transforms the traditional discovery call—which often feels like an interrogation—into a collaborative working session. Instead of asking a list of qualifying questions, you work together with the prospect to visualize their current state, identify gaps, and explore solutions.

The approach comes from recognizing that traditional discovery can feel boring or extractive to customers. You're essentially quizzing them. Whiteboarding sessions flip this dynamic: customers leave with a tangible asset (a diagram, framework, or analysis) regardless of whether they buy, and salespeople gain deeper understanding than a question-answer format provides.

This technique was developed at Stripe where sales teams would have prospects draw their payments architecture on a whiteboard. The exercise revealed technical details, pain points, and decision-making dynamics that traditional questions wouldn't surface.

## How It Works

1. **Set Up the Session**: Frame it as a collaborative working session, not a demo or pitch. Bring a digital whiteboard or physical whiteboard to the meeting.

2. **Have Them Draw**: Ask the customer to map out their current state—their architecture, their process, their org structure, whatever's relevant to your solution.

3. **Ask Questions While Drawing**: As they sketch, probe deeper. "What happens when X fails?" "Who owns this piece?" "Why was this decision made?"

4. **Add Context and Benchmarks**: Share what you've seen at similar companies. "Most companies at your scale have moved this piece to..." or "That's an unusual approach—is that by design?"

5. **Identify Gaps Together**: Rather than telling them their problems, help them discover gaps by asking questions about their diagram.

6. **Leave Them Something Valuable**: Send them the diagram, add annotations, provide a summary of insights—something useful regardless of the sale.

## How to Apply It

1. **Choose What to Diagram**: Identify the central artifact that reveals how your product would fit:
   - For infrastructure: Technical architecture
   - For workflow tools: Current process flow
   - For org tools: Team structure and responsibilities
   - For strategy products: Current strategic positioning

2. **Prepare Good Prompts**: Instead of "Tell me about your tech stack," try "Can you sketch out how data flows from your customer-facing app to your internal systems?"

3. **Be Genuinely Curious**: The technique fails if you're just going through motions. You should be learning as much as them.

4. **Have Insights Ready**: Know enough about common patterns in your domain to add value during the session.

5. **Practice Active Listening**: Notice what they struggle to draw, what they skip over, what they seem uncertain about—these are all signals.

6. **Follow Up with Value**: Send them the artifact, add best-practice annotations, or share how similar companies have structured things differently.

## When to Use It

- When selling complex products that need to integrate with existing systems
- When there's no single decision maker and you need to understand the org
- When prospects don't fully understand their own current state
- When you want to differentiate from competitors who do standard demos
- When building trust and credibility is important to the sale
