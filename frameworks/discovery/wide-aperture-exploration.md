# Wide Aperture Exploration

> "I am definitely not the smartest person in the room when it comes to figuring these things out. And so, I keep a very, very wide aperture on ideas for as long as I can until I'm like, okay, everything is coalescing." - Jason Droege

## What It Is

Wide Aperture Exploration is an approach to new business ideation that deliberately maintains openness to a broad range of possibilities before converging on a direction. Rather than quickly committing to the first promising idea, this framework involves exploring many options—including ones that seem bad at first—until signals start aligning and pointing toward a clear opportunity.

The approach acknowledges that the person exploring doesn't need to be the smartest in the room; they just need to be thorough and patient enough to let the right answer reveal itself.

## How It Works

The framework operates in phases:

**Expansion Phase**
- Cast a wide net across potential opportunities
- Don't dismiss ideas that seem bad at first glance
- Keep digging to verify if initial assessments are correct
- Conduct hands-on experiments, not just analysis

**Validation Phase**
- Run real-world tests, even crude ones
- Look for signals that something is working (or not)
- Let data override initial assumptions
- Kill ideas decisively when they don't work

**Convergence Phase**
- Wait until signals from multiple sources align
- Look for ideas that "pop off on all signals"
- Ensure unit economics work alongside market demand
- Only then commit resources and focus

## How to Apply It

1. **Start broad deliberately** - When exploring new opportunities, resist the urge to commit early. Explore 15 versions of different ideas.

2. **Test with real experiments** - Droege's team launched convenience vans with 250 SKUs, tested point-to-point delivery, experimented with multiple food delivery models. Real tests beat analysis.

3. **Follow the signals** - When Uber Eats launched in Toronto and did $20,000 in sales in two hours, that was a signal. When the convenience vans got crickets, that was also a signal.

4. **Verify your doubts** - If an idea seems bad, keep digging to confirm. You might be wrong. If an idea seems good, stress test it to make sure you're not fooling yourself.

5. **Commit decisively once signals align** - Wide aperture exploration doesn't mean endless exploration. When the unit economics work and people clearly want it, go all in.

## When to Use It

- Starting a new company or business unit
- Exploring adjacent markets from an existing business
- Evaluating which problems to solve in a new domain
- Whenever you don't have high confidence in a single direction

## Example: The Uber Eats Discovery

Droege's team explored many ideas before landing on Uber Eats:
- Convenience vans with 250 SKUs (failed - crickets)
- Grocery delivery (passed - unit economics too scary)
- Generalized point-to-point delivery (failed - no demand)
- 15 other variations

Food delivery kept showing signals: demand existed, unit economics could work, the problem was interesting (helping independent restaurants compete). They only committed after "the food delivery thing is just popping off on all signals."
