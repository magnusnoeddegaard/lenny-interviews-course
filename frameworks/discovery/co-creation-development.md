# Co-Creation Development

> "We don't want to spend tons of time upfront just designing it, then polishing it perfectly. We actually believe that when you start building the thing you actually start realizing more how it should work and how it should be better... We look for a customer that could be interested in this feature or we just ask people to opt into some better program." - Karri Saarinen

## What It Is

Co-Creation Development is a product development approach where features are shipped early to internal users and select customers, allowing real usage to inform the design before general release. Rather than perfecting a feature in isolation and then launching, teams build quickly, ship internally, then work with specific customers to refine the experience.

This approach recognizes that building the thing teaches you how it should work—insights that can't be gained from design documents alone. By involving real users early in the process, teams learn faster and avoid over-investing in approaches that don't work in practice.

Linear uses this extensively, often partnering with specific companies (like Vercel) to develop features that serve larger customer needs.

## How It Works

**The Development Stages:**

1. **Early internal release** - Ship features to the internal team within the first week of building, even if rough

2. **Opt-in beta program** - Invite customers to opt into seeing early features

3. **Partner customer development** - Work closely with 1-5 specific customers on features designed for their use cases

4. **General release** - Only after refinement based on real usage do features go to everyone

**What makes this different:**
- The "jankiness" is okay in early stages because expectations are set
- Real usage reveals problems design documents can't anticipate
- The polish comes at the end, not the beginning
- Customer input happens during development, not after

**The co-creation relationship:**
For significant features, Linear finds customers who:
- Have the use case the feature addresses
- Are willing to work through rough early versions
- Can provide detailed, actionable feedback
- Have contexts that stress-test the design

## How to Apply It

1. **Ship to internal users immediately** - Get features into the real product (even behind flags) within the first week

2. **Set appropriate expectations** - Make it clear to early testers that features aren't finished

3. **Identify co-creation partners** - For significant features, find 1-5 customers with relevant use cases who want to participate

4. **Create feedback mechanisms** - Make it easy for co-creation partners to share what's working and what isn't

5. **Iterate rapidly** - Use feedback to adjust direction while still building

6. **Reserve polish for the end** - Don't spend time perfecting UI details until the core design is validated

7. **Release when ready, not when scheduled** - General release happens when the feature meets quality standards, not by arbitrary deadlines

**The progression:**
```
Internal team → Opt-in beta → Partner customers → General release
   (Day 7)        (Week 2)        (Week 3-6)         (When ready)
```

## When to Use It

**Most valuable for:**
- Complex features where real usage is needed to understand requirements
- Features designed for specific customer segments
- Products where first impressions at general release matter
- Teams that want to balance speed with quality

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires customers willing to use unfinished features
- More coordination overhead than just building and launching
- Early versions may create expectations that change
- Not all features need this level of co-creation

**The Linear philosophy:**
"Sometimes people think that craft is about perfecting things and perfecting them in a very organized way or very early on. The downside with this perfection mindset is that it can be sometimes hard to put anything out because nothing is ever fully perfect."

**Example - Roadmap feature:**
Linear worked with Vercel on changes to their roadmap feature. Vercel explained how they worked, provided feedback along the way, and the feature evolved based on real usage rather than assumptions.
