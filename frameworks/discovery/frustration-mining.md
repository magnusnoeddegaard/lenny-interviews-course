# Frustration Mining

> "Go look from the last week. For a week, just pay attention to what you do and what frustrates you. And when something frustrates you, think about, is there anything we can do? Can it be done a different way?" - Chip Huyen

## What It Is

A systematic approach to generating product ideas by deliberately tracking personal frustrations over time. Rather than brainstorming in a vacuum, frustration mining turns everyday annoyances into product opportunities.

The framework addresses a paradox: we have more powerful tools than ever to build things, yet many people don't know what to build. The answer lies in paying attention to friction in daily life.

## How It Works

**The Idea Crisis:**

Despite having AI tools that can design, write code, and build websites from scratch, people are stuck not knowing what to build. The root cause:
- Over-specialization means people lack the "big picture view" needed to see opportunities
- We've become habituated to friction points and stopped noticing them
- We look for ideas in the wrong places (news, trends) instead of in our own experience

**The Frustration Mining Process:**

1. **Observe** - For one week, consciously notice what frustrates you
2. **Document** - Write down each frustration as it happens (not retrospectively)
3. **Analyze** - For each frustration, ask: "Can this be done differently?"
4. **Share** - Swap frustrations with teammates to cross-pollinate ideas
5. **Build** - Create micro-tools to solve the frustrations worth addressing

## How to Apply It

**Daily Practice:**
- Keep a frustration log (notes app, voice memos, physical notebook)
- Set a reminder to check in 3x daily: "What frustrated me since the last check-in?"
- Include both work and personal frustrations—some of the best tools solve personal problems

**Team Exercise (Hackathon-style):**
1. Have everyone track frustrations for a week before the session
2. Share frustrations in groups, looking for common themes
3. Identify frustrations that seem addressable with current technology
4. Build quick prototypes to test solutions

**Lenny's Example:**
Frustrated by not being able to extract images from Google Docs, Lenny used vibe coding tools to build a micro-app that takes a Google Doc URL and downloads all images. A real personal frustration became a useful tool.

## When to Use It

- When planning hackathons or innovation sprints
- When teams feel stuck on what to build
- When evaluating AI use cases for your company
- When wanting to stay connected to user problems
- As ongoing practice for product-minded professionals
