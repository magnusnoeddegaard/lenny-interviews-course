# Four Forces of Progress

> "If F1 and F2 are not greater than F3 and F4, they're not going to move, they're not going to do anything." - Bob Moesta

## What It Is

The Four Forces of Progress is a model for understanding what causes people to change their behavior—to switch from one product to another, adopt something new, or make any significant decision. Developed by Bob Moesta as part of the Jobs to Be Done methodology, it frames the market as a system of behavior, not a competitive landscape of features.

The key insight is that adding more features (pull) often backfires because it increases anxiety. Sometimes reducing friction on the opposing forces is more effective than increasing the driving forces.

## How It Works

There are two forces that drive change and two forces that resist it:

```
                    [New Product/Behavior]
                           ↑
         F2: Pull to New Solution ────┐
                                      │
    ════════════════════════════════════════════
                                      │
         F3: Anxiety of the New ──────┘

         F4: Habit of the Present ────┐
                                      │
    ════════════════════════════════════════════
                                      │
         F1: Push of Current Situation ┘
                           ↑
                    [Old Product/Behavior]
```

### F1: Push of the Current Situation
What's pushing someone away from their current state. This has nothing to do with your new product—it's purely about the problems, frustrations, or changed circumstances that make someone think "I need to do something different."

Examples:
- The old car has 280,000 miles and made three expensive repairs recently
- There's a long trip coming up
- The current software can't handle the team's growth

### F2: Pull to the New Solution
The attraction of the new outcome or product. This is what most marketing focuses on—features, benefits, the promise of a better state.

Examples:
- A new car with better fuel economy and safety features
- Software that automates tedious manual work
- A home that's closer to the kids

### F3: Anxiety of the New
The fear and uncertainty that comes with any change. Importantly, **more features increase anxiety** because people wonder "Can it really do all that?" This is why a "kick-ass half is better than a half-ass whole" (Jason Fried's principle).

Examples:
- "Will this new software actually work for our workflow?"
- "What if I hate the new neighborhood?"
- "What if I lose all my data in the migration?"

### F4: Habit of the Present
The inertia of current behavior, even when it's suboptimal. People are creatures of habit, and leaving the familiar is hard—even when they complain about it.

Examples:
- "I know how to use the old system, even if it's frustrating"
- "All my stuff is here, I don't want to move"
- "My team is used to the current process"

## The Critical Equation

**For change to happen: F1 + F2 > F3 + F4**

If the driving forces don't outweigh the resisting forces, people won't move—no matter how good your product is.

## How to Apply It

### 1. Don't Just Add Pull (Features)

Most companies default to adding more features to increase F2. But:
- More features can increase F3 (anxiety) more than F2 (pull)
- Features don't address F4 (habits)
- Features are irrelevant if F1 (push) isn't strong enough

### 2. Reduce F3 (Anxiety) Through Trust

- Offer demos, trials, money-back guarantees
- Show social proof from similar customers
- Break the change into smaller, reversible steps
- Provide migration assistance

### 3. Reduce F4 (Habit) Through Friction Removal

Bob's real estate example: Downsizers said they didn't want dining rooms. But they weren't buying because they didn't know how to handle moving all their stuff.

**Solution**: Include moving services and 2 years of storage in the condo price.

**Result**: Sales increased 30%—by reducing friction, not adding features.

### 4. Ensure F1 (Push) Exists

If there's no push, people can't even see your product. Before marketing your solution, understand:
- What struggling moments cause people to start looking?
- What context changed in their life?
- What made "today the day" they decided to act?

### 5. Interview to Find the Forces

When talking to customers who switched, identify all four forces:
- **Push**: "What was going on that made you look for something new?"
- **Pull**: "What did you hope the new solution would do for you?"
- **Anxiety**: "What were you worried about? What made you hesitate?"
- **Habit**: "What did you have to give up? What was hard to let go of?"

## When to Use It

- **Diagnosing low conversion**: Which force is blocking people?
- **Competitive analysis**: What habits keep people with competitors?
- **Pricing strategy**: What friction can you reduce that's worth more than a feature?
- **Sales process design**: Which force should each conversation address?
- **Product design**: Where does adding features hurt more than help?

## Common Mistakes

1. **Assuming more features = more adoption** - Often backfires
2. **Ignoring F3 and F4** - The invisible forces that kill deals
3. **Not understanding customer context** - F1 requires deep customer understanding
4. **Fighting habits with logic** - Habits are emotional, not rational
