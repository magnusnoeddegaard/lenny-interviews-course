# Reference Customer Development

> "The holy grail of product work is really a reference customer. This is somebody that has used your solution or your product, loves it enough to tell people about it." - Christian Idiodi

## What It Is

Reference Customer Development is a discovery technique where you simultaneously discover who has a problem AND develop a solution with them—working closely with real customers until they're willing to put their reputation on the line by recommending your product to others.

Unlike traditional user research where you interview customers and then build separately, this technique immerses you in the customer's environment. You solve their problem directly, iterating until they're genuinely delighted. The ultimate validation isn't what they say—it's whether they'll stake their reputation on your product.

Christian Idiodi considers this the "holy grail of product work" and credits it for never having a product failure across over 200 products he's worked on.

## How It Works

### The Magic Numbers
- **B2B**: 6-8 reference customers
- **B2C**: 15-25 reference customers (enough to launch with 25 5-star reviews)

### Why These Numbers?
The numbers are based on social proof research:
- If you can only find 1-2 customers with the problem, it might not be a real problem worth solving
- IBM research found enterprise buyers want to see 5-6 similar companies using a product before committing
- For B2C, App Store and review data shows 25 positive reviews creates sufficient social proof for adoption
- Most people don't want to be the first to try something—they need to see others like them who have accepted it

### The Process

1. **Find someone with the problem**
   - Get out of your building
   - Immerse yourself in the environment of the problem
   - Don't leave until you solve the problem

2. **Work with them to solve it**
   - You're not interviewing—you're actually solving
   - Include your designer and engineer from day one
   - Iterate until they genuinely love the solution

3. **Ask for the commitment**
   - "If I create a solution you love, will you tell people about it?"
   - This could be: video testimonial, written review, case study, reference call
   - If they hesitate, dig into why—this reveals real feedback

4. **Repeat until you hit your number**
   - You may need to work with 30-50 people to get 25 references
   - Not everyone will love it enough—that's valuable learning
   - All references must want the same thing (no fragmentation)

## How to Apply It

1. **Define the problem you believe exists** - Be clear about who you think has this problem and what it is

2. **Recruit your first potential reference customers** - Look for "technologists" (love trying new things) and "evangelists" (early adopters who believe they have the problem)

3. **Get permission for the arrangement** - "I'm trying to build the best solution for [problem]. If I create something you love, will you be willing to tell people about it?"

4. **Immerse yourself in their world** - Go to where they are, watch them struggle, try to solve the problem together

5. **Iterate until delighted** - Keep working until they proactively want to recommend you—hesitation reveals the gaps

6. **Hit your target number** - Don't launch until you have 6-8 (B2B) or 15-25 (B2C) committed references

7. **Then scale** - Now you know what works, you can build technology to do it efficiently

## When to Use It

- **Starting a new product from scratch** - This is the fastest path to product-market fit
- **Entering a new market** - Validate the problem exists at sufficient scale
- **Building B2B products** - Enterprise buyers specifically want to see reference customers
- **Consumer apps before launch** - Never launch with zero reviews
- **When you want to eliminate product failure risk** - This technique removes uncertainty

## Real Example: High-Volume Hiring Product

Christian used this technique at a staffing company:

1. **Problem identified**: Starbucks needed to hire 800 people quickly for an acquisition
2. **First test**: Tried helping McDonald's hire for a new location—learned most people don't show up for interviews
3. **Iterated**: Doubled efforts, called people back, figured out what channels worked
4. **Second customer (Starbucks)**: Applied learnings, hired 784 people in one week
5. **Discovery continues**: Los Angeles Airport needed different requirements—learned airports aren't their customer
6. **Refined target**: Found their customer was new store openings needing high-volume hiring quickly
7. **Result**: $32 million in sales in the first 90 days after launch

The designer and engineer were involved from day one—they never wrote requirements documents because they were immersed in solving the problem.
