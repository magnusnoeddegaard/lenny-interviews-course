# Falsify Don't Validate

> "One of my big mantras was, 'We don't validate, we falsify. We are looking to be wrong.' That is the mindset you should use when you're approaching insights and research. 'I want to be wrong. I want you to do research that shows we were off base in the following ways. Tell me exactly how and why in a way that allows me to fix it quickly.'" - Judd Antin

## What It Is

Falsify Don't Validate is a mindset for approaching user research and product decisions. Instead of seeking research to confirm your assumptions (validation), you actively seek to disprove them (falsification). This approach, borrowed from the scientific method, counteracts confirmation bias and leads to genuine learning.

Most PMs and designers approach research wanting to be right. They're looking for validation. But this mindset leads to User-Centered Performance - symbolic research that doesn't change decisions. The falsification mindset flips this: you want research to prove you wrong, quickly, so you can adjust.

## How It Works

### The Validation Trap
- You have a hypothesis about what to build
- You design research to "test" it
- You unconsciously filter for confirming evidence
- Research "validates" your plan
- You build what you were going to build anyway
- You've learned nothing and may be wrong

### The Falsification Approach
- You have a hypothesis about what to build
- You explicitly seek disconfirming evidence
- You design research to find flaws in your thinking
- You welcome being wrong as a learning opportunity
- Research reveals blind spots and adjustments
- You build something better

### Connection to Science
Karl Popper's philosophy of science established that hypotheses can never be proven true - they can only be proven false. The strongest theories are those that have survived many attempts at falsification. The same applies to product hypotheses.

## How to Apply It

1. **Reframe your research questions** - Instead of "Will users like this feature?" ask "What would make users reject this feature?"

2. **Seek disconfirming evidence** - Actively look for users who don't fit your model, edge cases that break your assumptions, or contexts where your solution fails.

3. **Reward being wrong** - Celebrate when research disproves a hypothesis. That's learning. Being "right" often means you weren't really testing anything.

4. **Create psychological safety** - Teams need to feel safe being wrong. If failure is punished, people will seek validation instead of truth.

5. **Ask the kill question** - "What would have to be true for us NOT to do this?" Then research whether those conditions exist.

## When to Use It

- Before committing significant resources to a direction
- When you notice yourself seeking "validation" research
- When research consistently confirms existing beliefs (suspicious)
- When designing user studies and interview guides

## The Test

Before any research project, ask yourself honestly:
- "If this research shows I'm wrong, will I change course?"
- "Am I genuinely uncertain, or just seeking permission?"
- "What would falsify my hypothesis?"

If you can't answer these, you might be performing rather than learning.
