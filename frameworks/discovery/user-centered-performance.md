# User-Centered Performance

> "User-centered performance refers to customer obsession or user-centered practice that is symbolic rather than focused on learning. It's hugely common, I would argue. It's work we do to signal to each other how customer obsessed we are, not because we want to make a different decision." - Judd Antin

## What It Is

User-Centered Performance is the phenomenon where teams and individuals engage in customer research and user-centered practices primarily for show - to signal customer obsession - rather than to genuinely learn and make different decisions. It's performative user-centeredness that checks boxes without changing outcomes.

This pattern is extremely common in tech companies. It manifests when people have already decided what to build but go through the motions of research to feel validated or appear customer-focused.

## How It Works

### Explicit Forms
- **End-of-process validation**: "Can you just run a quick user study to validate our assumptions?" (It's too late to matter - they're shipping regardless)
- **Executive listening sessions**: Leaders wanting to "get close to the customer" through focus groups they attend, but not actually changing decisions based on what they hear
- **Check-the-box research**: Any research done primarily to satisfy a process requirement rather than answer a genuine question

### Implicit Forms
- **Confirmation bias**: Interpreting research to support pre-existing beliefs
- **Ego protection**: Avoiding research that might prove you wrong
- **Selective attention**: Only hearing insights that align with the planned direction

### The Core Tell
Ask yourself: "Would I be willing to be wrong? Would I change my plans based on what I learn?" If the honest answer is no, you're performing.

## How to Apply It

1. **Adopt the falsification mindset** - Replace "validate my assumptions" with "I want to be wrong. Show me where my thinking is flawed."

2. **Time the research right** - Research done at the end of a process is almost always performance. If you're not willing to change course based on findings, don't pretend to do research.

3. **Check your emotional response** - If research findings make you defensive rather than curious, you were performing, not learning.

4. **Be honest about the purpose** - Sometimes you genuinely need to check a box (regulatory, stakeholder management). Own that. Don't pretend it's learning.

5. **Create genuine uncertainty** - Only commission research when you have real questions and are genuinely unsure of the answer.

## When to Use It

- When evaluating whether a research request is genuine
- When noticing defensiveness to research findings
- When research consistently "validates" existing plans
- When auditing organizational customer-centricity claims

## Red Flags That You're Performing

- Research is scheduled after the decision is made
- Findings never change the direction
- The same insights keep "confirming" what leadership believes
- Research questions are framed to get the desired answer
- Teams cite "user research" but can't point to decisions it changed
