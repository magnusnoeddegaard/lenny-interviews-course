# Social Radar Framework

> "My three co-founders were deeply technical people, and I was not. But I would look at other things about founders. When we'd have these 10-minute interviews, I would look at, do the co-founders get along? Are these people committed? Do they really know about their product? Do they care? Are they going to quit their job? All these little social cues." - Jessica Livingston

## What It Is

The Social Radar Framework is Jessica Livingston's methodology for evaluating early-stage founders by observing social cues, interpersonal dynamics, and behavioral signals rather than focusing solely on technical capabilities or business metrics. This approach became one of Y Combinator's secret weapons in identifying successful founders when there was minimal data available.

At the pre-seed stage, there's very little data to work with - often just an idea and a team. The Social Radar compensates for this by extracting maximum signal from how founders present themselves, interact with each other, and respond to challenges during brief encounters.

The framework operates on the principle that certain behavioral patterns and personality traits are strong predictors of startup success, particularly at the earliest stages when the team matters more than the idea.

## How It Works

### Key Signals to Observe

**1. Co-founder Dynamics**
- Do they finish each other's sentences?
- Does one founder interrupt or prevent the other from speaking?
- Is there balanced participation in conversations?
- Do they have a shared history (school, work, family)?

**2. Defensiveness vs. Openness**
- How do founders respond when challenged?
- Can they engage in "tennis match" conversations?
- Do they close up or have spirited debates?
- Can they say "I don't know" without discomfort?

**3. Commitment Level**
- Are they willing to quit their jobs?
- Have they "burned the boat"?
- Do they show signs of desperation and urgency?

**4. Earnestness and Authenticity**
- Do they genuinely care about the problem?
- Are they doing this for the right reasons?
- Is there substance behind any charisma?
- Are they trying to educate or perform?

**5. Domain Expertise**
- Are they fixing their own problem?
- Do they have deep knowledge of a broken industry?
- Can they speak with authority about their space?

**6. Resourcefulness**
- Have they demonstrated scrappiness?
- Can they "make shit happen"?
- Do they show creative problem-solving?

### Red Flags

- Unequal equity splits (99/1) without clear justification
- Founders who don't plan to quit their jobs
- Co-founders who just met to start the company
- "Hackers in a cage" - technical founders with no voice in direction
- Doing it because it's cool, not because they care
- Avoiding questions or using smoke and mirrors

## How to Apply It

1. **Prepare your observation checklist** - Before evaluating founders, know what social signals you're looking for (commitment, co-founder dynamics, defensiveness, earnestness)

2. **Let conversations flow naturally** - Don't just fire questions. Have genuine dialogue and observe how founders engage

3. **Watch the dynamics** - Pay attention to who speaks, who interrupts, how they refer to each other

4. **Challenge their ideas** - Ask probing questions and observe: Do they get defensive or engage thoughtfully?

5. **Ask revealing questions**:
   - "How did you two meet?"
   - "Are you planning to quit your job?"
   - "Why is the equity split structured this way?"
   - "Why are you working on this problem specifically?"

6. **Trust your instincts** - If something feels off, investigate. Follow up on your gut feelings

7. **Track your predictions** - Note your strong impressions and follow up years later to validate your instincts

## When to Use It

- Evaluating early-stage founders when there's minimal data
- Making hiring decisions, especially for leadership roles
- Assessing co-founder compatibility before starting a company
- Due diligence on any people-centric investment
- Building teams where interpersonal dynamics matter
