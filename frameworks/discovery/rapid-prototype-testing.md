# Rapid Prototype Testing

> "We would have an idea in the morning, come up with some sort of functional prototype, recruit a bunch of people that are legitimately good prospective users, but have zero skin in the game. Ship fast so people can start playing with it. In the afternoon, we're already running pretty full scale experiment." - Grant Lee

## What It Is

Rapid Prototype Testing is a compressed discovery cycle that moves from idea to validated learning within a single day. Rather than spending weeks building and then testing, you create a minimal functional prototype (using AI tools like Cursor, Lovable, or traditional code), immediately recruit users through platforms, and gather feedback within hours.

The key innovation is treating user research as automated infrastructure rather than a heavyweight process. By setting up the right platforms and processes once, testing becomes as fast as building.

Grant Lee describes how Gamma uses this for everything: landing pages, onboarding, new features, exports, sharing—every piece of the product goes through rapid validation before significant investment.

## How It Works

**Morning: Generate the Idea**
Start with a hypothesis or concept worth testing. This could be a new feature, a different onboarding flow, or an alternative interface.

**Afternoon: Build the Prototype**
Create something functional enough to test. This doesn't need to be production-ready:
- Use AI coding tools (Cursor, Lovable) for quick prototypes
- Leverage designers who can code
- Build wireframes or functional mockups

**Afternoon: Recruit Users**
Use platforms that source qualified testers:
- **Voicepanel** (YC company) - automated recruitment and testing
- **UserTesting** - source users by persona, job function, behaviors

Key: Recruit people who are legitimate prospective users but have "zero skin in the game"—they don't care if your product succeeds, so they'll be honest.

**Evening/Next Day: Analyze Results**
Watch users go through the prototype:
- Listen to them describe what they're seeing and doing
- Observe where they struggle
- Identify what's confusing vs. intuitive

**The Gift of Struggle**
"You're so familiar with your own product, everything feels kind of easy and you know where things are, but when you start actually hearing other people describe their usage of the product, that's a gift."

## How to Apply It

### Setting Up the Infrastructure

1. **Onboard your team on platforms** - Once set up, testing becomes trivially easy
2. **Define key personas** - Know who you want to test with (job function, behaviors, demographics)
3. **Create testing templates** - Standard scripts for common research goals
4. **Build feedback review rituals** - Regular team sessions to go through results together

### Running Tests

5. **Keep prototypes small** - Never spend 4 months building something before testing it
6. **Test at 20 users per concept** - Enough signal without over-investing
7. **Chunk features down** - Test inception-level ideas, not massive features

### Acting on Results

8. **Kill ideas early** - "A bunch of ideas die right away, but they're still pretty small ideas"
9. **Layer validation** - Ideas that pass initial tests get more investment and more testing
10. **Ship after 10+ layers** - Major features go through many rounds before release

## The Progression

```
Idea → Small Prototype → 20 User Tests
                ↓
        Dies (most ideas)
        OR
        ↓
    Build More → Another Round → Deaths OR More Building
                ↓
        10+ Validation Layers
                ↓
            Ship
```

## When to Use It

- **Early-stage exploration** - Validate ideas before committing engineering time
- **Vibe-coded apps** - Especially valuable now that AI lowers prototyping costs
- **Feature prioritization** - Test concepts before they hit the roadmap
- **Landing page optimization** - Rapid iteration on messaging and positioning
- **Onboarding improvements** - Where first impressions matter most

## The Power User Layer

For more mature products, add another testing layer:

**Gammaster Program Model:**
- Create a Slack workspace for power users
- Share very early prototypes (wireframes, functional mockups)
- Get feedback from users who already understand your product
- Better for features beyond initial onboarding

## Common Mistakes

**Testing too late**
"We spent four months working on this thing. Let's see if anybody actually wants it."

**Testing with friends**
"Your friends want to do you a favor, so they're going to try the product. They're also going to lie to you."

**Making it heavyweight**
User research shouldn't require a dedicated research team for every test

**Not watching the struggle**
Reading feedback summaries is not the same as watching users struggle in real-time
