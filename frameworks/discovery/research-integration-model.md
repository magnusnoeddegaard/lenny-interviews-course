# Research Integration Model

> "My metric for success is when they won't have that meeting without you. That means you've developed influence, strong, trusting relationships, you're an active participant in the process, not just somebody who provides input into someone else's process." - Judd Antin

## What It Is

The Research Integration Model is an organizational approach where researchers are embedded as full partners throughout the product development process, rather than operating as a service function that gets "called in" for specific studies. The key metric for success: the team won't have important meetings without the researcher present.

When research operates as a service function (reactive, project-based, disconnected), it falls into a vicious cycle: researchers do less impactful work, which makes them seem less valuable, which leads to further marginalization. Integration breaks this cycle.

## How It Works

### The Broken Model (Service Function)
- Researchers have their own separate OKRs
- They're brought in at the end to "validate" decisions
- Relationships are transactional (request → study → report)
- Researchers don't participate in strategy discussions
- They're spread thin across many teams
- Work is reactive to what gets requested

### The Integrated Model
- Researchers share the same OKRs as their product teams
- They're present from beginning to end of product processes
- Relationships are deep partnerships built over time
- Researchers participate in all key decision meetings
- They're paired with specific PMs and designers
- Work is proactive, shaped by the researcher's judgment

### The Vicious Cycle to Break
1. Companies hire researchers with good intentions
2. They position them as a service function
3. Researchers end up doing reactive, lower-impact work
4. Executives conclude research isn't impactful
5. Research gets further sidelined or cut
6. Return to step 3

## How to Apply It

### For Companies/Leaders
1. **Unify OKRs** - PMs, engineers, designers, and researchers should share the same success metrics. Either you're doing it together or you're not.

2. **Create researcher-PM pairings** - Assign researchers to specific product areas with consistent partners, not to a pool that fields requests.

3. **Include researchers in everything** - Strategy meetings, planning sessions, post-mortems. If they're not there, insights are missing.

4. **Protect researcher capacity** - A full plate is 2 big projects + 1 small side project. Spreading researchers across 10 projects means all work is mediocre.

### For Researchers
1. **Build relationships proactively** - Don't wait to be invited. Show up to meetings, build trust, become indispensable.

2. **Speak the language of business** - Read quarterly reports, understand the metrics, learn the funnel. Insights framed in business terms get heard.

3. **Push back on the queue** - Don't accept being a service desk. Advocate for partnership models. Say no to low-impact requests.

4. **Be in the room** - A researcher present in discussions can identify the right question in real-time and answer it quickly. That's impossible when working reactively.

### For PMs
1. **Include your researcher from day one** - They should hear the early conversations, not just the formed ideas.

2. **Prioritize together** - Work with your researcher on what research to do, not just what research to request.

3. **Take them to the field** - Travel together, do customer visits together. Build shared context.

4. **Create pain for others** - If you have a great research partnership and others want it, that's how the research team grows.

## When to Use It

- When structuring a research team within a company
- When research feels undervalued or marginalized
- When researchers are spread too thin
- When research consistently arrives too late to matter

## The Integration Test

Answer honestly:
- Does your researcher have the same OKRs as the product team?
- Are they in strategy meetings?
- Would the team postpone a key decision meeting if the researcher couldn't attend?
- Do they know the business metrics as well as the PM?

If the answers are mostly no, you have a service function, not integration.
