# Dog Food and Cat Food

> "Empathize comes very easily if you dog food and then cat food. Dog food meaning using your own product - absolutely a must. Cat food - using your competitors or other people in the landscape's products." - Ebi Atawodi

## What It Is

A dual practice for PMs to build empathy and product intuition. "Dog fooding" (eating your own dog food) means using your product as a real user would. "Cat fooding" extends this to systematically using competitor and adjacent products to understand the broader landscape.

The practice builds the product sense that distinguishes great PMs - the intuition that comes from deep exposure to how products work.

## How It Works

### Dog Fooding

Use your own product as if you were a real user, not an insider:

**Create Fresh Accounts**: Don't just use your employee account. Create new accounts to experience onboarding, first-use flows, and the new user journey.

**Use Multiple Personas**: Ebi maintains "multiple variations of accounts on YouTube" to see how the product manifests for different user types.

**Go Through Key Flows**: Even if you're not the onboarding PM, go through the onboarding flow. Experience what users experience.

**Use It Daily**: If possible, make the product part of your daily life. Understand both the delight and the friction.

### Cat Fooding

Systematically use competitor and adjacent products:

**Direct Competitors**: Use the products you're competing against. At Uber, this meant using other ride-sharing and payment apps.

**Adjacent Products**: Look at products solving similar problems in different categories. What do you love about Spotify's discovery? What makes Stripe's onboarding smooth?

**Best-in-Class Examples**: Every time you pick up your phone, notice what you love about your favorite apps. Articulate why.

## How to Apply It

### Weekly Dog Fooding Practice

1. **Set up test accounts** - Create 2-3 accounts with different personas
2. **Schedule regular sessions** - Block 30 minutes weekly to use your product fresh
3. **Document friction** - Keep notes on what's confusing, slow, or broken
4. **Try edge cases** - What happens when things go wrong?
5. **Compare to memory** - Is the experience better or worse than last month?

### Monthly Cat Fooding Practice

1. **Maintain competitor accounts** - Keep active accounts on 3-5 competitor products
2. **Try new features** - When competitors launch, try it yourself
3. **Note what you love** - What are they doing better than you?
4. **Analyze patterns** - What conventions are emerging across the industry?
5. **Share learnings** - Bring insights to your team

### Building Product Intuition

The goal isn't just to find bugs or feature gaps. It's to build intuition:

> "Your researcher, if you think about the product cycle, research is ahead. But you're a human. Look at the products. Would you use that? You've built some intuition from just exposing yourself to really good products."

Ask yourself:
- What is it about this app that I love?
- Why did that interaction feel delightful?
- What would I do differently?

## When to Use It

- Continuously - this should be an ongoing practice, not a one-time exercise
- Before creating "Top 10 Things You Should Know" documents
- During the empathize phase of vision development
- When preparing for competitive discussions
- When onboarding to a new product or company
- Before making major product decisions

## The Product Sense Connection

This practice connects directly to one of the four pillars of PM skills:

> "When you think about the qualities of a product manager - product sense, leadership, execution promise, and technical ability - it's not product logic. It's product sense. It's a feeling. It's a sense of what is right, and the exposure to products and the curiosity will refine that sense over time."

Dog fooding and cat fooding are how you refine that sense.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Only using your employee account** - You miss the new user experience
2. **Skipping competitor products** - "I don't have time" means you don't understand the landscape
3. **Not documenting** - Insights fade if you don't capture them
4. **Treating it as optional** - This is core PM work, not extra credit
5. **Not sharing learnings** - Your insights should inform the whole team
