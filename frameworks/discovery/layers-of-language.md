# Layers of Language

> "In the first five minutes of an interview, they're going to tell you, 'I bought a new car because I got a deal on it and it was a car I've been dreaming about forever...' when you start to get to it, no, the old car had 280,000 miles on it." - Bob Moesta

## What It Is

Layers of Language is an interviewing framework that recognizes customer responses come in distinct layers—from surface-level platitudes to exaggerated extremes to actual truth. Developed by Bob Moesta as part of the Jobs to Be Done methodology, it helps interviewers move past what people say to discover what actually happened.

The key insight is that customers aren't lying—they're communicating in predictable patterns. Understanding these layers helps you dig deeper without dismissing early responses.

## How It Works

### Layer 1: Pablum
The first, automatic response. These are socially safe, generic answers that don't actually convey meaning.

**Characteristics:**
- Short, socially expected responses
- Vague and non-committal
- Reveals nothing about actual behavior

**Examples:**
- "How was your day?" → "Oh, it was good"
- "Why did you buy this?" → "It was a great deal"
- "How do you like the product?" → "It's fine, works well"

**What to do:** Don't accept it. Ask one follow-up question to go deeper.

> "If you ask one further question, 'Well, what was good about it?' They're like, 'Ugh.'"

### Layer 2: Fantasy/Nightmare
When pushed past pablum, people often swing to extremes—either idealized versions of reality or catastrophized fears.

**Characteristics:**
- Exaggerated in one direction
- Emotionally charged
- Often reveals what they wish were true or fear might be true

**Examples:**
- "It was SO good because of this amazing feature" (fantasy)
- "Oh my God, it was SO bad because they totally dropped the ball" (nightmare)
- "I've been dreaming about this car forever" (fantasy)

**What to do:** Recognize this as a layer, not truth. Use it as a direction to explore, then pull back to reality.

### Layer 3: Reality
What actually happened—the specific events, trade-offs, and circumstances that drove behavior.

**Characteristics:**
- Specific and concrete
- Contains trade-offs and contradictions
- Often less dramatic than fantasy/nightmare
- Reveals the real causal mechanisms

**Examples:**
- "Actually, the old car had 280,000 miles, three big repair bills in the last four months, and there's a long trip coming up"
- "I bought it because the demo showed it could handle our specific workflow, even though it was more expensive"

## How to Apply It

### 1. Expect and Navigate Each Layer

Don't be frustrated by pablum or misled by fantasy/nightmare. They're predictable stages:

```
Customer speaks → Pablum → Push gently → Fantasy/Nightmare → Pull back to specifics → Reality
```

### 2. Use Specific Techniques to Go Deeper

**"Tell me more about that"** - Simple but effective

**"Give me an example"** - Forces specificity

**Bracketing at the edge of language**: When they run out of words, offer two incorrect options:
> "So was it more about X or more about Y?" (knowing it's neither)

This forces them to articulate what they actually mean.

**Play it back incorrectly**: Deliberately summarize wrong to get correction:
> "So you did this and this and this and this..."
> "No, that wasn't it."

The correction reveals more than the original would have.

### 3. Follow the Contradiction

When something seems irrational, you've found something valuable:

> "The moment you hear a story and you go, 'I can't believe that,' nine times out of 10 it's because you don't have the rest of the story."

Don't dismiss it as an anomaly—dig deeper for the context that makes it make sense.

### 4. Get to "No"

From Chris Voss's interrogation techniques: "The moment somebody says yes, there's nothing more to say."

When you get a "no," they'll elaborate. Play back incorrect summaries intentionally to generate more detail.

### 5. Reconstruct Timeline

The reality layer often includes temporal distortions:

> "I did an interview with somebody who bought a coat rack, $137 coat rack. It took them 18 months to buy it. And in their mind, they say they bought it in a week."

Ask about specific events to reconstruct the actual timeline.

## Interview Flow Example

**Pablum:**
Q: "Why did you switch to our product?"
A: "It seemed like a better fit."

**Push to Fantasy/Nightmare:**
Q: "What made it seem like a better fit?"
A: "The old one was SO frustrating—nothing ever worked right!"

**Pull to Reality:**
Q: "Give me an example of something that didn't work. Tell me about the last time that happened."
A: "Well, last month we had this report due, and the system crashed twice. My boss was waiting, and I had to manually pull data from three different places. It took four hours instead of thirty minutes."

Now you have real information.

## When to Use It

- **Customer interviews**: Expect and navigate through layers
- **User research**: Get past stated preferences to actual behavior
- **Sales conversations**: Understand real objections vs. surface concerns
- **Churn analysis**: Find the actual reasons, not the stated ones
- **Product feedback**: Dig past "it's fine" to real issues

## Common Mistakes

1. **Accepting pablum** - The first answer is rarely the real answer
2. **Believing fantasy** - Exaggeration reveals direction, not truth
3. **Dismissing "irrational" responses** - They contain the most insight
4. **Asking "why" directly** - Often produces rationalizations, not causes
5. **Trusting timeline recall** - Always verify with specific events
