# Three Sources of Energy (Functional, Emotional, Social)

> "There's three levels of information we have to get or three sources of energy... there's got to be energy in the system for us to do something." - Bob Moesta

## What It Is

The Three Sources of Energy framework identifies the three types of motivation that drive customer decisions: functional, emotional, and social. Developed by Bob Moesta as part of the Jobs to Be Done methodology, it recognizes that purchases are rarely purely rational—there must be sufficient energy across all three dimensions for behavior change to occur.

Understanding all three sources helps you identify the full picture of why people make decisions and what will actually drive them to act.

## How It Works

### 1. Functional Energy
The practical, tangible aspects of a decision. These are usually the easiest to articulate and measure.

**Components:**
- Time (How much time will this save/cost?)
- Space (Does this fit my physical constraints?)
- Effort (How hard is this to implement/use?)
- Knowledge (Do I understand how to do this?)
- Money (What are the financial implications?)

**Example**: "I need software that processes orders in under 2 seconds and integrates with our existing inventory system."

### 2. Emotional Energy
How the person feels—their internal psychological state. These are often the real drivers but harder for people to articulate.

**Common emotional states:**
- Frustrated ("I'm sick of dealing with this")
- Anxious ("I'm worried about what might happen")
- Hopeful ("I want to feel better about this")
- Overlooked ("Nobody sees the work I'm putting in")
- Inadequate ("I'm not measuring up")
- Excited ("This could change everything")

**Example**: "I feel overwhelmed and behind—I want to feel like I'm finally in control."

### 3. Social Energy
How others perceive us or how we want to be perceived. This external dimension often interacts with emotional energy.

**Dimensions:**
- How I want others to see me
- How others actually perceive me
- Status and respect considerations
- Fitting in vs. standing out
- Meeting others' expectations

**Example**: "My boss thinks I'm not moving fast enough and I feel inadequate."

## The Interaction Pattern

These three sources interact and amplify each other:

> "My boss is going to fire me because he doesn't think I'm doing this fast enough [social] and I feel inadequate [emotional]."

In this example:
- **Functional**: Need to work faster
- **Emotional**: Feeling inadequate
- **Social**: Boss's perception/expectations

The social pressure creates emotional distress, which creates urgency around the functional need.

## How to Apply It

### 1. Interview Across All Three Dimensions

When talking to customers, probe each energy source:

**Functional questions:**
- "Walk me through how you're doing this today"
- "How much time does this take?"
- "What tools or resources do you need?"

**Emotional questions:**
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What were you worried about?"
- "What were you hoping would happen?"

**Social questions:**
- "What did others think about this?"
- "How did this affect how people saw you?"
- "Who else was involved in this decision?"

### 2. Don't Stop at Functional

Most customer research stops at functional needs because they're easiest to discuss. But emotional and social factors often determine whether someone actually acts.

**Example - The Money Trap**:
> "Why do you need more money?"
> "I want more money because I want more respect."

Money is the stated functional need, but the real driver is social (respect). Address only the functional, and you miss the real motivation.

### 3. Map Your Product's Energy Impact

For your product or feature, identify:

| Energy Type | What problem does it solve? | What feeling does it create? |
|-------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Functional | Saves 2 hours/week | - |
| Emotional | - | Relief from anxiety |
| Social | - | Looks competent to team |

Products that address all three sources have stronger pull.

### 4. Position for the Real Energy

Don't just market functional benefits. Connect to emotional and social motivations:

**Weak (functional only)**: "Save 2 hours a week on reporting"

**Stronger (all three)**: "Stop scrambling before board meetings. Walk in confident with numbers you trust—and look like the professional you are."

## When to Use It

- **Customer interviews**: Ensure you're uncovering complete motivations
- **Product positioning**: Connect features to emotional/social outcomes
- **Sales conversations**: Discover what's really driving the decision
- **Persona development**: Build three-dimensional customer profiles
- **Pricing**: Understand what people are really paying for

## Common Mistakes

1. **Stopping at functional** - The easiest answers aren't always the real drivers
2. **Ignoring social context** - Decisions often involve other people's perceptions
3. **Treating emotions as irrational** - They're real data, not noise
4. **Not unpacking surface answers** - "I need more money" requires follow-up questions
