# No Asshole Filter

> "One of the top things I always hear about DoorDash from an executive standpoint when we do the internal survey is it's a 'no politics, no asshole' culture... the fact we were willing to go all the way down the path and have someone super qualified but didn't meet the culture bar, for him was what pushed him over the edge to join the company." - Keith Yandell

## What It Is

A hiring principle where cultural fit is a hard requirement, not a tiebreaker. No matter how qualified a candidate is, if they display behaviors inconsistent with a healthy team culture—arrogance, political behavior, lack of humility—they don't get hired. Period.

The counterintuitive insight: maintaining this standard actually attracts better talent. Strong performers want to work in environments free from politics and toxicity. Being willing to reject highly qualified candidates for cultural reasons signals to the best candidates that you're serious about maintaining that environment.

## How It Works

### The Ryan Sokol Story

Keith interviewed Ryan Sokol, now VP of Engineering at DoorDash. Ryan came across as aloof and curt during the interview. Despite being highly qualified, Keith went to CEO Tony Xu and said, "I think this guy's a jerk. I don't think we want him at the company."

Tony's response: "I want you to just have dinner with him, please, because I got a completely different impression. And if you have dinner with him, and you still think he's a jerk, we won't hire."

At dinner, Keith opened directly: "Ryan, during the interview you kind of seemed like an asshole. Are you an asshole?"

Ryan's response—embarrassment, curiosity about what he'd done wrong, genuine desire to understand—completely changed Keith's impression. They stayed late, had beers, and became good friends.

Six months later, Ryan told Keith that DoorDash's willingness to potentially reject him for attitude issues was what convinced him to join. He knew the company was serious about culture.

### The Test

When you give tough, direct feedback about a culture concern:
- **Bad sign**: Defensiveness, dismissal, "that's just how I am"
- **Good sign**: Curiosity, embarrassment, genuine desire to understand and improve

## How to Apply It

1. **Name it explicitly** - Make "no politics, no asshole" an articulated cultural principle, not just an implicit hope.

2. **Be willing to walk away** - The principle only works if you actually reject qualified candidates who fail the culture check. One exception destroys credibility.

3. **Address concerns directly** - If something feels off but you otherwise like a candidate, name it directly. "You came across as X during the interview. Tell me about that."

4. **Watch how they respond** - The response to direct feedback is the real test, not the initial behavior.

5. **Get a second opinion** - Tony's instinct differed from Keith's. Have multiple perspectives on culture fit.

6. **Use cultural expectations as a recruiting tool** - Be explicit during interviews about what's expected. This attracts aligned candidates and repels misaligned ones.

## When to Use It

- **Every hire** - This isn't reserved for senior roles; toxicity at any level damages culture
- **Borderline candidates** - When someone has the skills but something feels off
- **High performers** - Especially important; brilliant jerks do outsized damage
- **Candidate's final decision** - Candidates evaluating whether to join want to know you're serious
- **Performance management** - The principle doesn't stop at hiring; it applies to existing team members

## The Paradox

Maintaining strict cultural standards attracts better talent because:
- Top performers want to work with other top performers who aren't jerks
- It signals leadership is serious, not just aspirational
- It reduces future management burden (no brilliant jerks to manage around)
- It creates psychological safety that enables better work
