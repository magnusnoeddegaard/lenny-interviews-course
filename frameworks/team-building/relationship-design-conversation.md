# Relationship Design Conversation

> "Have a relationship design conversation with each of them when they're first hired. Because I think a lot of us come in naive, assuming, 'I'm just going to come in and do my thing the way I've always done it. It's going to be fine.' Versus coming in and saying, 'I actually don't know how I'm going to operate at this company.'" - Kenneth Berger

## What It Is

A Relationship Design Conversation is an intentional discussion with new team members about how you'll work together effectively, rather than leaving working dynamics to chance or assumption. The insight comes from Kenneth Berger's painful experience at Slack, where neither he nor the CEO explicitly discussed expectations—leading to a year of suffering and three firings.

The framework recognizes that everyone has range in how they work, and the best approach for one context may not fit another. Without intentional design, people default to what worked before, which often creates friction with new teams, cultures, and leaders.

## How It Works

The conversation isn't about performance management or catching problems—it's a collaborative design session to figure out:

1. **What does success look like here?** Not the job description, but the actual metrics and outcomes that matter
2. **Who else is involved?** Understanding the team, culture, and how decisions get made
3. **What's my role and place?** How you fit with other people and functions
4. **How should we communicate?** Frequency, format, escalation paths
5. **What do we each need from this relationship?** Explicit expectations from both sides

## How to Apply It

### For Leaders/Founders

**When to have the conversation:** Within the first week or two of a new hire starting, especially for your first 10-15 employees where relationships are most formative.

**Key questions to cover:**
- "What does success look like for you in this role?"
- "How do you prefer to receive feedback—in the moment or scheduled?"
- "What kind of relationship do you want with me as your manager/founder?"
- "What's your experience with [key skill/context]? Where might you need support?"
- "What signals should I look for that things aren't working?"

### For New Employees

**What to ask:**
- "What does success look like in the first 90 days?"
- "How does this team/company make decisions?"
- "What's the culture here around disagreement and debate?"
- "How should I earn trust with you and the team?"
- "What's worked well for people in this role before? What hasn't?"

**Mindset shift:** Enter with curiosity rather than confidence. Assume you don't know how to operate at this company yet, even if you're experienced.

## The First PM at Startup Case

Kenneth Berger's specific advice for first PMs (or any high-stakes first hire):

1. **Understand the CEO/founder's state**: Imagine they're terrified all the time. This helps explain otherwise confusing behavior and sets realistic expectations.

2. **Invest in the relationship first**: You won't succeed in any meaningful way without a healthy relationship with the person you're working for.

3. **Don't assume your experience transfers**: What worked at your last company—even if it was successful—may not fit here.

## When to Use It

- First 10-15 hires at a startup
- Joining as a senior leader or executive
- When reporting relationships change (new manager, new structure)
- After a significant team reorganization
- Whenever you sense a disconnect between expectations and reality

## What It Prevents

- Assumptions that lead to misalignment
- Year-long suffering from unexpressed expectations (like Kenneth's Slack experience)
- The "I'll just do my thing" trap that ignores cultural context
- Fear-based avoidance of difficult but necessary conversations
