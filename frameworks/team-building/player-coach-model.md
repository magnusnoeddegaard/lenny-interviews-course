# Player Coach Model

> "All of our people leaders are player coaches in that they still do the end work themselves and they can mentor and coach those around them." - Grant Lee

## What It Is

The Player Coach Model eliminates pure management layers. Every leader at the company continues to do hands-on work while also mentoring and coaching their teams. There are no managers whose only job is to manage.

Grant Lee draws the analogy from sports: in football, a coach calls plays from the sideline, but the quarterback on the field can make last-minute adjustments based on what he sees the defense doing. Player coaches are on the field—they see what's actually happening and can adapt in real-time without waiting for direction.

This creates organizations that are flatter, faster, and where leadership remains grounded in the actual work.

## How It Works

**1. Close to the Work**
Player coaches understand the real complexity because they're doing the work. This prevents the abstraction and drift that happens when managers only hear about work secondhand.

**2. Real-Time Adjustment**
Like a quarterback reading the defense, player coaches can adjust priorities for their team on a daily or weekly basis without escalation. They're so close to the work that they understand relative prioritization at all times.

**3. Credibility and Mentorship**
When you're still doing the work, your coaching carries weight. You can teach from experience, not theory.

**4. Natural Organizational Flatness**
If leaders are also doing work, you need fewer of them. Teams stay small and hierarchies stay flat.

## How to Apply It

### Defining Player Coach Roles

1. **50%+ IC work** - Player coaches should spend meaningful time on individual contributor work, not just meetings
2. **Scope appropriately** - Smaller teams per leader (since they're also doing work)
3. **Hire for both skills** - People who are excellent at the work AND can mentor others

### Making It Work

4. **Protect IC time** - Shield player coaches from meeting creep
5. **Align metrics** - Judge leaders partly on their own output, not just team output
6. **Avoid the trap of "just managing"** - Check that leaders are actually doing work, not just coordinating

### Pairing with Generalists

7. **Hire generalists** - People who can wear multiple hats naturally work better with player coaches
8. **Cross-functional projects** - Let teams tackle problems end-to-end without handoffs
9. **Flatten by default** - Question every management layer addition

## The Sports Analogy

**Traditional Management (Coach on Sideline):**
- Calls plays from a distance
- Has to wait for reports from the field
- Makes decisions based on delayed information
- Can't see the details of execution

**Player Coach (Quarterback):**
- Gets the general intent from coaching staff
- Makes real-time adjustments based on what's actually happening
- Sees details invisible from the sideline
- Can execute the play, not just direct it

## When It Works Best

- **Small to medium teams** - Natural fit for companies under ~100 people
- **Fast-moving domains** - Where the work changes quickly and abstracted management lags
- **High-context work** - Where understanding nuance matters for good decisions
- **Generalist cultures** - Where people are already wearing multiple hats

## When It Gets Harder

Grant acknowledges this may evolve: "That's where we are at today. I think being adaptable means that certain things may evolve and change and how the player coach model evolves and maybe in certain functions or as the team scales, that's not going to be practical everywhere."

Consider adaptation when:
- Teams grow beyond what one player coach can handle while doing work
- Specialized functions require dedicated management (compliance, large sales orgs)
- Coordination costs begin to outweigh IC time

## Org Design Innovation

> "Every founder today has a chance to innovate on org design, and that starts by just thinking about what is the type of company we want to build today."

The Player Coach Model represents a conscious choice to build a different kind of organization—one that prioritizes:
- Speed over scale
- Context over coordination
- Ownership over hierarchy
- Impact over headcount
