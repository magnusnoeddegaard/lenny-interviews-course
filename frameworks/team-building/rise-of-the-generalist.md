# Rise of the Generalist

> "This very much feels like the age of the generalist or the rise of the generalist right now... A product designer that knows how to code, that's great. It allows you to actually span across many different domains." - Grant Lee

## What It Is

The Rise of the Generalist is the observation that modern companies—especially AI-era startups—benefit more from versatile people than specialists. Generalists can wear multiple hats, adapt to changing needs, and operate in flat organizations where scope isn't narrowly defined.

The key insight: specialization can be augmented through contractors, agencies, and AI tools, but versatility and judgment cannot. A designer who codes, a marketer who manages influencers AND runs drone shows, a PM who does research AND data analysis—these people compound their impact in ways specialists cannot.

Grant Lee notes that more than a quarter of Gamma's team are product designers, and many of them also code. This unconventional investment in versatile design/engineering hybrids has been central to their ability to ship novel AI experiences.

## How It Works

**1. Flat Organizations Require Flexibility**
When an organization is truly flat, people can't hide in narrow scope. Everyone needs to "wear a lot of different hats" by default.

**2. Generalists Pick Up What's Needed**
When work expands or shifts, generalists can "go after and pick up a piece of work because it's there and they can at least get it started."

**3. Specialization is Outsourceable**
For hyper-specialized work (influencer marketing operations, specific legal expertise), agencies and contractors fill the gap while core team stays generalist.

**4. AI Amplifies Generalists**
AI tools let generalists perform at near-specialist level in many domains—writing code, creating content, analyzing data—making versatility even more valuable.

## How to Apply It

### Hiring for Generalism

1. **Look for range** - "Spiky" skills in multiple areas are better than deep in one
2. **Hire designers who code** - The hybrid designer/developer is the prototype
3. **Value context switching** - People who thrive moving between domains, not those who resist it
4. **Check for curiosity** - Generalists are usually naturally curious learners

### Structuring Work

5. **Avoid narrow job descriptions** - Scope roles broadly rather than specifically
6. **Let people pick up adjacent work** - Encourage crossing traditional boundaries
7. **Don't punish breadth** - Career paths shouldn't require deepening specialization

### Augmenting with Specialists

8. **Use agencies for hyper-specialized needs** - Influencer operations, specific technical expertise
9. **Contractors for surge capacity** - When you need deep expertise temporarily
10. **AI tools for skill extension** - Let generalists access specialist capabilities through AI

## Examples at Gamma

- **Designers who code** - More than a quarter of the team, able to prototype and ship
- **Head of Marketing** - Managed entire marketing team while also leading a drone show project end-to-end
- **Everyone** - Works across domains rather than staying in narrow lanes

## The AI Era Amplification

AI tools dramatically expand what a generalist can do:
- **Code**: Generalists can write and debug code with AI assistance
- **Design**: Non-designers can create visual assets
- **Analysis**: Anyone can query and analyze data
- **Writing**: Content creation is accessible to non-writers

This makes the judgment and taste that generalists bring even more valuable—AI provides the skills, humans provide the direction.

## When to Still Hire Specialists

- **Regulated domains** - Legal, compliance, security often need specialists
- **Deep technical needs** - Cutting-edge ML, specialized infrastructure
- **Scale requirements** - Very large sales teams, support organizations

But even here, the answer is often to hire one specialist and surround them with generalists, not to build entire specialist organizations.

## Org Design Implications

If you're building a generalist organization:
- Teams stay smaller (each person does more)
- Hierarchy stays flatter (fewer coordination roles needed)
- Agencies and contractors fill specialist gaps
- Job titles matter less than capabilities
