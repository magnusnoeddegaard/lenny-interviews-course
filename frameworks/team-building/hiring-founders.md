# Hiring Founders

> "I had this belief that sort of these people that I had seen, many of whom have now gone on to start companies that are doing quite well, would be incredible value add. Like basically, it's kind of like, if you could just hold onto a rock for a little bit it can take you pretty far." - Ayo Omojola

## What It Is

Hiring Founders is a deliberate team-building strategy of actively recruiting former founders—including those whose startups failed—into product and leadership roles. Traditional hiring pipelines filter out non-traditional candidates, but former founders bring unique qualities: high output, first-principles thinking, and an ability to cut through organizational friction.

Ayo observed that many brilliant founders he knew would "bounce off organizations"—they'd join Amazon or another big company and just not last. Yet these same people went on to start successful companies. The insight was that standard hiring algorithms screened them out before hiring managers ever saw them.

The framework acknowledges explicit trade-offs: founders bring differentially higher output but also higher attrition (typically 2-2.5 years before they leave to pursue their own ventures).

## How It Works

**The Traditional Hiring Problem:**
By the time resumes reach hiring managers, sourcers have already filtered for conventional backgrounds (FAANG companies, certain schools, specific experience types). Non-traditional candidates like former founders are invisible.

**The Founder Hiring Approach:**
1. Explicitly state in job postings: "If you've been a founder before, even if your startup has failed, please apply"
2. Actively source from founder networks and failed startup alumni
3. Work around traditional recruiting filters that screen out non-standard profiles

**The Trade-offs:**
- **Pro**: Differentially higher output
- **Pro**: Cut through bullshit instantly—they see organizational waste immediately
- **Pro**: Level up the whole team—people in founder-dense teams love it
- **Con**: Higher attrition (2-2.5 year tenure typical)
- **Con**: They call out everything you're doing wrong (requires thick skin)
- **Con**: Ambitious people eventually leave to start their own things

## How to Apply It

1. **Change your job postings** - Explicitly invite founders to apply, including those with failed startups. Address the imposter syndrome that often comes with the chip-on-shoulder founder mentality.

2. **Work around the algorithm** - Don't let standard sourcing filters eliminate non-traditional candidates. Review resumes before they go through standard screening.

3. **Prepare for candor** - Founders will immediately identify and call out organizational waste and inefficiency. View this as valuable feedback, not criticism.

4. **Plan for tenure** - Budget for 2-2.5 year engagements. Extract maximum value during that window and maintain relationships for future collaboration.

5. **Spread across functions** - Don't limit to product—founders can bring value in engineering, marketing, operations, and other functions.

6. **Accept the math** - You're trading higher turnover for higher output. If that trade-off doesn't work for your organization, this isn't the right approach.

## When to Use It

- **Building high-performance teams**: When output matters more than stability
- **Startup environments**: Where founder mentality aligns with company culture
- **Turnaround situations**: When you need people who will identify and fix problems quickly
- **Innovation teams**: Where first-principles thinking is valuable
- **Regulated industries**: Former founders often excel at navigating complexity (as Ayo found at Cash App and Carbon Health)
