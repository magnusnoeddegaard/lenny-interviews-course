# Seniority Gap

> "The seniority gap is really rough where you need to have enough experienced people in the company who can then train your high potential people... Your high potential people also lose out if they don't have experienced people learning from." - Drew Houston

## What It Is

The seniority gap is a dangerous talent imbalance that accumulates in fast-growing companies when the ratio between experienced leaders and high-potential but inexperienced employees becomes skewed. This typically happens when a company's narrative turns negative, causing experienced talent to leave for shinier opportunities while the company backfills with battlefield promotions.

The problem compounds: when talented people can easily join "the next Facebook, not MySpace," retention drops. Companies respond by promoting internally - which seems good for those employees in the short term. But suddenly people are solving problems through trial and error that aren't new to the industry - just new to them. Unknown unknowns proliferate.

Drew Houston experienced this acutely at Dropbox during the late 2010s tech talent wars, where experienced executives had multiple offers for 3x compensation and one-third the workload.

## How It Works

The seniority gap emerges through a predictable cycle:

**1. Talent Flywheel Reversal**
- Company narrative turns negative (press, market position)
- Experienced people leave for opportunities elsewhere
- Recruiting experienced replacements becomes extremely difficult

**2. Compensation Pressure Creates Distortion**
- To hire anyone, you offer inflated titles ("double promotions")
- Directors become VPs, VPs become SVPs just to get offers accepted
- Title inflation masks experience gaps

**3. Learning Rate Collapse**
- High-potential people now lack mentors
- Problems get solved through trial and error instead of pattern recognition
- Organizational learning rate drops below what the company needs

**4. Self-Reinforcing Decline**
- Slower execution and more mistakes
- Further narrative deterioration
- More experienced people leave

## How to Apply It

1. **Monitor the ratio** - Track the balance of "been there, done that" leaders vs. "doing it for the first time" talent. Aim for roughly 40-60% or 50-50.

2. **Don't over-correct either way** - All experienced hires means too much outside DNA spliced into your organism. All high-potential means no one to learn from.

3. **Resist battlefield promotions** - When someone leaves, the answer isn't always promoting from within. Sometimes you need to hire experience even if it's harder.

4. **Watch for title inflation** - If you're giving double promotions just to get offers accepted, you're building a seniority gap.

5. **Create learning structures** - Pair high-potential people with experienced mentors explicitly. Don't assume osmosis will work.

6. **Address narrative proactively** - The seniority gap often starts with a narrative problem. Fix the story before the talent bleeds.

## When to Use It

- When experiencing unexpected attrition of senior leaders
- When you notice problems being solved through trial and error that have known solutions
- When hiring experienced candidates has become extremely difficult
- When you've done multiple rounds of "battlefield promotions"
- When your company's narrative in the press has turned negative
