# Raw Intellect Over Experience

> "Revolut values way more raw intellect and this unquenched hunger to build things rather than experience." - Dmitry Zlokazov

## What It Is

Raw Intellect Over Experience is a hiring philosophy that prioritizes intelligence, drive, and passion for building over years of industry experience. The framework argues that in product roles, experienced hires often take just as long to ramp up while bringing less hunger to change the status quo.

The insight comes from observing that domain expertise doesn't transfer as cleanly as expected. Even seasoned product managers need months to understand new product intricacies, customer contexts, and company culture. Meanwhile, experienced hires often come with inflated expectations, higher compensation, and a tendency to rest on past achievements rather than attacking problems fresh.

By hiring earlier-career people with exceptional raw potential and intense drive, companies can get similar ramp times with more ambition, adaptability, and long-term growth potential.

## How It Works

**The Case Against Experience:**
- Product ramp-up is inherently long—domain expertise doesn't shortcut it much
- Experienced hires often lack urgency to change status quo (requires "toil, tears, and sweat")
- Higher compensation creates inflated expectations without proportional performance
- Past success at established companies doesn't predict success in fast-moving environments
- Culture and process adaptation takes time regardless of experience

**What to Hire For Instead:**
1. **Raw intellect** - Problem-solving ability, mental agility, pattern recognition
2. **Hunger to build** - Demonstrated passion for creating things, not managing things
3. **Hands-on orientation** - Willingness to do the work themselves, not delegate
4. **Adaptability** - Ability to learn quickly and adjust to new contexts
5. **Ownership mindset** - Natural inclination to attack problems without being asked

**Best Candidate Profile:**
- Former technical co-founder of a startup
- Someone who built things with small teams
- Worked across multiple functions out of necessity
- Loves building, not just shipping
- May have less traditional PM experience but high proof of capability

## How to Apply It

1. **Source from great products** - Find people who built products you admire, regardless of their title or years in role

2. **Target hungry builders** - Look for startup experience, side projects, and evidence of creating things from scratch

3. **Interview for intellect and drive** - Test problem-solving and pattern recognition, not domain knowledge recall

4. **Discount pedigree** - Years at famous companies matter less than what someone actually built and owned

5. **Accept longer onboarding** - Budget the same ramp time you would for experienced hires—the difference is in output after ramp

6. **Create growth paths** - Hire people who will outgrow their role quickly and give them room to expand

## When to Use It

**Strong fit:**
- Fast-growing companies where culture matters more than immediate productivity
- Roles where domain expertise is learnable and company-specific
- Organizations that invest in developing talent
- Companies with strong founders who can mentor and develop people
- Markets where fresh perspective creates advantage over industry conventions

**Consider experienced hires when:**
- Regulatory expertise is genuinely required (can't learn compliance on the job)
- The role requires external credibility (investor relations, enterprise sales)
- You need someone to build the function from scratch with no mentorship available
- Speed-to-impact is critical and learning curve is unacceptable
