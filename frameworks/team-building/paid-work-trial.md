# Paid Work Trial

> "We do with all of the employees, we've done a paid work trial... basically they come as a mini contractor to the company, and we give them a very usually fairly vague problem statement. If you're an engineer, it's like, 'hey, there's this feature that needs to be built. How would you build it?' Then go build it." - Karri Saarinen

## What It Is

Paid Work Trial is a hiring practice where the final stage of evaluation is actual compensated work rather than more interviews. Candidates work alongside the team for a defined period, tackling real problems with full access to the codebase, tools, and team.

This approach addresses a fundamental limitation of interviews: they measure performance in artificial conditions, not actual work settings. By having candidates do real work in the real environment, both the company and candidate get authentic information about whether the fit is right.

Linear uses this for all employees as a standard practice, giving candidates vague problem statements and evaluating how they scope, approach, build, and communicate their work.

## How It Works

**The Structure:**

1. **Standard interviews first** - Hiring manager interviews and skill assessments happen as normal

2. **Work trial as final stage** - Instead of more interviews, candidates come on as paid contractors

3. **Real access, real work** - Candidates get access to the codebase, Slack, Notion, and tools. They work on actual problems, not contrived exercises.

4. **Intentionally vague scope** - Problem statements are open-ended, requiring candidates to scope and prioritize themselves

5. **Integration with the team** - Candidates join meetings, have one-on-ones, and experience the actual work environment

6. **Presentation of work** - At the end, candidates present what they built and explain their decisions

**What the company evaluates:**
- How does this person approach ambiguous problems?
- Can they make progress in a short timeframe?
- How do they communicate and collaborate?
- Do they share the company's values and approach?

**What the candidate evaluates:**
- What is it actually like to work here?
- Is the codebase well-maintained?
- Do I enjoy working with these people?
- Does this match what was described in interviews?

## How to Apply It

1. **Design meaningful projects** - Create problem statements that are representative of actual work but achievable in the trial timeframe

2. **Be intentionally vague** - Part of the evaluation is how candidates scope and clarify problems

3. **Compensate fairly** - Pay market rates for the work. This isn't free labor.

4. **Work with candidate schedules** - Trials might happen on weekends, during PTO, or between jobs. Be flexible.

5. **Provide full access** - Don't create a sanitized sandbox. Let candidates see the real environment.

6. **Create integration opportunities** - Set up one-on-ones with team members, invite them to relevant meetings

7. **Evaluate holistically** - Look at problem-solving approach, communication, collaboration, and code quality

**Duration considerations:**
- Length varies by role—could be a day, several days, or a week
- Should be long enough to see real work but not so long it's burdensome

## When to Use It

**Works well when:**
- You're hiring for roles where work output is visible (engineering, design)
- Company culture and work style are important to evaluate
- You want to reduce hiring mistakes (false positives are costly)
- You have a distinctive way of working that's hard to assess in interviews
- Candidates would benefit from seeing the reality before committing

**Challenges to address:**
- Candidates with current jobs may have scheduling constraints
- Some candidates may decline (Linear reports this is rare)
- Requires team capacity to support the trial
- Not all roles have easily scoped trial projects

**Linear's experience:**
Karri notes that very few candidates have declined the work trial. Most value the opportunity to evaluate the company as much as the company evaluates them. After completing the trial, candidates have a much clearer sense of what they're signing up for.
