# Generalist Product Teams

> "Doing a bit of everything. Being a generalist is I think much more important than it used to be. And if I'm putting together a product team today, I would re-obsess about getting as many skill sets as possible for each person I hire. They should know how architecting a system works, preferably they should know design, they should have product taste, they should know how to talk to users." - Anton Osika

## What It Is

A framework for building product teams in the AI era that prioritizes breadth of skills over depth of specialization. As AI tools increasingly handle specialized execution, the value shifts to people who can navigate across disciplines, see the whole picture, and direct AI effectively.

The traditional model optimized for specialists who go deep in one area. The new model optimizes for generalists who can work across the full product development lifecycle—using AI to amplify their capabilities in each domain.

This shift reflects a fundamental change: when AI can write code, create designs, and analyze data, the human's job becomes knowing what to direct the AI to do, which requires understanding multiple domains.

## How It Works

**Traditional Team Model:**
- Hire specialists: designer, frontend engineer, backend engineer, PM, researcher
- Each person goes deep in their function
- Handoffs between specialists
- Value = depth of expertise

**Generalist Team Model:**
- Hire generalists with multiple capabilities
- Each person can work across the stack
- Fewer handoffs, more ownership
- Value = breadth of skills × AI amplification

**Core Skill Areas for Generalists:**
1. **System Architecture** - Understanding how technical systems work
2. **Design** - Visual design, UX thinking, product aesthetics
3. **Product Taste** - Knowing what good looks like, quality intuition
4. **User Research** - Talking to users, understanding needs
5. **AI Fluency** - Directing AI tools effectively across all domains

The key insight: AI amplifies capability in any domain, so breadth of knowledge becomes more valuable than depth in one area.

## How to Apply It

1. **Redefine your hiring criteria** - Instead of "expert in React," look for "understands frontend AND has product sense AND can talk to users"

2. **Assess for breadth in interviews** - Ask about experiences across domains. Look for curiosity and learning orientation, not just expertise.

3. **Value the T-shape differently** - Still hire people who are exceptional in something, but prioritize how many other things they can do competently.

4. **Structure for ownership** - Give generalists full ownership of problems, not slices of solutions. Let them work across the stack.

5. **Invest in cross-training** - Help specialists develop adjacent skills. The goal is a team where everyone can contribute anywhere.

6. **Hire for AI fluency** - Explicitly evaluate candidates' ability to use AI tools effectively. This amplifies all their other skills.

## When to Use It

- **Early-stage teams** - When you need maximum flexibility with minimal headcount
- **AI-native products** - When you're building in the new paradigm
- **Small, fast-moving teams** - When handoffs are more expensive than breadth
- **Hiring decisions** - When choosing between specialists and generalists
- **Team restructuring** - When adapting existing teams to new realities
