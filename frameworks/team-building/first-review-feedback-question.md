# First Review Feedback Question

> "What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review? It's an amazing question, because the person can't dodge it. There's an answer, and it's incredibly enlightening." - Paul Adams

## What It Is

A reference call technique that cuts through the inherent bias of reference calls by asking a question that forces honest, actionable feedback. Instead of asking vague questions like "What were their weaknesses?" or "What should they work on?", you ask: "What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?"

The question works because:
1. **It's undodgeable** - Everyone has areas for growth; there's always an answer
2. **It's forward-looking** - The reference is helping you manage, not just evaluate
3. **It's specific** - It asks for feedback you'll actually give, not abstract weaknesses
4. **It normalizes growth areas** - Performance reviews always include development feedback

## How It Works

**The Problem with Traditional Reference Questions**:
- Candidates select their best references (favorite managers, strongest advocates)
- Standard weakness questions get deflected or minimized
- References feel protective and give sanitized answers

**Why This Question Works**:
When you ask "What feedback will I be giving this person?", you're:
- Assuming the hire happens and framing the reference as your partner in their success
- Making it a collaborative question rather than an evaluative one
- Creating psychological safety—giving feedback is helpful, listing weaknesses feels disloyal
- Getting specific, actionable insights rather than vague statements

## How to Apply It

1. **Build rapport first** - Have a normal reference conversation before asking this question
2. **Frame it collaboratively** - "I want to set this person up for success..."
3. **Ask the question directly** - "What feedback will I be giving them in their first performance review?"
4. **Listen for specifics** - Good references will give concrete examples and patterns
5. **Follow up** - "How did they respond to feedback on this in the past?"

**Variation questions**:
- "If I hire them, what should I watch for in the first 90 days?"
- "What's the development area they're working on that I should support?"
- "What kind of manager do they thrive under vs. struggle with?"

## When to Use It

- **Reference calls** - After you've decided to extend an offer, validate with this question
- **Late-stage interviews** - Can be adapted for candidate self-reflection
- **Internal transfers** - When someone is moving to your team

**Note**: Use this question after you've already had a positive reference conversation. It works best when the reference feels they're helping the candidate succeed, not blocking them.
