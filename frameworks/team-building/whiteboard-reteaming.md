# Whiteboard Reteaming

> "We had courage together. We rolled these whiteboards out and it had the team structure with everyone's names on it... People were invited to look, give feedback. They identified mistakes that we had in the design." - Heidi Helfand

## What It Is

Whiteboard Reteaming is a transparent, collaborative approach to organizational change where leaders visualize proposed team structures on whiteboards and invite team members to see, critique, and improve the design before finalizing.

The approach originated from Christian Lima at Spotify and was adopted at Procore. It represents a middle ground between secret executive planning and fully open self-selection—allowing input while maintaining leadership accountability for final decisions.

## How It Works

### The Whiteboard Contents

Display for each team:
- **Team name** - What the team will be called
- **Team mission** - Why this team exists
- **Current members** - Names in their existing positions
- **Open slots** - How many positions need to be hired
- **Reporting structure** - Who the team reports to

### The Process

1. **Leaders design the initial structure** - A small group develops a starting point over several weeks

2. **Roll out the whiteboards** - Make the proposed structure visible to affected employees

3. **Invite feedback** - Give people time to:
   - Identify mistakes in the design
   - Suggest improvements ("This team might be better over here, and here's why")
   - See opportunities ("I'm interested in this role—might I be considered?")
   - Ask questions and get answers

4. **Incorporate feedback** - Update the design based on input

5. **Finalize and communicate** - Make final decisions and announce the structure

## How to Apply It

### Before Rolling Out Whiteboards:

1. **Build courage** - This will feel scary. Accept that making plans visible is uncomfortable but valuable.

2. **Have a starting point** - Don't show up with blank whiteboards. People need a proposal to react to.

3. **Be clear on decision rights** - Use RIDE: Who requested this? Who gives input? Who decides? Who executes?

4. **Time-box the process** - Set a clear timeline. Be biased toward shorter rather than longer.

### When Rolling Out:

1. **Explain the "why"** - Help people understand the business reasons for the change

2. **Acknowledge uncertainty** - This is a proposal, not a final decree

3. **Create safe channels for feedback** - Some people won't speak up publicly

4. **Be prepared for emotions** - Changes impact people's daily lives; some may feel triggered

### After Feedback:

1. **Show what changed** - Let people see their input was heard

2. **Explain what didn't change and why** - When you don't take feedback, explain your reasoning

3. **Move quickly to implementation** - Don't let the planning phase drag on

## When to Use It

- Major team restructures affecting many people
- Growing and splitting large teams into multiple smaller teams
- Consolidating or merging teams
- Creating new teams with unclear staffing
- Any reorg where input from affected people would improve the design

## Variations on Transparency

Whiteboard Reteaming sits in the middle of a transparency spectrum:

| Approach | Description | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Closed planning** | Leaders decide, announce | Acquisitions, layoffs, rapid crisis response |
| **Whiteboard Reteaming** | Leaders propose, get input, decide | Most reorgs and restructures |
| **Self-selection events** | Teams pitch, individuals choose | High-trust cultures, strategic priority shifts |

Redgate Software uses open self-selection events where teams give pitches and employees select their preferred teams. This requires high organizational trust but maximizes agency.

## Benefits

- **Better designs** - People closest to the work spot problems leaders miss
- **Reduced surprise** - No shocking announcements; people see it coming
- **Increased ownership** - People who gave input feel more invested
- **Career opportunities visible** - People can see and express interest in new roles
- **Faster adjustment** - The transition phase is easier when people were involved in planning
