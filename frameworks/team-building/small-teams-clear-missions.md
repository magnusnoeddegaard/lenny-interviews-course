# Small Teams With Clear Missions

> "If there's 300 people trying to work on one thing, the sheer communication challenges, Dunbar's number, all of those things come into play and it's really, really hard to act quickly." - Jeremy Henrickson

## What It Is

Small Teams With Clear Missions is an organizational principle for maintaining velocity at scale. Rather than having large groups coordinate on complex problems, you break down what seems like one large problem into sufficiently small pieces that small groups (often 4-6 people) can attack wholeheartedly while minimizing horizontal communication across teams.

The key insight is that coordination overhead grows exponentially with team size, but the problems you're solving don't require that much coordination if you scope them correctly. A small team with a clear mandate can move faster than a large team with shared responsibilities.

## How It Works

The model operates on several principles:

1. **Single Mission Focus**: Each team owns one clearly defined problem and nothing else
2. **Minimized Dependencies**: Teams are structured to minimize the need to coordinate with other teams
3. **End-to-End Ownership**: The small team handles everything from design to delivery for their domain
4. **Senior Leadership Access**: Despite management layers, anyone can directly observe what's happening at the team level

At Rippling, this manifests as their approach to new products: a single founding engineer, a design partner, and a few additional engineers building an entire product line (like time and attendance) over 6-9 months. They don't need to coordinate extensively with the payroll team or benefits team—they just focus monomaniacally on their problem.

## How to Apply It

1. **Break down the problem space** - Identify how to decompose your large product or goal into independently executable chunks
2. **Find a founding owner** - Assign one entrepreneurial person who deeply understands the problem to lead each mission
3. **Keep the team small** - Start with 1-4 people; only expand when the mission proves it needs more resources
4. **Define clear boundaries** - Make explicit what this team owns and what they don't, including integration points with other teams
5. **Provide platform support** - Invest in underlying platforms that reduce decision-making complexity for each domain team
6. **Maintain visibility** - Senior leaders should be able to go directly to any team and see what's happening without layers of filtering

## When to Use It

- When you need to maintain startup velocity as you scale
- When launching new product lines or significant features
- When coordination overhead is slowing down execution
- When you have entrepreneurial people who thrive with ownership and autonomy
