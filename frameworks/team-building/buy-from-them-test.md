# Buy From Them Test

> "Those first couple reps have to be people you would buy your own product from. That's it." - Jason Lemkin

## What It Is

The Buy From Them Test is a simple but powerful hiring heuristic for early sales hires: before you hire a sales rep, ask yourself honestly whether you would buy your own product from this person. Not whether you would buy *something* from them—but whether you would buy *your specific product* from them.

This matters because leads are precious in the early days. You might only have three leads a month. If you give two to someone who can't close, your company might die. The stakes are that high.

## How It Works

When evaluating early sales hires, the traditional criteria often fail:

**What founders typically look for (and shouldn't prioritize):**
- Previous employer logos (Twilio, CloudFlare, Snowflake)
- Ability to talk the acronym talk (ACV, NRR, etc.)
- Matching deal sizes from previous roles
- Industry expertise

**What actually matters:**
- Would you buy your product from this person?
- Do they understand your product and your customers' problems?
- Can they explain why your product solves the problem in a way you believe?

The test works because it's unfakeable. When you listen to someone pitch your product, you know instantly if they understand it deeply enough to represent it.

## How to Apply It

### During Interviews

1. **Interview at least 30 candidates** - 20 won't have done any prep. 8 will be okay. Maybe 2 will be magic.

2. **Give them the product knowledge** - Share your explainer videos, webinars, customer testimonials. Don't trap them—give them time to learn.

3. **Have them sell you the product** - Not "sell me this pen"—"sell me *this app*." In a real demo setting.

4. **Ask yourself honestly** - Would I buy from this person? Not "do they have a great LinkedIn?" but "do I believe them?"

### What to Look For

- **Deep understanding of the problem** - They can articulate customer pain in their own words
- **Confidence with core value prop** - They know the 10x feature that makes you different
- **Honest about limitations** - Best reps tell prospects when *not* to buy
- **Able to go beyond the script** - They answer questions beyond the basic 10

### Red Flags

- They describe your product in generic terms
- They can't handle questions about integrations or workflows
- They only know the pitch, not the product
- They never went to your website or watched an explainer video

## The Pirates and Romantics

Jason Lemkin describes ideal early sales hires as "pirates and romantics"—people with a few extra IQ points who have inexplicably fallen in love with your feature-poor product.

They're often:
- Not from obvious backgrounds
- Perhaps struggling at their last role or between jobs
- Quirky in ways that don't fit typical sales molds
- Passionate about solving the specific problem you solve

The first rep Lemkin hired was living in his brother's garage. But he understood the product better than anyone else. That rep closed the first five-figure deal, six-figure deal, and seven-figure TCV deal.

## Why It Works

1. **Leads are precious** - In early stages, you can't afford to waste leads on someone who can't convert
2. **Trust is earned in the middle** - Great salespeople are trusted advisors, not product pushers
3. **Product knowledge is the weapon** - Early sales reps must be product savants; later sales reps can rely on sales engineers
4. **Customers love founders** - But they'll accept a rep who demonstrates the same depth of knowledge

## When to Use It

- Hiring your first 2-10 sales reps
- Evaluating any sales hire in an early-stage company
- Before you have the luxury of support structures (sales engineers, enablement teams)
- When you're the founder still selling and need to find someone who can match your authenticity

## Common Mistakes

- Hiring based on logos on LinkedIn instead of the gut-check
- Getting tired after interviewing 20 people and settling for "okay"
- Believing someone who talks the talk but hasn't done the homework
- Thinking process and playbooks can substitute for product understanding
