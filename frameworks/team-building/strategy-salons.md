# Strategy Salons (Nerd Clubs)

> "These are my secret weapon. When you do this properly, you get something magical. You get a group that people find intrinsically valuable for its own sake and just enjoy participating in and find meaning in, that also stochastically spins off changing insights for the surrounding context because you're searching through these ideas in a low stakes environment." - Alex Komoroske

## What It Is

Strategy Salons (also called Nerd Clubs) are opt-in, low-stakes groups that use collaborative debate to generate strategic insights. Unlike formal strategy processes that produce "expensive pageantry," these groups create spaces where half-formed ideas can be explored, tested, and refined without political risk.

The magic comes from three properties: they're optional (only people who intrinsically want to be there come), they're collaborative (only "yes, and" energy), and they're diverse (deliberately adding people with different perspectives over time). This combination allows ideas to emerge that couldn't be found through top-down planning.

Alex Komoroske has started 8-9 of these over the years and considers them essential to his approach.

## How It Works

**Core Principles:**

1. **Optional and secret** - Nothing important is decided here, so there's no political risk. Only people who want to be there show up.

2. **"Yes, and" only** - If someone shares an idea you think is dumb, you can simply not engage. If you want to engage, say "Oh, that's interesting. I would apply this lens instead. I wonder if that applies here."

3. **Diverse perspectives** - Deliberately add people with different backgrounds, skills, and viewpoints over time.

**Why It Works:**
- Time is limited, so people naturally build on the most interesting ideas
- Ideas that resonate across diverse groups have higher "ceiling" potential
- Low stakes = willingness to share half-formed thoughts
- Intrinsic motivation = high energy and engagement

**What You Get:**
- An "idea lab" that generates novel insights
- Pattern-matching across different problem domains
- A testing ground for ideas before they need to be defended publicly
- A community people find meaningful for its own sake

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with a seed crystal**
   - Begin with 3-4 people who already talk naturally
   - You need high-energy people to catalyze participation
   - Name it something self-selecting ("Navel Gazers," "Nerd Club")

2. **Set explicit norms**
   - This is collaborative debate, not debate debate
   - We're not deciding anything important
   - "Yes, and" responses only

3. **Keep the space small**
   - "A community with zero people speaking is dead. A community with one person speaking doesn't yet realize it's dead."
   - Small space + few people = active conversation

4. **Add people slowly (1-3 per week max)**
   - Too many new people scrambles the norms
   - 1-in-5 ratio of certain personality types can ruin the vibe
   - Look for diverse perspectives, not similar ones

5. **Seed conversations behind the scenes**
   - When someone shares an idea privately, say "You should share that in the group"
   - Engage visibly when they do
   - Others assume they proactively stuck their neck out—this becomes the norm

6. **Create FOMO**
   - Host occasional live conversations
   - Share notes afterward: "Thanks to Sarah and Jeff for an amazing conversation about X"
   - People who didn't attend want to come next time

7. **Never break quorum**
   - If a live session doesn't have enough people, it looks dead
   - Pre-confirm attendance before announcing sessions

## When to Use It

**Great for:**
- Complex, ambiguous strategic problems
- When formal processes create more pageantry than insight
- Testing controversial ideas before they're ready
- Building cross-functional alignment organically
- Finding unexpected connections between domains

**Not for:**
- When you need a specific decision
- When there's one "right" answer to find
- When speed matters more than insight quality
- When you can't protect the group from political interference

**Warning:**
You can't force outcomes from these groups. If you try to steer them toward a specific answer, you'll kill the emergent magic. They produce insights stochastically—you have to accept that.
