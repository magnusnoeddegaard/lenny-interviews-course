# Small Bus Metaphor

> "The smaller the bus, it's easier to turn corners, easier to accelerate, easier to maneuver. The bigger the bus it is, bigger the boat or bigger the bus, slow down. And as a leader in the company, you decide who sit around you on the bus seats. That dictates how fast our overall bus moves, dictates your work and life experience at this company because you pick your roommate, you pick your seat mates." - Ivan Zhao

## What It Is

The Small Bus Metaphor is Notion's internal framework for thinking about team size and hiring decisions. It reframes company building not as filling an org chart, but as choosing who sits next to you on a small vehicle where every seat matters.

Unlike a large cruise ship or bus that can absorb mediocre passengers without noticing, a small bus feels every single addition. Each person affects the vehicle's ability to accelerate, maneuver, and reach its destination. Leaders don't just hire—they curate their seatmates. And because the bus is small, there's nowhere to hide from the consequences of bad choices.

The metaphor resonates because it captures the tradeoffs that matter: a bigger bus can carry more people but turns slowly and loses agility. A small bus requires discipline but maintains speed and responsiveness. In Notion's case, this philosophy helped them stay profitable, avoid fundraising pressure, and ship faster than larger competitors.

## How It Works

The Small Bus Metaphor operates on several interconnected principles:

1. **Size determines agility**: Small teams can make decisions quickly, change direction without coordination overhead, and move faster than large organizations

2. **Every seat matters**: On a small bus, each person's contribution (or lack thereof) is visible and felt by everyone. There's no place to coast.

3. **Leaders choose seatmates**: Hiring isn't HR's job—it's the core responsibility of leaders. You're picking who you'll work alongside every day.

4. **Experience quality compounds**: Your work experience is determined by your seatmates. Brilliant colleagues make work energizing. Mediocre ones make it draining.

5. **Systems beat headcount**: Before adding seats, ask whether a better system could solve the problem instead. The best teams stay small by building leverage through tools and abstraction.

## How to Apply It

1. **Reframe hiring conversations** - Instead of "do we need more people?", ask "can we solve this with a better system or tool?" Only add seats when you've exhausted systematic solutions.

2. **Treat every hire as a seatmate decision** - Imagine sitting next to this person for years. Will they elevate the bus or slow it down? Will they make the journey better or worse?

3. **Track talent density, not headcount** - Notion measures revenue per employee rather than team size. Small and effective beats large and diluted.

4. **Make the metaphor explicit** - Share this mental model with your team. When they understand that each seat affects everyone's experience and the bus's speed, they become more thoughtful about who they advocate for.

5. **Protect maneuverability** - Before any significant headcount increase, ask: "Will this slow our ability to turn? Is the tradeoff worth it?"

## When to Use It

- When deciding whether to hire or build better systems
- When evaluating candidates—ask "do I want them on our bus?"
- When team members advocate for hiring without clear leverage
- When you notice the organization slowing down as it grows
- When making the case for staying lean to your team or investors
