# Celebrate Publicly

> "From the very first person we hired, we celebrated them publicly. The fact that they joined. And in a very heartfelt way, telling you about them as a person and what they did... Whenever we ship something, we go out of our way to celebrate the people that worked on it publicly. I think there's a CEO-hero worship sometimes in Silicon Valley." - Josh Miller

## What It Is

Celebrate Publicly is a talent strategy that treats every hire announcement and team achievement as a public celebration. Instead of the CEO taking credit or keeping team accomplishments internal, you actively promote individual team members and their contributions to the outside world.

The practice serves multiple purposes: it recognizes the people actually doing the work, it attracts talent who want to be recognized, and it builds a culture where credit flows to contributors rather than leaders. It also counters the "CEO-hero worship" tendency in Silicon Valley where founders get credit for work they didn't do.

At The Browser Company, this started with their very first hire—before anyone would have heard of them—simply because it felt authentic to celebrate someone joining the team. That authenticity created a reinforcing cycle.

## How It Works

The practice operates through several mechanisms:

1. **Hire announcements as product launches**: When someone joins, write a thoughtful public post about who they are as a person and what they've accomplished

2. **Feature attribution**: When you ship something, publicly tag and celebrate the specific people who built it—not the company or CEO

3. **Show genuine enthusiasm**: Use authentic language ("She killed me! Look how cool this is!") rather than corporate messaging

4. **Resist CEO centrality**: Actively push credit toward the team, even when media or public attention defaults to founders

5. **Create a reinforcing cycle**: People who've done remarkable things see that your company genuinely recognizes contributors, making them more likely to join

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with your first hire**: Don't wait until you're established. Every person matters from day one.

2. **Make it personal, not professional**: Write about who they are as a person, not just their resume accomplishments

3. **Be specific about contributions**: Don't say "the team shipped X." Say "Alexandre built this animation. Sherry designed this interaction."

4. **Use social media authentically**: Twitter/LinkedIn posts, team member tags, genuine excitement

5. **Include non-obvious roles**: Celebrate operations people, membership team, storytellers—not just engineers and designers

6. **Have the CEO step back**: Leaders should actively redirect attention to team members in interviews, press, and public forums

## When to Use It

- When competing for talent against larger companies with more resources
- When building a craft-focused culture where recognition matters
- When trying to break the "all credit goes to founder" pattern
- When you want to attract senior talent who've "been there, done that" but want recognition
- When building in public and want authenticity in your employer brand

## Why It Works

People who've achieved success elsewhere often feel their contributions got absorbed into company credit or CEO narratives. When they see a company that genuinely celebrates individual contributors:

- They believe they'll be recognized, not invisible
- They trust the company actually values them
- They see evidence of the culture, not just claims about it
- They want to be part of a team that celebrates each other
