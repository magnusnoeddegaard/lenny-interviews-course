# Local CEO Model

> "Product owners are central to the company and its growth. They are end-to-end responsible for the product, for this part of the business, and for their customers to be happy." - Dmitry Zlokazov

## What It Is

The Local CEO Model is Revolut's approach to product management where product owners (their term for product managers) function as local CEOs of their domains. Unlike traditional product management where PMs coordinate across functions but don't directly manage people, local CEOs have engineers, designers, data analysts, and operational managers reporting directly to them.

This structure creates true ownership by making product owners the line managers for everyone on their cross-functional team. The product owner defines what needs to be done (the roadmap, priorities, and targets), while functional managers ensure quality and technical excellence in how things are built.

The model differs from the "mini-CEO" metaphor often used loosely in product management. At Revolut, it's literal: product owners have hiring/firing authority, direct reports, P&L responsibility, and are accountable for business metrics—not just product outcomes.

## How It Works

**Team Structure:**
- Product owners lead fully cross-functional teams with all necessary functions embedded
- Everyone on the team has both a line manager (the product owner) and a functional manager
- The product owner decides what to build; functional managers ensure how it's built meets quality standards

**Three Types of Local CEOs:**
1. **UX Product Owners** - Consumer-facing products, strong taste and user empathy
2. **Technical Product Owners** - Deep technical systems, often former engineers
3. **Data Science Product Owners** - ML/data products, former data scientists who grew into management

**Common Traits Across All Three (85-90%):**
- Great problem-solving with both linear and creative thinking
- Deep customer empathy and ability to translate it to the team
- Technical depth—willing to sit with engineers and read code
- Strong business acumen and metric orientation
- Ability to go deep into details while maintaining helicopter view

## How to Apply It

1. **Restructure reporting lines** - Have engineers, designers, and analysts report to product owners, not just functional leads

2. **Grant real authority** - Give product owners actual decision-making power over their domain, including headcount and budget

3. **Define clear swim lanes** - Product owner owns "what" (roadmap, priorities, targets); functional managers own "how" (quality, technical standards)

4. **Create autonomy with accountability** - Trust teams to operate independently while maintaining regular reviews where they defend their logic and results

5. **Allow specialization** - Let product owners develop expertise in UX, technical, or data domains based on their background, while maintaining common core competencies

## When to Use It

- Companies building complex products that require deep domain expertise
- Organizations where product teams need to move fast without heavy coordination overhead
- Situations where traditional matrix structures create too much coordination friction
- Companies with founders who want to maintain oversight without micromanaging hundreds of projects
- Growth-stage companies that need to ship many products in parallel

**When It May Not Fit:**
- Early-stage startups where everyone wears multiple hats
- Organizations where functional excellence matters more than speed
- Cultures with strong functional identity that would resist cross-functional reporting
