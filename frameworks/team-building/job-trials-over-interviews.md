# Job Trials Over Interviews

> "If I told you, 'Hey, I want to go hire the best race car driver,' there's not really that many questions you could ask them except for put them in the car." - Farhan Thawar

## What It Is

Interviews are not a good predictor of job performance. Everyone knows this—some people interview well but underperform, others interview poorly but excel. The solution: put people in the actual job and evaluate real work product.

Farhan's approach is radical: at his startup, he almost didn't interview anybody. He just said "come in and work." This led to higher early attrition (~20% before 90 days) but near-zero attrition after 90 days (<1%), because both parties knew exactly what they were getting.

## How It Works

**Why Interviews Fail:**
- Optimized for interview performance, not job performance
- Can't assess cultural fit from hypothetical scenarios
- Resume bias (PhD vs. self-taught) doesn't predict success
- Hours of interviews << months of actual work

**The Job Trial Model:**
- Bring candidates in to do actual work
- Use the first 30-60-90 days as the real evaluation
- Set explicit expectations that this period is mutual assessment
- Be willing to part ways quickly if it's not a fit

**The Real Example:**
At Farhan's startup, he hired two people for ML:
- Person A: PhD, taught at university, recommended by an employee
- Person B: Guy from a coffee shop, never had a software job

Person A was let go within weeks. Person B is still at Shopify years later and is a phenomenal engineer. The difference was only visible through actual work, not credentials.

## How to Apply It

1. **Internship programs at scale** - Shopify hires 1,000 interns/year. Four months of real work is the best possible "interview." Top performers convert to full-time.

2. **Contract-to-hire** - Start people on contracts where both parties can evaluate fit before full commitment.

3. **Pair programming trials** - Have candidates pair program with the team for a day. You'll learn more than from whiteboard problems.

4. **Set expectations explicitly** - "We'll both spend the first 90 days evaluating fit. That's good for you and good for us."

5. **Survey new hires early** - Shopify sends a Slack survey: "How happy are you with the person you hired?" This creates feedback loops.

## The Intern Program as Interview

Shopify's perspective on internships:
- Not community service—interns are genuinely useful
- They bring different perspectives (grew up with AI, different shopping habits)
- Four months of real work is the ultimate evaluation
- Interns who pair program are always more intense than full-timers
- Some become full-time, some take the Shopify imprint elsewhere

Both outcomes are wins.

## What Changes With Volume

At Shopify's scale, you can't do pure job trials for everyone. But you can:
- Make the interview process as close to real work as possible
- Use the 30-60-90 days intentionally as extended evaluation
- Run massive intern programs as your primary hiring funnel
- Be transparent that early days are mutual assessment
