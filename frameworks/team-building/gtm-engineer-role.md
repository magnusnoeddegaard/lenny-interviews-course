# GTM Engineer Role

> "Bringing technical prowess to bear on go-to-market in general so you can have a lot better tooling, data use, and increasingly bringing AI to bear to re-architect your workflows." - Jeanne DeWitt Grosser

## What It Is

The GTM Engineer is an emerging role that combines sales/go-to-market expertise with technical engineering skills. These professionals analyze existing sales workflows, shadow top performers to understand best practices, and then build AI agents that automate or augment those workflows.

Unlike traditional sales operations or systems administrators who configure off-the-shelf tools, GTM Engineers write code to build custom agents tailored to their company's specific context, content, and processes. The role represents the convergence of sales knowledge with software development capabilities.

The best GTM Engineers come from technical sales backgrounds (like sales engineers) rather than pure engineering, because understanding what makes good GTM is critical to building effective agents.

## How It Works

The GTM Engineer process follows a systematic approach:

1. **Shadow Top Performers**: Observe your highest-performing salespeople to understand their workflows in detail. Note every tab they have open, every database they check, every pattern they follow.

2. **Identify Legible Workflows**: Find processes that are relatively deterministic and can be written down as clear steps. Start with simpler workflows (like inbound lead qualification) before tackling complex ones (like enterprise prospecting).

3. **Build Agents**: Code AI agents that replicate human workflows, combining deterministic logic with AI for research and personalization.

4. **Keep Human-in-Loop**: Have humans review agent outputs before actions are taken. Track rejection rates and use feedback to improve the agent.

5. **Measure Against Human KPIs**: Track the same metrics you'd hold humans accountable to (conversion rates, response times, touches to convert) to validate agent effectiveness.

6. **Redeploy Humans**: Move freed-up human capacity to higher-value activities that require more judgment and creativity.

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with the Right Profile**: Hire people with both GTM experience and technical skills. Sales engineers who were developers before joining sales are ideal.

2. **Choose Your First Workflow**: Select an inbound qualification workflow as your first project—it's more legible and deterministic than outbound.

3. **Document the Ideal Workflow**: Create a detailed map of what your best performer does, including all the tools and data sources they use.

4. **Build Incrementally**: Start with a narrow agent, keep humans in the loop, and expand scope as confidence grows.

5. **Set Clear Success Metrics**: Define what "as good as a human" means for your specific workflow before building.

## When to Use It

- When you have at least 10 people in your sales organization and documented playbooks
- When you've identified repeatable workflows that top performers follow
- When you're spending significant money on routine prospecting or qualification tasks
- When you want to increase the percentage of time sellers spend with customers (typically only 30-40%)
- When you can hire or develop people with both sales and technical backgrounds
