# Hire Painfully Slowly

> "We had this mantra internally... which was 'Hire painfully slowly.' The temptation is once things start working, you just start scaling this thing and start adding more and more headcount. For us that didn't feel right." - Grant Lee

## What It Is

Hire Painfully Slowly is a deliberate resistance to the natural pressure to scale headcount when a company is growing. The framework recognizes that fast hiring almost always means lower hiring bars, and lower bars create compounding problems: cultural dilution, reduced impact per person, and higher churn.

Grant Lee describes how Gamma built a company worth over $2 billion with just around 30 people—all of whom can fit in a small restaurant—while serving 50+ million users globally. Their first 10 employees are still with the company five years later.

The core insight: what you're optimizing for matters. If your goal is "hire 100 people this year," you'll hit that goal at the expense of quality. If your goal is "only add people who represent our DNA," you'll build a fundamentally different organization.

## How It Works

**1. Set the Right Goal**
If your goal is "double headcount," the thing that drops is quality. The goal becomes hitting a number, not maintaining a bar.

**2. Replicate the DNA**
Brian Chesky's principle: get the first 10 right, then replicate. But that only works if the original 10 are cohesive in values, principles, and ambition. What are you even replicating otherwise?

**3. Reduce the Leaky Bucket**
Think about retention the same way you think about product: a revolving door has massive continuity costs. Gamma's first 10 employees are all still there. That tribal knowledge compounds.

**4. High Leverage Per Person**
A lean team means every individual has high impact daily. This attracts people who want ownership and agency, which creates a virtuous cycle.

## How to Apply It

### Setting Up for Slow Hiring

1. **Define your DNA explicitly** - What are the shared values, principles, and ambitions of your founding team?
2. **Invest heavily in first 10** - These people define what you replicate
3. **Ask "would I want 10 of this person?"** - Not just "can they do the job?"

### Resisting Pressure

4. **Never set headcount goals** - Measure output, not input. Adding people isn't progress.
5. **Question every role** - "What if we didn't hire for this? What else could we try?"
6. **Accept slower growth** - Some things will happen slower. That's the tradeoff.

### Maintaining Quality at Scale

7. **Never drop the bar** - Every hire should represent the company you want to build
8. **Bet big on exceptional people** - "When you find someone exceptional, bet big on them"
9. **A-players want playing time** - Great people want hard problems and ownership. Give it to them.

## The Efficiency Dividend

Gamma's economics demonstrate what's possible:
- ~30 people serving 50M+ users
- $100M+ ARR
- Profitable and growing
- All first 10 employees still there

By hiring slowly, they maintained:
- Strong unit economics
- High experimentation velocity
- Lean overhead
- Cultural coherence

## When to Use It

- **Always** - This isn't a phase-specific framework; it's a philosophy
- **Especially when growing fast** - When pressure to hire is highest, discipline matters most
- **When fundraising** - Don't let runway become an excuse to lower bars
- **When competitors are scaling** - They may be building problems, not advantages

## The Counter-Argument

Some situations genuinely require scaling:
- Certain roles have irreducible workloads (support, sales)
- Specific expertise you simply don't have
- Regulatory or compliance requirements

The framework isn't "never hire"—it's "resist the default assumption that more people = more progress."

## Warning Signs You're Hiring Too Fast

- People are joining and leaving within 1-2 years
- New hires don't feel like an extension of the team
- Impact per person is declining
- You can't articulate what you're replicating
- Hiring goals are set independently of output goals
