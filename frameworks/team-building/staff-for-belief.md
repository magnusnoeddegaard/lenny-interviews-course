# Staff for Belief

> "You need to staff projects with the team of people that are well equipped from a skillset standpoint, but more importantly have an obsession with the idea they want to pursue. It's going to make them work harder, it's going to make them be more creative." - Kayvon Beykpour

## What It Is

Staff for Belief is the principle that when staffing speculative or risky projects, the most important criterion is whether the team members genuinely believe in and are obsessed with the idea—not just whether they have the right skills or happen to be available.

In large organizations, project staffing often becomes a game of musical chairs: whoever is available gets assigned to the next project, regardless of their passion for it. This leads to projects being staffed with capable but unengaged people who may even be skeptical of the idea's merit.

This is the opposite of startup conditions, where founders and early employees are irrationally obsessed with their vision. That obsession is often what gets startups through the inevitable valleys of difficulty. Enterprise teams working on speculative projects need the same fuel.

## How It Works

**The Startup Condition**: A startup would never succeed if the people working on it don't believe in it. They need to be "to the point of being perhaps irrational, obsessed with that idea."

**The Organizational Anti-pattern**: In functional organizations (separate product, engineering, design functions), different leaders make staffing decisions. This leads to:
- People assigned based on availability, not passion
- Teams where members disagree about whether the project should exist
- Individuals being told "don't work on this—it's bad for your career"

**The Cost of Disbelief**: If team members don't believe in the project:
- They work less hard and less creatively
- They lack the drive to "will this thing into existence"
- Every obstacle becomes a reason to give up rather than push through
- Internal skepticism spreads and undermines the project

**The Benefit of Belief**: When team members are obsessed with the idea:
- They bring infectious energy that attracts others
- They push through pain and setbacks
- They make creative leaps that skeptics wouldn't attempt
- They see truth—whether something is working—without motivated reasoning to dismiss it

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify believers early** - Before staffing a speculative project, find people in your organization who have expressed interest or passion for this type of problem. Look for unsolicited ideas in the same space.

2. **Recruit, don't assign** - Treat internal staffing more like recruiting. Pitch the project's vision and let people opt in rather than being assigned.

3. **Test for genuine excitement** - Ask candidates: "What excites you about this project?" Look for authentic enthusiasm, not just willingness to work on whatever is needed.

4. **Create space for matching** - Build systems that let people express interest in upcoming projects before staffing decisions are made.

5. **Protect believers from skeptics** - If you have believers on a project, don't force them to work alongside active skeptics. The dynamic will poison the work.

6. **Accept smaller teams** - It's better to have three true believers than ten lukewarm assignees. The believers will outperform and attract more talent.

7. **Use acqui-hires strategically** - Acquiring small companies to get founders who believe in a specific problem is an extreme version of this principle.

## When to Use It

- When launching speculative or risky new products
- When working on projects that challenge organizational sacred cows
- When building new features that require conviction to push through skepticism
- When staffing skunkworks or innovation teams
- Any time the path to success requires people to "will something into existence"
