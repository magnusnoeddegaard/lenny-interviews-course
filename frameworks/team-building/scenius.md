# Scenius

> "Brian Eno has this great word that he uses, scenius is the collective idea of genius... that's something that's really magical that I've experienced in my career, but usually in smaller groups." - Bob Baxley

## What It Is

Scenius is a term coined by musician Brian Eno to describe the collective genius that emerges when small groups work together. It's the creative magic that happens between minds—not the work of a lone genius, but the spark created by the right collection of people collaborating intimately.

The concept directly challenges two common approaches: the myth of the individual genius, and the fallacy that more people means better results. The Beatles had four people. The original Mac had 20 people on the patent. The iPhone had 24 people on Project Purple. These weren't massive groups, yet they produced transformational products.

As Baxley puts it: "You get The Beatles with four people, you don't get The Beatles with eight people and you certainly don't get it with 24 people."

## How It Works

Scenius depends on several conditions:

1. **Small team size** - Large groups dilute the creative connection. Four is often better than eight, eight better than twenty-four.

2. **Shared creative purpose** - Everyone must be invested in making something together, not just executing assigned tasks.

3. **New work requires smaller teams** - Once you know what you're building (like Disneyland's vision is set), you can scale. But figuring out something new requires intimacy.

4. **Complementary mindsets** - Different perspectives (design, engineering, product) create productive tension where "all the magic happens."

The reason Apple can operate with six designers on a store running in 30+ countries doing billions in revenue—while other companies would need 60—is because they have clarity of vision. When you have scenius-level alignment, you can do exponentially more with fewer people.

## How to Apply It

1. **Keep new initiative teams small** - When exploring new territory, resist the urge to throw resources at problems. More people slows you down.

2. **Protect the creative core** - Even as projects scale into production, maintain a small group responsible for the creative vision.

3. **Scale after vision clarity** - Only add people once you know what you're building. Then they can understand where their piece fits into the whole.

4. **Create conditions for connection** - Scenius requires people to spend enough time together to develop shared understanding and shorthand.

5. **Embrace creative tension** - Don't smooth over disagreements between functions. The rub between perspectives is where magic happens.

6. **Remember: teams aren't committees** - Design by committee fails because it lacks the intimate creative connection of scenius.

## When to Use It

- When staffing new product initiatives
- When a large team is moving slowly despite adding resources
- When trying to recreate the magic of an early-stage startup
- When deciding whether to expand a team that's working well
- When explaining why more engineers/designers won't solve a creative problem
