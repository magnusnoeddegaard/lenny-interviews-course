# Convince Them Not to Join

> "Our goal of interviews is to convince people not to join The Browser Company. If I have an interview with someone, I don't pitch them and say, 'What do you want to ask me? Anything you want? I'll be super honest, most people shouldn't want to work here.'" - Josh Miller

## What It Is

Convince Them Not to Join is an interviewing philosophy that flips the traditional recruiting dynamic. Instead of selling candidates on why your company is great, you actively try to help them discover reasons they might not want to join. This ensures that people who do join are doing so with clear eyes and genuine fit.

The approach reflects a deeper belief: if your company is genuinely right for someone, they'll still want to join even after you've been completely honest about the challenges. And if it's not right for them, it's better for everyone to discover that before they start.

This philosophy is authentic, not manipulative. It's not "hard to get" as a tactic—it's genuine transparency about fit. Combined with radical openness to candidate questions, it creates interviews that feel more like real conversations than sales pitches.

## How It Works

The interview dynamic shifts in several ways:

1. **Lead with "most people shouldn't want to work here"**: Set the tone that you're looking for specific fit, not just impressive candidates

2. **Let candidates ask anything**: Open the floor to their questions and answer with radical honesty

3. **Share the hard parts proactively**: Talk about challenges, things that aren't working, cultural elements that might not suit everyone

4. **Pay attention to what they ask**: What candidates choose to ask reveals as much about them as your answers reveal about you

5. **Look for authenticity in their response**: Do they genuinely engage with the challenges, or do they give interview-performance answers?

## How to Apply It

1. **Reframe your interview goals**: You're not trying to "close" candidates. You're trying to help them make a good decision.

2. **Create space for real questions**: "What do you want to ask me? Anything you want. I'll be honest."

3. **Share what's hard about the role/company**: What aspects of culture or work might frustrate someone? Share those openly.

4. **Notice their questions**: Someone asking about career ladder is different from someone asking about the craft of the work. Neither is wrong, but it reveals fit.

5. **Be honest about unknowns**: "I don't know if this will work" is more trustworthy than false confidence.

6. **Don't hard sell**: If they're wavering, let them waver. A reluctant hire helps no one.

## When to Use It

- When hiring for culture fit matters as much as skills
- When your company has genuine tradeoffs (startup chaos, unconventional practices, high expectations)
- When you have more candidates than positions and can be selective
- When previous hires haven't worked out due to misaligned expectations
- When building a team where everyone needs to be genuinely committed

## Why It Works

**For candidates**:
- They feel respected and treated like adults
- They can make an informed decision
- They arrive with realistic expectations
- They feel they "chose" to join rather than being "sold"

**For companies**:
- You filter for genuine enthusiasm over interview performance
- Retention improves because people joined with clear eyes
- Culture stays coherent because only people who truly fit join
- The candidates you lose probably wouldn't have worked out anyway
