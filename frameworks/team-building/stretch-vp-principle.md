# Stretch VP Principle

> "Most of them should be stretches. If you hire the seasoned one, they're not going to work." - Jason Lemkin

## What It Is

The Stretch VP Principle is the counterintuitive hiring advice for your first VP of Sales: don't hire the seasoned veteran with multiple VP titles on their resume. Instead, hire someone stretching into the role for the first time—typically a director or senior director ready to level up.

The seasoned VP won't work. They've forgotten how to do the actual work, they want process, and they're not willing to get in the trenches.

## How It Works

**Why Seasoned VPs Fail at Startups:**

1. **They want process, not hustle** - "First 30 days: set up territories, implement Salesforce, build enablement..."
2. **They don't know your product** - And they're not willing to learn it deeply
3. **They don't want to sell** - They want to manage from dashboards
4. **They expect infrastructure** - SDR teams, sales ops, enablement that doesn't exist
5. **They're burnt out** - Many veterans are tired and looking for an easier gig

**What a Stretch VP Brings:**

1. **Hunger** - This is their first shot at the title; they'll fight for it
2. **Recent IC experience** - They were in deals recently; they remember how to sell
3. **Willingness to learn** - They'll immerse in your product because they have to
4. **Energy** - They're not tired; they're excited
5. **Better economics** - Equity matters more to them; they bet on upside

## How to Apply It

### Identifying Good Stretches

1. **Look for directors/senior directors** - One level below VP
2. **Recent IC wins** - They closed deals in last 12-18 months
3. **Hungry for the next level** - They want VP title and will earn it
4. **Willing to carry a bag** - They'll hit the field personally

### Interview Signals

5. **First 14 days** - Do they want to meet customers or set up process?
6. **In the deals** - Will they be on calls weekly?
7. **Product curiosity** - Do they want to learn how it works?
8. **No entourage demands** - They don't need to bring their whole team

### When You've Found the Right Stretch

9. **Invest in their growth** - They're learning on the job; support them
10. **Expect manager hiring** - They scale if they can hire directors under them
11. **Give them room** - Let them develop their leadership style
12. **Check at 6 months** - Are they building leaders or drowning?

## The Scaling Test

A stretch VP scales if they can source strong managers beneath them. The pattern:
- Good: Hires experienced directors + promotes internally 50/50
- Bad: Can only promote junior internal people, can't attract outside talent

If they can't hire better managers, they'll drown in the details and the organization will crack.

## The Carry a Bag Question

"Should VP of Sales carry a bag?" has nuance, but in today's world, lean toward yes:

- Carrying a bag proves they still want to sell
- It forces product knowledge
- It keeps them connected to customer reality
- If they refuse, it signals they're checked out

The exact structure—full quota, half quota, backfilling—matters less than willingness.

## Red Flags: Seasoned VP Warning Signs

- "I'm going to spend the first month on process"
- "I have eight people I can bring with me"
- "I won't travel beyond [minimal radius]"
- Third or fourth VP role (they're not willing to do the job anymore)
- Focus on territory planning before understanding the product

## The Exception

There are rare cases where an experienced VP works:
- Very late stage (50M+) where infrastructure exists
- Super well-defined playbook they just need to execute
- Specific expertise your stretch lacks (enterprise, international)

But for most startups: hire the stretch.
