# Organism Team Building

> "Whenever I would hire people, I was trying to compose almost like an organism of strengths and then minimize the conflicts. That management team was the same management team from day one when we had nothing to $20 billion." - Jason Droege

## What It Is

Organism Team Building is an approach to assembling management teams that prioritizes complementary strengths and low-conflict dynamics over individual credentials. Rather than hiring the "best" person for each role independently, you compose the team as a whole—like building an organism where each part serves a function and works in harmony with the others.

The approach challenges conventional hiring wisdom that says you should always upgrade people as you scale. Instead, it bets that a team that knows each other's strengths and weaknesses, and can compensate for each other, will outperform a collection of individually impressive but less integrated people.

## How It Works

The framework operates on three principles:

**Complementary Strengths**
- Identify what strengths the team needs as a whole
- Hire people whose strengths fill gaps in the existing team
- Prioritize how people fit together over how impressive they are individually

**Conflict Minimization**
- Assess not just capability but how people will work together
- Identify potential friction points before they become problems
- Choose people who can genuinely collaborate, not just coexist

**Growth Confidence**
- Believe that smart, curious people can learn new skills
- Value trajectory and potential over experience at the next scale level
- If you learned to operate at scale, trust that others can too

## How to Apply It

1. **Map the whole team first** - Before hiring for a role, understand what the entire team needs to accomplish and what capabilities already exist.

2. **Look for compensation patterns** - The best teams have people who naturally cover for each other's weaknesses. Ask: who on the team will help this person succeed?

3. **Assess for integration, not just skills** - In interviews, evaluate how candidates will interact with existing team members, not just their individual capabilities.

4. **Resist the "hasn't seen this scale" objection** - The common advice is to replace people as you scale because they "haven't seen this level before." But if they're curious, adaptable, and work well with the team, they can learn.

5. **Protect team stability** - Droege's Uber Eats team stayed largely the same from $0 to $20B. Team continuity compounds knowledge and trust.

## The Three Interview Criteria

Droege reduces hiring to three questions that support organism-building:

1. **Are you a curious problem solver?** - Can you articulate how you think through problems? (Ensures adaptability as the company changes)

2. **Can you work across people?** - Are you humble enough to collaborate and lead effectively? (Ensures team integration)

3. **Are you a good leader?** - Can you bring others along with you? (Ensures the team can grow together)

## When to Use It

- Building founding teams or new business unit leadership
- Hiring for roles where team integration matters more than individual expertise
- Deciding whether to upgrade existing team members vs. keep them
- Evaluating team composition during rapid scaling
