# 10-Minute PM Test

> "If you are an account executive in my org and I put you in front of 10 engineers at our company, it should take them 10 minutes to figure out you aren't a product manager." - Jeanne DeWitt Grosser

## What It Is

The 10-Minute PM Test is a litmus test for evaluating the product depth of your sales team. The standard is simple: when placed in a room with engineers from your company, it should take at least 10 minutes before they realize the person is in sales, not product management.

This test represents a philosophy that the best sales organizations have such deep product knowledge that they can engage at a technical level, speak the same language as product and engineering, and contribute substantively to product discussions.

The test serves two purposes: it ensures salespeople can have credible technical conversations with customers, and it earns respect and trust from internal product and engineering teams.

## How It Works

The test evaluates several dimensions of product fluency:

1. **Technical Vocabulary**: Can the salesperson use technical terms correctly and naturally?

2. **Architecture Understanding**: Do they understand how the product works under the hood, not just what it does?

3. **Trade-off Reasoning**: Can they explain why certain product decisions were made?

4. **Customer Context Translation**: Can they connect customer needs to product capabilities with specificity?

5. **Roadmap Awareness**: Do they know what's being built and why?

## How to Apply It

1. **Set the Expectation in Hiring**: Interview for product curiosity and technical aptitude, not just sales skills. Look for candidates who ask deep questions about your product.

2. **Invest in Onboarding**: Give salespeople the same level of product training as new engineers. Have them build things with the product, read documentation, and understand the technical architecture.

3. **Require Ongoing Learning**: Make product knowledge part of regular training. When features launch, salespeople should understand not just what it does but how it works.

4. **Create Cross-Functional Exposure**: Have salespeople attend product reviews, engineering demos, and technical discussions. The osmosis builds understanding.

5. **Test Regularly**: Periodically put salespeople in situations where they're discussing the product with technical people. Observe how long it takes for the facade to break.

6. **Hire Technical Profiles**: Consider sales engineers, former developers, or consultants who can bring technical credibility to sales conversations.

## When to Use It

- When selling technical products to technical buyers
- When you want sales to be a trusted partner to product and engineering
- When your sales team needs to do consultative selling, not just transactional selling
- When product-market fit is still evolving and sales insights are critical to R&D
- When you're competing against products that are similar at the margin
