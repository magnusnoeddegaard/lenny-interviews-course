# Life Story Interview

> "You know what I don't like about resumes? It tells you what you did, but it doesn't tell you why you did those things." - Farhan Thawar

## What It Is

The Life Story interview is a Shopify hiring step that focuses on the *why* behind a candidate's career decisions, not just the *what* of their accomplishments. It's designed to uncover whether someone is a curious person with range—someone who's made intentional choices about their learning journey.

Resumes show you were a PM at Microsoft, then a PM at Stripe. The Life Story interview asks: *Why did you switch from Microsoft to Stripe?* That's the interesting part.

## How It Works

**What You're Looking For:**
- **Curiosity**: Are they genuinely interested in learning new things?
- **Range**: Have they explored different domains, roles, or challenges?
- **Intentionality**: Did they make active choices, or just follow the obvious path?
- **Self-awareness**: Do they understand their own motivations and patterns?

**The Key Question Pattern:**
Instead of "Tell me about your role at X," ask:
- "Why did you leave X for Y?"
- "What made you choose that path over alternatives?"
- "What were you trying to learn at that stage?"
- "What pulled you toward this industry/role/company?"

**The Range Connection:**
Farhan recommends David Epstein's book *Range*, which argues generalists often outperform specialists. The Life Story interview identifies generalists—people who've intentionally explored, not just climbed a single ladder.

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with transitions** - Career transitions are more revealing than accomplishments within a role. Ask about every major pivot.

2. **Look for learning motives** - Did they take the harder path because of who they'd work with? Did they optimize for learning over title?

3. **Probe the non-obvious choices** - Why a minor in electrical engineering on top of CS? Why financial engineering during an MBA? These reveal intentionality.

4. **Watch for "I just fell into it"** - Some randomness is fine, but consistent lack of intentionality is a signal.

5. **Connect to your company's needs** - Does their pattern of curiosity align with what you need? Curious, range-filled people adapt better to chaotic environments.

## What the Life Story Reveals

| Life Story Pattern | What It Suggests |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Consistently chose harder options | Growth-oriented, resilient |
| Sought out exceptional people | Learning-focused, good network |
| Explored multiple domains | Generalist, adaptable |
| Made decisions based on values | Self-aware, likely to stay if aligned |
| Followed prestige/compensation | May leave when better offer comes |
| Can't articulate why | Passive approach, less self-aware |

## The Deeper Insight

The Life Story interview is really asking: *Does this person have a framework for their career decisions, even if they can't articulate it explicitly?*

Farhan himself has an explicit framework for job decisions, and he's resigned immediately when roles violated it. People with strong internal frameworks make better long-term hires—they know what they want and will stay if you provide it.
