# Pi-Shaped Marketer

> "You want to hire pie shaped marketers, not pie like dessert, but pie like 3.14 where the pie symbol has two vertical lines. So like a T but it has an extra line." - Emily Kramer

## What It Is

A framework for hiring early-stage marketing talent that goes beyond the common "T-shaped" model. While T-shaped people have one area of deep expertise plus broad working knowledge, Pi-shaped marketers have TWO areas of expertise—represented by the two vertical lines of the π symbol—plus broad working knowledge across the top.

This matters because early-stage marketing requires someone who can own multiple functions without support. A single-spike specialist can't handle the breadth required; a pure generalist lacks the depth to execute at quality.

## How It Works

### The Three Marketing Pillars
Emily identifies three core marketing archetypes:
1. **Product Marketing** - Positioning, messaging, launches, understanding product and audience
2. **Content Marketing** - Writing, storytelling, community, thought leadership
3. **Growth/Demand Gen Marketing** - Channels, data, optimization, paid, SEO, email

### Pi-Shaped Combinations
Your first marketer should be expert in one pillar, proficient in a second, and have working knowledge of the third:

| Combination | Expert In | Proficient In | Working Knowledge |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Product-Growth | Product Marketing | Growth Marketing | Content |
| Product-Content | Product Marketing | Content Marketing | Growth |
| Growth-Content | Growth Marketing | Content Marketing | Product |

### The Rare Combination
Content + Growth pi-shaped marketers are rare. Content is "one side of the brain" (creative, narrative) while Growth is "a whole other side" (data, optimization). These skillsets rarely combine naturally. The exception: someone who is exceptional at content distribution or SEO-focused content.

## How to Apply It

1. **Assess your current gaps**: Use the Fuel and Engine framework to identify what your team lacks most. This determines which pillar should be your "expert" spike.

2. **Evaluate candidates against three pillars**: For each candidate, score their expertise level:
   - Expert: Can own this function independently and make strategic decisions
   - Proficient: Can execute well and hire/manage contractors in this area
   - Working knowledge: Understands how it works and can collaborate effectively

3. **Prioritize the right combination**:
   - **Sales-driven companies**: Often need Product-Growth (product marketing expertise + demand gen proficiency)
   - **Product-led companies**: May need Product-Content (product marketing + content to fuel PLG)
   - **Avoid pure specialists**: Early stage requires too much breadth for single-spike hires

4. **Test for writing ability**: All first marketers need to write well. Product marketers become the copywriter for a long time. Test both short-form (headlines, emails) and long-form (blog posts, positioning docs).

## When to Use It

- **Hiring your first marketer**: Define the pi-shape you need before starting the search
- **Evaluating marketing candidates**: Score candidates against the three pillars
- **Planning marketing team growth**: Identify which pillar gaps to fill with subsequent hires
- **Promoting or developing marketers**: Help them identify which second spike to develop
