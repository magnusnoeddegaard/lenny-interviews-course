# First PM from Within

> "The first PM at every company has been someone who's either been an analyst or an engineer or a designer who's worked there already and they just move from their role to being a PM. Why? Because many cases, the role of the PM is actually to be the liaison between the founder, founders and the engineering team. And so it needs to be someone that the founders trust and the engineering team trusts." - Gokul Rajaram

## What It Is

First PM from Within is a hiring principle for startups: rather than recruiting an external product manager, promote someone already at the company - typically an analyst, engineer, or designer who has demonstrated PM-like qualities and has the trust of both founders and the engineering team.

This approach recognizes that the first PM role is fundamentally about being a trusted liaison, not about bringing in external processes. External PMs often get rejected "like an organ by the body" because they lack the cultural context and established trust needed to be effective.

## How It Works

### Why Internal Works Better

1. **Trust is pre-established** - The person already has relationships with founders and engineers
2. **Cultural fit is proven** - They understand how decisions get made
3. **Context is deep** - They know the product, customers, and technical constraints
4. **Process adoption is smoother** - Engineers accept new ways of working from a trusted insider

### Signs Someone Should Make the Transition

Look for an existing team member who demonstrates:
- **Curiosity** - They naturally ask questions about customers and problems
- **Customer centricity** - They think about user needs without being prompted
- **Communication skills** - They facilitate discussions and synthesize information
- **Problem-solving orientation** - They focus on problems, not just solutions
- **Cross-functional awareness** - They understand how different parts connect

### The Timing

Gokul suggests hiring your first PM when you have 8-10 engineers, but only if:
- The founder can no longer effectively play the PM role
- The engineering team needs someone dedicated to helping them solve the right problems
- The team is well-established enough that a PM can add value without disrupting

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify candidates early** - Before you need a PM, notice who on your team shows PM traits

2. **Coach during the transition** - Help them shift from their comfort zone (engineering, design, analysis) to customer problems and prioritization

3. **Watch for regression** - New PMs often revert to their previous discipline; push them toward customer conversations

4. **Provide mentorship** - Connect them with external PM mentors since they won't have internal role models

5. **Set up for success** - Give them explicit authority to talk to customers and make prioritization recommendations

6. **Check engineering sentiment** - Ask engineers directly if the PM is adding value; they'll be honest

## When to Use It

- You have 8-10 engineers and the founder can't play PM full-time
- Your engineering team is empowered but needs someone to help with customer context
- You have a team member showing strong PM traits
- You're concerned about cultural fit with external hires

## When to Consider External

- Your engineering team serves developers (they understand users well)
- You're building infrastructure (fewer PM needs)
- You've tried internal promotion and it hasn't worked
- You need someone to bring specific domain expertise

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Picking randomly** - Don't just pick any engineer; look for specific PM traits
2. **Skipping mentorship** - Internal PMs need guidance since they're learning on the job
3. **Not checking with engineers** - Engineering feedback is critical for assessing PM effectiveness
4. **Expecting immediate expertise** - Give them 6 months to grow into the role
