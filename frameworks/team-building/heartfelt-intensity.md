# Heartfelt Intensity

> "We want people that show up to our company with some fire in their belly, something that they are out to do. And for each person it's a little bit different. For some people it may be UI Craft details. For other people, it may be achieving double the performance with a quarter of the engineering headcount. Everyone has something, but they show up with this heartfelt intensity." - Josh Miller

## What It Is

Heartfelt Intensity is a hiring and team-building principle that prioritizes intrinsic motivation over skills or experience. Rather than looking for people who fit a specific mold or check certain boxes, you look for people who have genuine passion and something they're personally driven to accomplish.

This differs from typical "passion" hiring because it's not about passion for your company or product specifically—it's about people who have their own internal fire, their own thing they need to prove to themselves or the world. When you bring these people together on an ambitious, exciting challenge, they do remarkable work because they're not just working for a paycheck or a title—they're pursuing their own mission that happens to align with yours.

## How It Works

The framework has several key components:

1. **Personal drive varies by individual**: One person may be obsessed with UI craft details, another with engineering efficiency. The specific focus doesn't matter as much as the intensity of that focus.

2. **Fire in the belly**: People should arrive with internal motivation, not need to have it manufactured through company culture or incentives.

3. **Something to prove**: Many of the best contributors are people who've been successful elsewhere but want to do the defining work of their career—they're still hungry.

4. **Get out of their way**: Once you've hired people with heartfelt intensity and given them an exciting, ambitious prompt, your job is to remove obstacles, not manage them.

## How to Apply It

1. **Reframe interview questions**: Instead of "Why do you want to work here?", ask "What are you trying to accomplish in your career? What keeps you up at night?"

2. **Look for diverse manifestations**: Don't require everyone to be passionate about the same thing. A team with varied but intense focuses creates a well-rounded product.

3. **Evaluate past patterns**: Look for evidence of people pursuing difficult challenges for their own reasons, not just following obvious career paths.

4. **Provide an ambitious prompt**: Heartfelt intensity needs an outlet. Make sure your company's mission is exciting and ambitious enough to channel this energy.

5. **Trust and empower**: If you've hired correctly, intensive management becomes counterproductive. Let people run with their intensity.

## When to Use It

- When hiring for roles that require creativity, innovation, or sustained excellence
- When building a team culture from scratch (early-stage companies)
- When trying to attract senior talent who've already achieved conventional success
- When competing against larger companies for talent (you can't compete on salary, but you can compete on mission alignment)
