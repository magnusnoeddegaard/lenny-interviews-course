# Culture Add vs Culture Fit

> "I like to say culture add, because culture fit to me can actually be quite negative toward somebody who is the aberration." - Chip Conley

## What It Is

Culture Add vs Culture Fit is a reframing of how organizations think about hiring for cultural alignment. "Culture fit" suggests candidates must conform to existing norms—which can disadvantage people who are different due to demographics, background, or perspective. "Culture add" recognizes that diversity strengthens culture by bringing new perspectives, skills, and ways of thinking.

This framework doesn't abandon cultural alignment—you still need people who can work within the culture. But it shifts the question from "Do they fit in?" to "What unique value do they add?"

## How It Works

**Culture Fit (Traditional Approach)**
- Question: "Will this person blend in?"
- Risk: Homogeneity, exclusion of different perspectives
- Signal: "We need someone who fits our vibe"
- Outcome: Teams that think alike, potential for blind spots

**Culture Add (Improved Approach)**
- Question: "What will this person bring that we don't have?"
- Opportunity: Diversity of thought, new capabilities
- Signal: "We need someone who adds what we're missing"
- Outcome: Teams with complementary strengths

The key insight is that culture is not static—it should evolve. Each new hire is an opportunity to strengthen and expand culture rather than just replicate it.

## How to Apply It

1. **Define what the culture needs, not just what it has** - Before hiring, ask "What perspective or capability are we missing?" not just "Who feels like us?"

2. **Interview for alignment on values, not behaviors** - Core values should be non-negotiable, but behaviors and styles can vary. Someone who shares your values might express them very differently.

3. **Challenge the "airport test"** - Asking "Would I want to be stuck in an airport with this person?" often just selects for social similarity. Ask instead "Would this person help us see something we're missing?"

4. **Use structured interviews** - Reduce bias by evaluating candidates against specific criteria rather than gut feeling about "fit."

5. **Look for additive friction** - The best additions sometimes create productive friction by questioning assumptions or bringing different approaches.

6. **Examine resistance to candidates** - When someone is labeled "not a fit," probe deeper. Is the concern about values alignment, or about comfort with difference?

## When to Use It

- Designing hiring processes
- Reviewing interview feedback
- Auditing diversity in hiring outcomes
- Training hiring managers
- Challenging homogeneity on teams
