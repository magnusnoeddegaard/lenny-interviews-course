# Never More Than Double

> "We never more than doubled in a year. And that's been our guideline that we shouldn't more than double. And this might be something we change in the future that we actually might do less than that." - Karri Saarinen

## What It Is

Never More Than Double is a hiring constraint that caps annual team growth at 100%—doubling being the maximum. This deliberate restraint on scaling helps maintain culture, quality, and the effectiveness that comes from having a cohesive team of high-caliber people.

The philosophy stems from Linear's founders' experiences at high-growth companies, where they observed that rapid headcount expansion often creates more problems than it solves. Chaos, diluted culture, communication breakdowns, and quality issues frequently accompany hypergrowth.

Linear's approach is the inverse: stay small, hire exceptional people, give them scope, and resist the pressure to scale the team faster than necessary.

## How It Works

**The Constraints:**
- Never grow the team more than 2x in a single year
- Consider growing even slower than that when possible
- Hire slowly and deliberately at all stages

**Linear's actual trajectory:**
- First year: Hired zero people (stayed at 3 founders)
- Second year: Hired a few people
- Third year: Hired a few more
- Each year: Less than or equal to 2x growth

**Why it works:**
- Culture can be transmitted effectively when growth is gradual
- New hires can be properly onboarded and integrated
- Quality standards can be maintained
- The team remains cohesive and aligned
- Less management overhead and communication complexity

**The underlying philosophy:**
"You can actually build better with less people than you can with more people." The goal is not to minimize headcount arbitrarily, but to recognize that adding people has real costs beyond salary.

## How to Apply It

1. **Set explicit growth constraints** - Make the 2x rule (or your chosen limit) a real constraint, not just a guideline

2. **Resist pressure to scale** - Growth pressure comes from many sources: investors, opportunities, comparison to other companies. Have the discipline to say no.

3. **Increase bar, not headcount** - When work exceeds capacity, first ask: "Can we hire better people who do more?" before asking "Can we hire more people?"

4. **Give individuals more scope** - Instead of adding specialists, look for people who can take on broader responsibilities

5. **Be patient with growth** - The pressure to scale often comes from impatience. Trust that gradual growth builds a better foundation.

6. **Evaluate each hire's true necessity** - Before any hire, genuinely ask: "What happens if we don't make this hire?"

**What this enables:**
- Every person matters and is known to everyone
- Less time spent on coordination and communication
- Higher average quality of the team
- More ownership per person
- Simpler organizational structure

## When to Use It

**This approach suits:**
- Companies building for quality and craft
- Products where excellence matters more than features
- Founders who want to build for the long term
- Teams that prioritize retention over acquisition
- Leaders who've seen the downsides of hypergrowth

**Trade-offs to consider:**
- May limit speed of market capture
- Could miss time-sensitive opportunities
- Requires each person to be exceptional
- May not suit all business models or competitive contexts

**The Linear context:**
Linear is profitable with net negative burn (more cash than they've raised). They're not constrained to grow quickly by runway. This financial position enables the choice to grow slowly. Companies with different financial situations may face different constraints.

**Karri's observation:**
"Sometimes high growth, especially on the employee side, is not that great. It can create a lot of chaos or just messiness... it was always easier to work with a smaller team of very high quality people than with a very large team of more average people."
