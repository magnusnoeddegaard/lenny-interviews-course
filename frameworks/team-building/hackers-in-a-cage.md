# Hackers in a Cage

> "We'd have situations where we'd call people 'hackers in a cage,' where it's kind of obvious there'd be a business founder, business person, who had clearly convinced a programmer to join the team. They were given very little equity and just we called them 'programmers in a cage.' Does this hacker in a cage have any say in the company, the direction of the product? Because the programmer needs to have opinions." - Jessica Livingston

## What It Is

"Hackers in a Cage" is a red flag pattern identified by Y Combinator during founder evaluations. It describes a dysfunctional co-founder dynamic where a business-oriented founder has recruited a technical co-founder primarily as an executor, giving them minimal equity and no real voice in company strategy or product direction.

This pattern predicts co-founder conflict and startup failure because it creates a fundamental power imbalance that becomes unsustainable as the company grows and the technical work becomes more critical.

## How It Works

### Signs of the Pattern

**Equity Red Flags**:
- Dramatically unequal equity splits (e.g., 90/10, 95/5)
- Technical co-founder has equity similar to an early employee rather than a founder
- No clear justification for the imbalance

**Behavioral Signs in Interviews/Meetings**:
- Business founder does all the talking
- Technical founder defers on product questions they should own
- Business founder interrupts or speaks over technical founder
- Technical founder seems disengaged from strategic discussions

**Structural Issues**:
- Business founder controls all investor relationships
- Technical founder was recruited specifically for this idea (no shared history)
- Technical founder is treated as "the person who builds the thing"

### Why It's Problematic

1. **Resentment builds**: As the company grows and the technical work becomes more valuable, the caged founder realizes they're being undervalued

2. **Product suffers**: The person closest to the technology doesn't have influence over product direction

3. **The cage breaks**: Either the technical founder leaves (often at the worst time) or demands renegotiation, causing conflict

4. **Signals founder character**: A business founder willing to cage a technical co-founder often has other problematic behaviors

## How to Apply It

### For Investors Evaluating Founders

1. **Check equity splits** in applications - flag significant imbalances
2. **Ask about the split** in interviews: "Why is your equity structured this way?"
3. **Direct questions to the technical founder** about product vision and strategy
4. **Observe dynamics**: Who speaks? Who decides? Who defers?
5. **Ask about history**: "How did you two meet? How long have you worked together?"

### For Technical Founders Evaluating Opportunities

1. **Negotiate equity upfront** - if you're a co-founder, you should have meaningful equity
2. **Assess your voice**: Will you have real input on product direction?
3. **Watch for warning signs**: Does the business founder listen to your technical judgment?
4. **Consider history**: Do you trust this person? Have you worked together before?
5. **Get it in writing**: Equity agreements, vesting schedules, decision rights

### For Business Founders Building Teams

1. **Recognize the builder's value** - without the product, there is no company
2. **Equal partners, equal stakes** - the closer to 50/50, the better
3. **Involve technical co-founders in strategy** - they need to own the vision too
4. **Shared history reduces risk** - recruit co-founders you already know and trust
5. **Would you take this deal?** - if the roles were reversed, would you accept these terms?

## When to Use It

- Evaluating potential co-founders before starting a company
- Investor due diligence on founding team dynamics
- Diagnosing co-founder conflict in existing startups
- Advising technical talent on partnership opportunities
- Building founding team structures

## Nuances

- **Sometimes imbalance is justified**: If one founder has been working on the idea for years and brings the other in later, some imbalance may be appropriate
- **It's not just about equity**: A 50/50 split with a silenced co-founder is still a cage
- **The pattern goes both ways**: Though less common, business founders can also be "caged" by technical founders
- **Context matters**: In some cultures, different equity norms exist
