# Hire Mutts

> "We like to hire mutts. And I haven't yet figured out a term that comes off as more endearing, because it's meant to be very endearing... We want to hire people who have a multidisciplinary approach and view things as, 'I like to make things. Tell me how I contribute to making it.' And sometimes they may play the verbs of a PM and sometimes it may be something else." - Josh Miller

## What It Is

Hire Mutts is a hiring philosophy that prioritizes multidisciplinary, adaptable people over specialists with narrow expertise. The term "mutt" (like a mixed-breed dog) captures the idea of people whose backgrounds, skills, and approaches don't fit neatly into a single category.

The philosophy connects to how The Browser Company operates without traditional product managers. Instead of hiring PMs, they hire people who can do PM work when needed, but who fundamentally see themselves as "people who make things"—not as members of a specific discipline.

The ideal candidate has experience across multiple domains (engineering and data science, design and research, journalism and marketing) and approaches work with the mindset: "Tell me what we're trying to make, and I'll figure out how to contribute."

## How It Works

Key characteristics of "mutts":

1. **Multidisciplinary background**: They've worked in different roles, industries, or functions—and drew lessons from each

2. **Maker identity**: They identify as "someone who makes things," not as "a PM" or "a designer." The discipline is a tool, not an identity.

3. **Adaptive skill deployment**: They can shift between being a PM, analyst, researcher, or coordinator depending on what the project needs

4. **Beginner's mind**: Because they're not deeply attached to one way of doing things, they're more open to new approaches

5. **Low ego about role**: They don't need a specific title or territory—they need to contribute to something meaningful

Example: Rebecca at The Browser Company has a PhD from MIT in behavioral psychology, was a data scientist at Quora, was a software engineer at Stripe, and now effectively PMs their multi-player team. She doesn't fit any single box.

## How to Apply It

1. **Look at career arcs, not current titles**: Value people who've moved between domains over those who've optimized within one

2. **Interview for adaptability**: Ask "Tell me about a time you had to do something outside your expertise" rather than "How deep is your PM framework knowledge?"

3. **Reframe job descriptions**: Instead of "PM with 5+ years experience," try "Maker who can lead complex projects—background could include engineering, design, data, or operations"

4. **Create fluid role boundaries**: Give people permission to contribute outside their nominal role

5. **Use project-based assignments**: Let the nature of the project determine who leads, rather than organizational hierarchy

6. **Hire slowly, observe diversity**: Make sure you're not accidentally hiring the same type of mutt repeatedly—you want different mixtures

## When to Use It

- Early-stage companies where everyone needs to wear multiple hats
- Creative/craft-focused organizations where rigid roles limit output
- When building cross-functional teams without traditional hierarchies
- When you want to avoid PM vs Engineering vs Design silos
- When you believe the future of work is more fluid than traditional roles suggest

## Limitations

Josh Miller acknowledges this may not scale forever:

- At some point, specialists may become necessary
- Career development gets complicated without clear role ladders
- Some people genuinely want to go deep in one discipline

The approach is explicitly a prototype that they expect to evolve.
