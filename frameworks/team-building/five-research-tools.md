# Five Research Tools

> "The best researchers I think are first of all, multi method... I think they have five tools." - Judd Antin

## What It Is

The Five Research Tools framework defines the essential skills that make a great user researcher. Rather than being deep in just one methodology, the best researchers have a "Swiss army knife" of capabilities that allow them to choose the right method for each situation. If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

This framework is useful for hiring researchers, developing researcher skills, and understanding what capabilities a research team needs to be effective.

## How It Works

### Tool 1: Formative/Generative Research
- Looking ahead, innovation-focused, ethnographic
- Open-ended exploration to understand users and contexts
- Going into the field to observe real behavior
- Example: Visiting Airbnb hosts in their homes to understand their experience

### Tool 2: Evaluative Research
- Usability testing and product evaluation
- Assessing whether designs work as intended
- Testing specific interactions and flows
- The "micro" level of tactical research

### Tool 3: Survey Design
- Rigorous, scaled data collection
- The best way to get responses from large populations
- Requires craft - well-designed surveys yield actionable data, bad surveys yield noise
- More than just writing questions - includes sampling, analysis, interpretation

### Tool 4: Applied Statistics
- Basic quantitative analysis skills
- Understanding significance, confidence intervals, effect sizes
- Ability to engage with AB test results intelligently
- Can't participate in data-driven discussions without this foundation

### Tool 5: Technical Skills (SQL/Prompt Engineering)
- Ability to query data independently
- Running your own analyses without waiting for data science
- Increasingly: using AI/LLMs effectively for research tasks
- Self-sufficiency with dashboards and data tools

## How to Apply It

### For Hiring Researchers
1. **Give open-ended problems** - Present a juicy research question and see how they approach it
2. **Look for multi-method thinking** - A good answer usually involves multiple approaches: "Here's how we could do this in a day, a week, or a month"
3. **Probe for range** - Ask how they'd use different methods for the same problem
4. **Accept T-shaped profiles** - Individual researchers may be deeper in some areas, but should have basic competence across all five

### For Building Research Teams
1. **Map the team's capabilities** - Audit where you have depth and gaps across all five tools
2. **Hire for complement** - If you're heavy on qualitative, add quantitative strength
3. **Develop the full toolkit** - Create learning paths for researchers to build weaker areas

### For Researchers
1. **Self-assess honestly** - Which tools are strong? Which need development?
2. **Build the weak areas** - Take courses, pair with experts, practice deliberately
3. **Resist specialization** - The most impactful researchers can flex across methods

## When to Use It

- When hiring or interviewing user researchers
- When building or assessing a research team
- When planning individual researcher development
- When scoping research projects (what methods are available?)

## The Interview Question

"Think of a topic you had to explain lately that was the most complex, and then explain it to me like I'm five."

This tests whether a researcher can take complex information and communicate it clearly - a meta-skill that underpins all five tools.
