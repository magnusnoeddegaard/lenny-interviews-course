# CPTO Model

> "There should be no debates over what's best for product or what's best for engineering, what's best for design. It should be what is best for the organization at whole." - Claire Vo

## What It Is

The CPTO Model is an organizational design pattern where product, engineering, and design report to a single executive—the Chief Product and Technology Officer. This structure optimizes for the whole R&D organization rather than individual functions.

Claire Vo has operated in this model at multiple companies, running multi-hundred person engineering teams alongside product and design. She argues this isn't just about consolidating headcount—it fundamentally changes how decisions get made and eliminates unproductive debates between functions.

The model provides two key benefits: strategic alignment (no more "what's best for engineering" vs "what's best for product" debates) and CEO leverage (a single accountable executive for R&D investment).

## How It Works

**Key Requirements:**

1. **Technical depth is mandatory** - The CPTO must understand how software gets built at a technical level. This isn't about using broad leadership skills to manage engineering—it's about actually engaging with architecture, infrastructure, and platform decisions.

2. **Operational scale** - Engineering teams are larger than product teams (classic ratios apply). The leader must be comfortable with org design at scale, high-volume recruiting, and engineering-specific culture challenges.

3. **On-call mentality** - Unlike a pure CPO, a CPTO gets paged at 1 AM for production incidents. This operational responsibility is fundamentally different.

**Why It Works:**

- **Optimizes for the whole** - Decisions are made based on what's best for customers and business, not what's best for individual functions
- **CEO leverage** - R&D is expensive. Having one accountable executive simplifies governance
- **Eliminates internal friction** - No more product-engineering standoffs or negotiation over priorities

**When It's Appropriate:**

- CEO has the skills but not the bandwidth to manage both functions
- CEO's expertise is elsewhere (not technical/product)
- Organization has struggled with product-engineering alignment
- You can find a leader with both technical depth and product vision

## How to Apply It

1. **Assess candidate technical depth honestly** - The leader must be able to review PRDs and GitHub simultaneously, understanding both. Leadership skills alone won't work.

2. **Optimize around available talent** - Don't force this structure. If your CEO can hold product and engineering together effectively, or if you have strong separate leaders who collaborate well, that works too.

3. **Include design and data** - Don't neglect the smaller functions. Product, engineering, design, and data are all builders and should be treated as one team.

4. **Expect different operational challenges** - Engineering talent challenges are different from product. Recruiting volume, culture shaping, and performance management look different at scale.

5. **Define accountability clearly** - The CPTO owns business outcomes from R&D investment. Make this explicit.

## When to Use It

- When product and engineering are frequently misaligned
- When the CEO needs more leverage and fewer direct reports
- When you can find a rare leader with both technical depth and product sense
- When R&D spend is significant and needs unified accountability
- When evaluating your own career path toward CPTO roles
