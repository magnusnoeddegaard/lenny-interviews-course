# Sell Me This Pen (Product)

> "It's not 'Sell me this pen,' it's 'Sell me this app.' Give them time. Don't trap them. Have them feel like it's not a trap or spook them." - Jason Lemkin

## What It Is

"Sell Me This Pen" is a famous sales interview technique, but Jason Lemkin argues you should adapt it: don't have candidates sell a generic pen—have them sell *your actual product*. This reveals whether they can learn your product, articulate your value proposition, and connect with your customers' problems.

Before the 2020 hiring frenzy, almost every sales organization did this. Then desperation made companies skip it. The result: massive mis-hires.

## How It Works

**The Traditional "Sell Me This Pen":**
- Tests generic sales instincts
- Reveals whether someone can think on their feet
- Shows if they can identify buyer needs

**"Sell Me This App" (Better):**
- Tests whether they've done homework
- Reveals how deeply they can learn your product
- Shows if they understand your customer problems
- Predicts actual performance in your specific sale

## How to Apply It

### Setting It Up

1. **Don't surprise them** - This isn't a trap. Tell them in advance.
2. **Give them resources** - Share your explainer videos, webinars, customer testimonials
3. **Allow prep time** - Days or a week, depending on complexity
4. **Make it realistic** - Treat it like an actual demo, not a test

### Running the Demo

5. **Play the skeptical buyer** - Ask real objections you hear
6. **Go beyond basics** - Ask about integrations, competitors, edge cases
7. **See how they handle gaps** - Do they BS or admit and commit to follow-up?
8. **Evaluate problem framing** - Do they lead with your solution or customer pain?

### What to Evaluate

- **Preparation quality** - Did they watch videos, read docs, explore the product?
- **Customer problem framing** - Do they understand who buys and why?
- **Product depth** - Can they go beyond the first 10 questions?
- **Handling uncertainty** - How do they respond when they don't know?
- **Closing instinct** - Do they move toward next steps?

## The Prep Test

The demo reveals preparation ethic as much as sales skill:

> "I am shocked how many salespeople I have met, from SDR to SVP of sales, that by the time... they haven't even watched an explainer video yet."

If they won't do the work for an interview, they won't do the work for customers.

## What Good Looks Like

A strong candidate will:
- Articulate your customer's problem in their own words
- Explain your 10x feature (the thing that makes you different)
- Handle objections with substance, not deflection
- Admit gaps honestly: "I'd need to check with the team"
- Ask for next steps even in a mock demo

A weak candidate will:
- Describe your product in generic marketing terms
- Not know how basic features work
- BS through questions they can't answer
- Never watch available training materials
- End the demo without any closing motion

## Why This Works Better Than Generic Exercises

The generic pen test reveals:
- Basic sales instinct
- Quick thinking
- Persuasion style

Your product demo reveals:
- Preparation and work ethic
- Ability to learn complex products
- Customer empathy
- Whether they can actually succeed in *your* role

## Logistics

**For high-velocity SDR/AE hiring:**
- Can do it quickly in process
- 30-minute prep, 15-minute demo

**For senior AE/Director/VP hiring:**
- Give more time (days)
- Make it more substantial
- Include Q&A and objection handling

**For any candidate:**
- Never skip this step
- It's not a trick—be supportive
- The ones who nail it stand out immediately
