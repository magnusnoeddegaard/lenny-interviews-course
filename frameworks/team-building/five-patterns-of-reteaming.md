# Five Patterns of Reteaming

> "If you're in a fast-growing company or a shrinking company, look there, don't look at trying to fight the natural evolution... Reteaming is inevitable. We might as well get better at it because we're going to have to deal with it." - Heidi Helfand

## What It Is

The Five Patterns of Reteaming is a framework that identifies the five distinct ways teams change over time. Rather than treating all reorgs as the same, this framework helps leaders recognize which pattern they're dealing with and respond appropriately.

Traditional advice suggests keeping teams stable for optimal performance (forming, storming, norming, performing). But in fast-growing or changing companies, teams naturally morph and evolve. Fighting this natural evolution is futile—instead, understand the patterns and work with them.

The framework shifts the conversation from "reorgs are bad" to "team change is inevitable, so let's get better at it."

## How It Works

### The Five Patterns

1. **One by One** - Someone joins or leaves your company
   - The most common form of team change
   - Includes hiring, attrition, departures
   - Focus on belonging for new hires, coaching existing members through change

2. **Grow and Split** - A team grows bigger then splits into two or more teams
   - Natural pattern during growth
   - Signals: meetings take longer, decisions harder, work diverges, standups lose relevance
   - Trade-off: splitting creates dependencies that didn't exist before

3. **Merging** - Two or more teams combine into one
   - Opposite of grow and split
   - Common during downsizing, consolidation, or acquisitions
   - Creates integration challenges and cultural blending needs

4. **Isolation** - Start a new team off to the side with process freedom
   - Also called "innovation by isolation" or "beneficial silos"
   - Great for catalyzing new products, handling emergencies
   - Requires executive sponsorship and protection from distractions

5. **Switching** - Moving from one team to another within the company
   - Tied to learning, development, and fulfillment
   - Can be short-term or long-term
   - Creates knowledge redundancy and safety nets

## How to Apply It

When facing organizational change:

1. **Identify the pattern** - Which of the five patterns best describes your situation?

2. **Apply pattern-specific tactics**:
   - *One by One*: Help new hires feel belonging; visualize hiring opportunities; coach existing team through change
   - *Grow and Split*: Watch for signals (longer meetings, divergent work); accept you'll trade problems for new ones
   - *Merging*: Do "Story of Our Team" exercises to create shared history; align on vision for the future
   - *Isolation*: Separate location, executive protection, process freedom, clear decision authority
   - *Switching*: Enable pairing to build redundancy; create opportunities for people to work with different colleagues

3. **Time-box changes** - Don't let organizational design deliberations drag on. Be biased toward shorter timeframes.

4. **Be clear on decision rights** - Use frameworks like RIDE to clarify who's requesting, giving input, deciding, and executing.

## When to Use It

- During any organizational change (growth, shrinkage, restructuring)
- When planning team structure for a new initiative
- To diagnose why team performance has shifted
- When onboarding or offboarding team members
- To create healthy "safety valves" like switching opportunities

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Percentage allocation** - Assigning people to multiple projects (10% here, 20% there) creates context-switching pain
- **Poof, they're gone** - Making changes without communication creates anxiety and distrust
- **Spreading high performers** - Breaking up a high-performing team to "spread the magic" destroys the chemistry that made them great
