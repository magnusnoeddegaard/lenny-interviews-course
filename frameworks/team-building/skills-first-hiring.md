# Skills-First Hiring

> "We made a pretty big push in something we call skills-first hiring. This was the idea that we could translate people's experiences into a set of skills, and by that we could help them really start balancing the marketplace with a much different system." - Hari Srinivasan

## What It Is

Skills-First Hiring is an approach to talent acquisition that prioritizes a candidate's demonstrated skills and capabilities over their job titles, degree credentials, or exact previous experience. Instead of searching for someone who held the title "Customer Service Manager," you search for someone with negotiation skills, de-escalation abilities, and customer empathy.

This approach emerged at LinkedIn during COVID-19 when they observed a mismatched labor market: hospitality workers were unemployed while customer service roles went unfilled. The marketplace wasn't balancing because hiring managers were searching by titles, not recognizing that hospitality workers possessed ~70% of the skills needed for customer service roles.

## How It Works

The framework shifts hiring from **title-matching** to **skill-matching**:

**Traditional approach:**
- Search: "Customer Service Manager with 3+ years experience"
- Result: Only see people with that exact title

**Skills-first approach:**
- Search: "Negotiation + conflict resolution + customer communication"
- Result: See people from hospitality, retail, sales, and other fields who have those skills

LinkedIn built systems to:
1. Infer skills from people's work experiences
2. Allow recruiters to search and filter by skills (47% of recruiters now use this)
3. Enable candidates to add evidence/credentials against each skill
4. Show transferable skills between seemingly different roles

## How to Apply It

For **hiring managers**:
1. **Start with skills, not titles** - What capabilities does this role actually require?
2. **Identify transferable skills** - Which adjacent fields develop similar skills?
3. **Create skills-based job posts** - List required skills explicitly
4. **Evaluate skill evidence** - Look at work samples, projects, and credentials
5. **Be open to training** - If someone has 70% of skills, can you develop the rest?

For **job seekers**:
1. **Map your skills** - Translate every experience into discrete skills
2. **Add evidence** - Attach work products, recommendations, and credentials to each skill
3. **Target by industry** - If you lack functional experience, show industry knowledge
4. **Use skills language** - In applications, explicitly name the skills you bring

## When to Use It

- When traditional title-based searches aren't yielding quality candidates
- When you want to expand your talent pool to non-traditional backgrounds
- When hiring for roles that are emerging or don't have standardized titles
- When trying to increase diversity by removing credential bias
- When labor markets are tight and you need to find hidden talent
