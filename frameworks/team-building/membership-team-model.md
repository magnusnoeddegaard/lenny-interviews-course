# Membership Team Model

> "At the end of the day, what we're saying is if there is a human being, from the moment they touch our software or our products for the first time, to, if they have it last, we need to have a deep, genuine, ongoing relationship with them. And on day one, that may be 'customer success.' On day 37, that might be, 'I have a bug.' And on day 58, that may be, 'Hey, we're shipping the mobile app soon. What do you want from mobile?'" - Josh Miller

## What It Is

The Membership Team Model is an organizational structure that consolidates traditionally separate functions—customer support, customer success, user research—into a single team responsible for the entire relationship with users (called "members"). Instead of viewing these as different disciplines with different owners, you treat them as a unified journey of serving the same human being.

The insight comes from recognizing that users don't think of themselves as moving between "support" and "research" and "success." They just have an ongoing relationship with your product. Traditional organizational boundaries create silos that fragment this relationship and lose valuable context.

The model was inspired by Josh Miller's experience at Facebook, where the user research team was extraordinary but functioned as a service organization subservient to product teams. The Membership Team inverts this: user relationships are the primary organizing principle, not product features.

## How It Works

The team owns the full user journey, which includes:

1. **Onboarding/Success**: Helping new users understand and get value from the product
2. **Support**: Resolving bugs, issues, and questions
3. **Research**: Understanding user needs, testing new features, gathering feedback
4. **Ongoing relationship**: Maintaining dialogue with users over time

Key principles:

- **One team, one relationship**: The same team (though maybe different individuals) handles a user from first touch to ongoing engagement
- **Context accumulates**: Because the team sees the full journey, they understand users more deeply
- **Research is not a service**: The membership team has agency and influence, not just answering questions from product teams
- **Users are "members"**: The language reinforces that you're building a community, not just acquiring customers

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your current structure**: Map where user touchpoints currently live (support, success, research, community). Identify handoffs and information loss.

2. **Start with the human**: Instead of "what team handles support?", ask "who owns the relationship with this person?"

3. **Consolidate gradually**: You may not be able to merge everything immediately. Start by having teams share context and eventually reporting lines.

4. **Hire relationship-focused people**: Look for people who think holistically about users, not just specialists in support or research.

5. **Give the team influence**: Membership insights should shape product decisions, not just inform them. Include membership leaders in product planning.

6. **Change the vocabulary**: Call users "members." Call the work "membership," not "support." Language shapes thinking.

## When to Use It

- When building products that depend on strong user relationships
- When your support, success, and research teams seem siloed
- When important user insights get lost between teams
- When you want to elevate user research from a service function
- When user retention and engagement are critical metrics
