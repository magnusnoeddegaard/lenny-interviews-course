# Harder to Sell Heuristic

> "Trust... got to hire someone whose last product was harder to sell." - Jason Lemkin

## What It Is

The Harder to Sell Heuristic is a critical filter for evaluating sales candidates: always hire people whose previous product was harder to sell than yours. If their last product was easier to sell, they won't have developed the skills needed for your more challenging sale—and they'll fail.

This is one of the most common mistakes founders make when hiring salespeople. Someone can be very successful in one environment and completely fail in another.

## How It Works

**The Principle:**
- Someone who learned to sell a harder product brings more skills
- Someone who came from an easier product brings fewer skills than needed
- Skills don't transfer upward—they transfer downward

**Why This Happens:**
When a product is easy to sell, reps develop habits that don't work for harder sales:
- Relying on the brand to do the work
- Handling only 10 basic objections
- Not learning to go deep on technical questions
- Not developing persistence for long sales cycles

When they move to something harder, these gaps become fatal.

## What Makes a Product Harder to Sell?

**More Technical**
- Selling to VPs of Engineering instead of business buyers
- Products requiring deep integration knowledge
- APIs, developer tools, infrastructure

**More Competitive**
- #4 player in a crowded market vs. category leader
- No clear brand advantage
- Requires explaining differentiation constantly

**More Complex Business Process**
- Products requiring organizational change
- Multiple stakeholders involved
- Long implementation periods
- Significant behavior change required

**Less Trusted Category**
- New categories with skeptical buyers
- Products in traditionally on-premise industries
- Security-sensitive or compliance-heavy sales

## The Sam Blond Example

Jason Lemkin's first SDR was Sam Blond (later CRO at Brex, partner at Founders Fund). Before joining, Sam sold for Intacct (online financials). In those days, financial data was the last thing companies wanted in the cloud. It was an extremely difficult sale.

When Sam came to sell electronic signatures—still hard, but less hard—he said: "This is much easier than Intacct." He went from SDR to SMB AE to mid-market AE to director of sales to head of sales. The harder product had prepared him for everything.

## How to Apply It

### Evaluating Backgrounds

1. **Map their previous sale** - How technical? How competitive? How complex?
2. **Compare to yours** - Is your sale harder or easier?
3. **Look for #4 players** - Someone who succeeded at the #4 company can crush it at #2
4. **Be wary of category leaders** - They had brand advantage you don't have

### During Interviews

5. **Ask about objections** - What were the hardest ones? How did they handle them?
6. **Explore competitive positioning** - How did they win against stronger brands?
7. **Test technical depth** - Can they go beyond the basic 10 questions?
8. **"Sell me this pen"** - Have them demo your actual product

### Red Flags

- "The product sold itself at my last company"
- Very short sales cycles at previous company
- Heavy reliance on brand name (Salesforce, Google, etc.)
- Limited experience with technical buyers
- No experience with multi-stakeholder deals

## B2B vs. B2D Warning

A specific version of this principle: B2B reps often fail in B2D (business to developers) environments.

Selling to VPs of Engineering is different:
- They don't suffer fools
- They need technical depth
- They can spot product bullshit instantly
- The pitch that works on business buyers fails

If your sale is technical, be very cautious hiring from pure business-process companies.

## The Flip Side

The heuristic also works in reverse: if you hire someone from a *much* harder sale, they might:
- Be overqualified and get bored
- Over-complicate your simpler sale
- Bring more process than you need

Ideal: a smidge harder, not dramatically harder.
