# A Method for Hiring

> "Most founders are really bad at hiring. They fall prey to all sorts of pretty common human biases." - Jonathan Lowenhar

## What It Is

Based on the book *Who: The A Method for Hiring* by Geoffrey Smart and Randy Street, this framework represents the operationalized and expanded methodology that Jonathan Lowenhar uses with founders at Enjoy The Work. The core insight is that most founders approach hiring like gambling—"oh cool, they worked at Meta and Salesforce already, so hire them"—rather than using a systematic approach to predict success.

The three pillars of effective hiring are: (1) look for people who have already done the specific thing you need done, (2) look for people who have been "pulled" through their career by raving fans, and (3) verify alignment with your core values.

Most critically, hiring should never start with a job description. It should start with outcomes: "It's 12 months later, you hired the person, you're clinking champagne because of how great it's been. What changed about the business?"

## How It Works

**Three Core Hiring Criteria:**

**1. They've Done It Before**
- Start with outcomes, not job descriptions
- Define what success looks like in 12 months
- Look for candidates who have already achieved those specific outcomes
- "Done it before" should be interpreted creatively for junior roles (selling Girl Scout cookies counts as sales experience)

**The Mistake:** "I need a PM" → Write job description → Hope for the best
**The Method:** "I need these features shipped" → What would change → Who has done that → Hire them

**2. History of Creating Raving Fans (Pulled vs. Pushed)**
- People who were outstanding performers get "pulled" into their next opportunity
- Someone from Job A recruits them into Job B, then someone from Job B pulls them into Job C
- Great performers rarely do job searches—they're recruited by people who loved working with them
- Pattern of being pulled = high likelihood of exceptional performance

**Screening Question:** "Of your last bosses, how many would get on the phone and say you're amazing?"
- Any equivocation in the answer = move on

**3. Core Values Match**
- Culture is the codification of what matters + ritualization of living those values
- Values emanate from founders but need to be systematically evaluated in hiring
- Some people are natural embodiments of your values—use them for culture interviews regardless of title
- A "culture interview" should be separate from functional or technical interviews

## How to Apply It

**Step 1: Define Success (Before You Hire)**
- "It's 12 months later, what changed about the business?"
- Document the specific outcomes you need
- Don't create a job description—create a success profile

**Step 2: Work Backwards to Resources**
- What work needs to be done to achieve those outcomes?
- What resources (human and otherwise) are required?
- Now you know what kind of person you need

**Step 3: Structure Your Interview Process**
Three separate interview types:
1. **Culture Interview** - Do they embody our values? (Use your best culture ambassadors)
2. **Functional Interview** - Have they done this specific work before?
3. **Technical Interview** - Do they have required skills?

**Step 4: Verify the "Pull" Pattern**
- Look for evidence of being recruited by former colleagues
- Ask directly about boss relationships
- Back-channel reference checks on this specifically

**Step 5: Treat Adults Like Adults**
- Once hired, agree on what success looks like
- Give resources and autonomy
- Don't micromanage—check in when there are questions
- Reserve structure and supervision for those who need it

## When to Use It

- Every time you hire (especially executives)
- When your recent hires haven't worked out
- When redesigning your interview process
- When founders are making gut-feel hiring decisions
- When scaling requires more systematic approaches
- When your team doesn't feel cohesive or values-aligned
