# Single-Threaded Leader

> "Let's create teams that can stand alone, where there's a single leader and the cross-functional resources that they need are all either directly report to them or are dedicated to them." - Bill Carr

## What It Is

Single-Threaded Leadership is Amazon's organizational model where one leader and their team are fully responsible for one product, service, or area. Instead of having resources shared across multiple initiatives and projects, each team has dedicated cross-functional resources (engineering, design, marketing, etc.) that either report directly to the leader or are fully dedicated to them.

This model emerged at Amazon during 2004-2007 when the company grew complex enough that the CEO could no longer be in every important meeting or involved in every hire. The company needed a system to maintain speed, ownership, and agility at scale.

The model replaces the traditional "project orientation" (resources swarm on projects then move elsewhere) with a "program orientation" (a dedicated team always works on one area and thinks holistically about it).

## How It Works

**The Three Things It Delivers:**
1. **Ownership** - Clear accountability for outcomes
2. **Speed** - No waiting for shared resources
3. **Agility** - Teams can move quickly without coordination overhead

**Key Characteristics:**
- The leader owns a coherent scope (a product, service, or defined area)
- Cross-functional resources are dedicated (straight-line or dotted-line reports)
- The team has metrics they can control and improve
- They run their own roadmap and prioritization
- Success or failure depends on the team, not on external coordination

**From the Interview:**
Bill Carr gives the example of Amazon's Prime Video: they could create single-threaded teams for:
- TV set applications (Samsung, Sony)
- Game consoles (Xbox, PlayStation as separate teams)
- Mobile phones and tablets (iOS as its own team)

Each team has clear ownership and can operate autonomously.

## How to Apply It

**Step 1: Evaluate your prerequisites**
Before implementing single-threaded leadership, you need:
- A service-based architecture (not a monolithic codebase)
- Well-defined APIs and endpoints between teams
- Clear scope boundaries

**Step 2: Define the scope**
Ask three questions:
1. Does this team have resources to effectively manage this area?
2. Can they control the metrics that matter for their area?
3. Is the scope coherent (not too narrow, not too broad)?

**Step 3: Assign dedicated resources**
Move from shared resource pools to dedicated teams:
- Engineering reports to (or is dedicated to) the leader
- Design, marketing, biz dev follow the same pattern
- Generalist leader manages cross-functional team

**Step 4: Shift management's role**
Senior leadership referees:
- Which teams have how many resources (1-3x per year decision)
- NOT every item on every roadmap (daily firefighting)

**Step 5: Implement countermeasures for functional excellence**
The trade-off: generalist leaders may not be experts in every function they manage.

Countermeasures include:
- Central functional leaders who set standards (e.g., CTO sets engineering practices)
- Cross-team promotion panels
- Code review available across organizations
- Subject matter experts have "extra jobs" beyond their day job

## When to Use It

**Good fit:**
- Companies past the hyper-growth, zero-to-one phase
- Complex organizations with multiple product lines
- Teams competing for centralized resources
- When "planning meetings" consume more time than building

**Not a fit:**
- Pre-product-market-fit companies (different problems)
- Very small teams where everyone does everything
- When you can't yet define clear scope boundaries

## The Trade-off

There's no free lunch in org structures. You're trading:

**Gaining:**
- Ownership and accountability
- Speed (no resource contention)
- Clear success/failure attribution

**Risking:**
- Functional excellence (no central expert coaching each function)
- Duplication of effort across teams
- Potential for inconsistent practices

The countermeasures (central standards, cross-team reviews, functional communities) mitigate the downsides.
