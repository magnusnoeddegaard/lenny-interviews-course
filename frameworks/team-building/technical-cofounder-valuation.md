# Technical Co-Founder Valuation Test

> "You applied to YC and you have 90% for yourself and 10% for the engineer. You're basically saying that like, 'Oh, the engineering part of this company is only worth 1/10th of me. I'm the non-technical person.' So that to me is a signal that you're not really valuing engineering." - Gustaf Alstromer

## What It Is

The Technical Co-Founder Valuation Test is Gustaf Alstromer's diagnostic for assessing whether non-technical founders truly understand the value of engineering in building a technology company. The test is simple: look at the equity split between a non-technical founder and their technical partner.

A highly skewed split (like 90/10) reveals that the non-technical founder views engineering as a service to be purchased rather than a core creative function of the company. This mindset predicts failure.

## How It Works

### The Song Analogy

Gustaf's friend Paul provides the perfect frame:

"I have an idea for a song, I just need a musician to help me make it."

This statement reveals a fundamental misunderstanding: the music IS the song. Similarly, the code IS the product. Having an "idea" for a product without the ability to build it is not having a product at all.

### What Equity Splits Reveal

**90/10 split** signals:
- Engineering is viewed as execution, not creation
- The "idea person" believes they're more valuable
- Technical work is seen as a service to be purchased
- Likely to struggle attracting top engineering talent

**50/50 split** (or close) signals:
- Recognition that building is as valuable as conceiving
- Technical co-founder is a true partner, not an employee
- Understanding that iteration (building) creates the product
- More likely to attract and retain engineering talent

### Why Engineering Value Gets Underestimated

Gustaf explains: "The truth is that the engineering part is the really hard part."

Non-technical founders often believe:
- The hard part is having the idea
- Engineers "just" implement specifications
- A contractor could do it as well as a co-founder

The reality:
- Iteration is where products are created
- Technical decisions shape what's possible
- Speed of building determines survival
- Engineers who feel like partners work harder

## How to Apply It

### For Non-Technical Founders

Before approaching potential technical co-founders:

1. **Internalize the value** - Accept that building IS creating
2. **Offer equal equity** - 50/50 or close to it
3. **Seek partnership, not service** - Find someone who wants to build this with you
4. **Learn some code** - Even basic understanding shows respect for the craft

### For Technical Founders Evaluating Partners

Use equity offers as a filter:
- A 90/10 offer reveals how they'll treat you
- Ask about their view of engineering's role
- Assess whether they see you as partner or employee

### For YC Applications

YC specifically screens for this:

"We aren't accepting a whole lot of teams that don't know how to build or get their first prototype built themselves because we know it is a super common failure pattern."

Non-technical founders who can't attract equal partners often can't attract any partners.

## Alternatives to Technical Co-Founders

Gustaf acknowledges cases where non-technical founders succeed:

1. **Build a founding-level engineering team** - Give significant equity, make them feel like founders
2. **Learn to code yourself** - Build the first prototype, hire engineers later
3. **Find someone who wants to do this specific thing** - Technical co-founders also want business partners

What doesn't work:
- Contracting firms (they're not invested in iteration)
- 10% engineers (they'll leave for better opportunities)
- Specs-to-code services (products aren't built from specs)

## Why Iteration Requires Ownership

"So many of the decisions you're going to make are technical and so many of the iterations you're going to make relies on engineering. And if you don't understand that, you won't actually make the right decisions anyway."

Products evolve through building, not planning. A technical partner who feels ownership:
- Makes better architectural decisions
- Works harder on difficult problems
- Stays through the hard parts
- Iterates faster because they care
