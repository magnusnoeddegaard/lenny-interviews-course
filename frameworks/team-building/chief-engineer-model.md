# Chief Engineer Model

> "The most important thing you have to do in a product is make trade-off decisions. If you just let people make their own trade-off decisions, you can't have any kind of coherent design thrust." - Eric Ries

## What It Is

The Chief Engineer Model comes from Toyota's production system. It assigns a single person with moral authority over an entire product line—from conception to production—to make all trade-off decisions. Crucially, this person has no direct reports. They lead through influence, expertise, and the clarity of their vision.

The key insight is that products fail when trade-off decisions are distributed across many people or committees. Someone must be empowered to say "this button must be metal" or "we're accepting this cost to get this benefit" with authority that others respect.

## How It Works

### The Role

At Toyota, the chief engineer has:
- **Full authority** over all design and trade-off decisions for a product
- **No direct reports**—people work on the product but don't report to them
- **A small staff** and "the big room" where product decisions are made
- **Moral authority** earned through expertise and judgment

The product is even named after the chief engineer internally. It's not called "Toyota Camry"—it's called "so-and-so san's car."

### The Structure

- The team working on a product swells during design and shrinks during production
- The chief engineer stays constant through the entire lifecycle
- When there's a conflict between departments, the chief engineer decides
- The decision stands because everyone respects the chief engineer's judgment

### Why It Works

1. **Trade-offs require unity**: When someone asks "should we improve aerodynamics if it means this button becomes plastic?", there must be one person who knows the answer.

2. **Design coherence**: Products with distributed decision-making feel like compromises. Products with unified vision feel designed.

3. **Speed**: Debates are resolved quickly by one authority, not through committees.

4. **Accountability**: Success or failure clearly belongs to one person.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify the chief engineer role** for each major product or initiative. This might be a PM, but could also be a founder, designer, or technical lead.

2. **Grant moral authority without formal reports**: The chief engineer doesn't need to manage people—they need decision rights. Make this explicit.

3. **Create the "big room"**: Establish a physical or virtual space where product decisions are made with the chief engineer present.

4. **Respect the decisions**: Leadership must back the chief engineer's calls, even when others disagree. The system only works if authority is real.

5. **Select for judgment**: The chief engineer role requires deep product taste, technical understanding, and the ability to see the whole picture.

## When to Use It

- When your product feels like a compromise between departments
- When trade-off decisions take too long or keep getting revisited
- When you have the right person with deep expertise and good judgment
- When you want to empower founders within your organization

## Comparison to Other Models

**vs. PM as product owner**: Many PMs have responsibility without authority. The chief engineer has authority without direct reports.

**vs. Committee decisions**: Committees distribute accountability and create compromises. The chief engineer creates coherence.

**vs. Single-Threaded Leader**: The STL model (from Amazon) gives both authority AND organizational control. The chief engineer model separates moral authority from org chart power.
