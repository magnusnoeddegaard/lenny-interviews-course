# Fast Thinking / Slow Thinking Teams

> "We now have what I call the fast thinking group, which officially is called AI platform, but it really means we want to just ship a bunch of new capabilities on a near weekly basis. And each of them should be truly awesome value. You should drop your jaw, how awesome it is to use this new capability... Then separately, we have the slow thinking group, and that's not meant to be better or worse. It's literally like you need fast and slow thinking in the common sense to operate as a human." - Howie Liu

## What It Is

Fast Thinking / Slow Thinking Teams is an organizational structure inspired by Daniel Kahneman's "Thinking, Fast and Slow" applied to product development. It recognizes that different types of work require fundamentally different modes of operation, and trying to do both in the same team creates friction.

Rather than organizing by feature area or business unit, this model creates two distinct groups with different mandates, timelines, and operating modes—one optimized for rapid iteration and another for careful, deliberate architecture.

## How It Works

**Fast Thinking Group (System 1)**
- Ships new capabilities on a weekly basis
- Focuses on AI features and rapid experimentation
- Operates like an AI-native startup (think Cursor or Windsurf)
- Success metric: jaw-dropping value delivered each week
- Attracts entrepreneurial people who thrive in ambiguity

**Slow Thinking Group (System 2)**
- Handles work requiring careful planning and premeditation
- Builds infrastructure, scalability, and enterprise features
- Success metric: reliability, scale, and architectural soundness
- Work that can't be "shipped in a week in a hacky prototype"

**How They Complement Each Other**
- Fast thinking creates top-of-funnel excitement and new use cases
- Slow thinking enables those seeds to grow into durable deployments
- Fast inspires what's possible; slow makes it reliable
- AI-native companies often struggle to convert fast wins into durable growth—the slow team solves this

## How to Apply It

Steps for implementing this structure:

1. **Audit your current work** - Categorize existing projects by whether they benefit from speed vs. deliberation
2. **Create distinct teams** - Separate fast and slow work into different groups with different leaders
3. **Set different expectations** - Fast team ships weekly; slow team ships quarterly with architecture reviews
4. **Hire differently** - Fast team needs entrepreneurial, full-stack builders; slow team needs systematic thinkers
5. **Coordinate at interfaces** - Define how fast work transitions to slow team for productionization

## When to Use It

This structure is most valuable when:

- You're in a rapidly evolving technology landscape (like AI)
- Your company has both innovation needs AND scaling/reliability needs
- Previous org structures created friction between "move fast" and "do it right" factions
- You're trying to compete with AI-native startups while serving enterprise customers

It may not fit if:
- Your company is small enough that everyone works on everything
- Your market is stable and doesn't require rapid innovation
- All your work genuinely requires the same operating mode
