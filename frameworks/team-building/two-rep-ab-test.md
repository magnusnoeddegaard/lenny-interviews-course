# Two Rep A/B Test

> "You've got to hire two because otherwise, there's no A-B test. You have to A-B test humans." - Jason Lemkin

## What It Is

The Two Rep A/B Test is a principle for building your first sales team: never hire just one salesperson. Always hire at least two. The reason is simple: you need a control group. With one rep, you don't know if poor results are due to the rep, your product, your market, or bad luck. With two reps, you can start to see patterns.

This isn't about competition—it's about learning. Your first sales hires will teach you what works, what doesn't, and what kind of people you need.

## How It Works

**The Problem with One Rep**
- If they fail, you don't know why
- If they succeed, you don't know if it's replicable
- You can't distinguish personality effects from process effects
- You have no baseline for performance expectations

**What Two Reps Give You**
- Comparison data on approach and style
- Pattern recognition across wins and losses
- Ability to identify who needs support vs. who's a mismatch
- Foundation for building your playbook

## How to Apply It

### Before Hiring

1. **Set the expectation with your board/investors** - Budget for two hires, not one
2. **Accept the investment** - Yes, it's twice the salary risk upfront
3. **Run the same interview process** - You want comparable candidates
4. **Don't settle for one great one** - Wait until you have two you'd buy from

### After Hiring

5. **Give them equal leads** - Fair distribution lets you compare fairly
6. **Observe differences in approach** - Who emails more? Who calls? Who demos differently?
7. **Track the same metrics** - Calls, demos, close rates, deal sizes
8. **Manage them as a founder** - You're the crummy first head of sales

### What to Learn

- Which pitch variations work?
- Which objection handlers succeed?
- What's the ideal demo flow?
- What types of customers convert best?

## The Math Makes Sense

In the very early days, you might think you can't afford two reps. But consider:

- A single rep costs ~$70K base (at 50/50 split of $140K OTE)
- Two reps cost ~$140K base for three months of learning
- That's ~$35K additional investment for comparative data
- The learnings can be worth millions in avoided mistakes

If you hire one rep and they fail after three months, you've lost three months AND have no idea why. If you hire two and one fails, you at least know what success looks like.

## When You Need Just One (Rare Cases)

There are situations where one rep might be acceptable:
- You're testing if sales works at all for your model
- You have extreme budget constraints
- You're hiring a player-coach who will build the team

But even then, plan to add a second quickly. The A/B learning is too valuable to skip.

## Founder Involvement Required

With two reps, the founder must actively manage:
- You're figuring out the playbook together
- You need to be on calls to understand what's working
- You're building the first sales process, not delegating it
- This is temporary—do it until you have a real pattern

## The Transition to VP of Sales

The Two Rep A/B Test is also how you know when you're ready for a VP of Sales:

- When both reps are hitting quota
- When you understand what's working
- When you have a script that's starting to repeat
- When leads are coming in consistently

Only then should you bring in a VP to scale from rep 3 to rep 300.
