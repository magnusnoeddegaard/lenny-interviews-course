# Innovation Team Structure (GitHub Next Model)

> "What happens in teams that are not successful, at least from what I've seen, one, that the team is becoming basically a university, they write papers, but nothing is coming out of that, so nothing finds its way to production." - Inbal Shani

## What It Is

The Innovation Team Structure framework describes how to organize research and innovation teams so they actually produce shippable products rather than just academic outputs. Based on GitHub's "GitHub Next" team that created Copilot, this framework addresses why most corporate innovation teams fail: disconnection from production reality.

Many companies create innovation labs, skunkworks teams, or research groups that operate in isolation. These teams often produce impressive prototypes and research papers but struggle to translate their work into shipping products. The framework identifies two failure modes and provides countermeasures:

**Failure Mode 1: The University** - Teams become disconnected from production concerns, producing interesting research that never ships.

**Failure Mode 2: The Tactical Team** - Teams get pulled into near-term work ("We need something in six months. Go invent it right now.") and lose their ability to think about longer horizons.

GitHub's model avoids both by maintaining strong connections between the research team, product organization, and engineering while protecting the team's mandate to think 3-5 years ahead.

## How It Works

The framework operates on several structural principles:

**1. Production Path from Day Zero**
When thinking about a new idea, immediately consider how it gets to production. This doesn't mean compromising the research—it means the path to shipping is always part of the conversation.

**2. Strong Product Integration**
The research team maintains active, ongoing relationships with product and engineering teams. Ideas flow both directions: research insights inform product strategy, and product needs inform research priorities.

**3. Horizon Protection**
The team's mandate explicitly covers 3-5 year thinking. They're not solving this quarter's problems—they're inventing the future. This protection must be actively maintained against the gravitational pull of tactical needs.

**4. Right People, Right Mindset**
The team comprises applied scientists and research scientists who can bridge academic thinking with practical application. They need both the creativity to imagine new possibilities and the engineering sense to build working prototypes.

**5. Organic Spark Preservation**
Innovation isn't scheduled. The team structure should encourage creative exploration rather than trying to systematize ideation ("Imagine that someone says you have 15 minutes a day to be creative. I don't think it works.").

## How to Apply It

1. **Connect research to product leadership** - Ensure direct lines of communication between research teams and product strategy. At GitHub, "there is a strong relationship, especially between the product team and GitHub Next."

2. **Define the time horizon explicitly** - Make clear that the team thinks 3-5 years out. This prevents tactical pull while setting expectations for what kind of output to expect.

3. **Require working prototypes** - Don't just produce papers and presentations. Build things that work, even if roughly. Copilot started as experiments with GPT, not a strategy deck.

4. **Feed the research with customer input** - Research teams should have access to customer conversations and feedback. "A lot of the innovative ideas are coming basically from conversation with customers."

5. **Allow ideas from everywhere** - Don't limit innovation to the research team. "In GitHub, innovation is coming from everywhere—the field team, the product team, the design team, the engineering team."

6. **Test internally first** - GitHub tests everything internally before releasing to customers. "Nothing is shipped before it spends enough months cooking inside GitHub."

## When to Use It

This framework applies when:

- Establishing corporate innovation or research functions
- Restructuring struggling innovation teams
- Evaluating why innovation efforts aren't producing results
- Designing the interface between research and product organizations
- Scaling innovation practices across a larger organization

The key insight is that innovation teams fail more often from organizational structure problems than from lack of ideas or talent.
