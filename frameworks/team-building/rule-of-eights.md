# Rule of Eights

> "There's rules of eight. Eight SDRs, outbound reps need one manager. Eight AEs, eight sales execs need a director above them." - Jason Lemkin

## What It Is

The Rule of Eights is the structural principle for scaling sales organizations. Every layer of sales management can effectively manage eight direct reports. This simple ratio lets you plan your entire sales org from two reps to two hundred.

Unlike some roles where span of control can vary widely, sales is remarkably consistent at 1:8 across company stages and segments.

## How It Works

**The Layers:**
- 8 SDRs (Sales Development Reps) → 1 SDR Manager
- 8 AEs (Account Executives) → 1 Sales Director/Manager
- 8 Directors → 1 VP (though you rarely have 8 directors)

**Why Eight?**
- SDRs need high-frequency coaching and call reviews
- AEs need weekly deal reviews and pipeline management
- Managers can meaningfully know 8 deals/8 people
- Beyond 8, quality of management degrades

**Building Your Org Chart:**
You can literally build your entire sales organization with this rule:
- 2 AEs: Founder manages them
- 8 AEs: Need first sales manager
- 16 AEs: Need two managers + VP
- 64 AEs: Two directors + eight managers + VP

## How to Apply It

### Knowing When to Add Layers

1. **First 2 reps** - Founder manages directly
2. **Reps 3-8** - VP of Sales arrives, manages the team
3. **Reps 9-16** - VP brings in first two directors/managers
4. **Reps 17+** - Continue pattern with 8:1 ratio

### Hiring Managers

5. **50% internal promotion** - Grow your best reps into managers
6. **50% external hire** - Bring in fresh perspectives and experience
7. **Look for player-coaches** - Managers should still be in deals
8. **Avoid pure process managers** - They disconnect from the front lines

### Common Mistakes

- Adding managers before you have 8 reps (too early overhead)
- Stretching managers to 12+ reports (quality suffers)
- Promoting top rep before they're ready
- Hiring VP before you have two reps hitting quota

## Why There Are No Efficiencies at Scale

Unlike engineering or product, sales doesn't get more efficient as you scale:

- Half your company will be in sales at 10M ARR
- Half your company will be in sales at 50M ARR
- Half your company will be in sales at 100M ARR

Public companies often have *higher* CACs than startups because they've saturated easier customers. There are almost anti-efficiencies in sales scaling.

## SDRs: The 8-12 Debate

For a while, companies pushed SDR manager ratios to 12:1, thinking SDRs were "high velocity" and needed less management. Most have reverted to 8:1:

> "Fewer SDRs having better conversations"

The savings from higher ratios don't offset the quality degradation.

## When Your Stretch VP Breaks

The Rule of Eights also predicts when your VP of Sales might fail. A "stretch VP" (promoted from director) typically scales with the team if they can hire strong managers under them.

Signs they're breaking:
- Can't attract external manager talent
- Only promoting junior internal reps
- Micromanaging deals instead of building leaders
- Organization lacks second-level depth

The solution isn't always replacing them—sometimes it's hiring stronger directors beneath them.
