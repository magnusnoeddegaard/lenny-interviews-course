# Innovation by Isolation

> "A team was created off to the side and they were given process freedom. They worked in more of a daily sprint style as opposed to the two-week sprint style... We got to deploy more frequently." - Heidi Helfand

## What It Is

Innovation by Isolation is the practice of creating a "beneficial silo"—a small team separated from the main organization with the freedom to work differently. This approach accelerates innovation by removing the process drag that accumulates in mature product teams.

The framework recognizes that existing product cadences optimize for stability and reliability, which works against the rapid iteration needed for new product development. Rather than fighting the system, you create a parallel system with different rules.

## How It Works

### The Isolation Model

An isolated team has:
- **Separate location** - Their own physical or virtual space
- **Process freedom** - Can work at whatever cadence makes sense (daily sprints vs. bi-weekly)
- **Executive sponsorship** - Reports to a senior leader with decision-making authority
- **Protection from distraction** - Other teams are told not to pull them into other work
- **Focused mission** - A clear problem to solve or product to build

### Why It Works

When teams work on existing products, they inherit:
- Established development processes and cadences
- Technical debt and legacy systems
- Cross-team dependencies and coordination overhead
- Feature expectations from existing customers

New products need:
- Faster iteration loops
- Freedom to make mistakes and pivot
- Customer discovery without legacy baggage
- Speed over stability

Isolation creates the startup conditions inside a larger company.

## How to Apply It

### Setting Up an Isolated Team:

1. **Separate the team physically or virtually**
   - Give them their own space
   - Let them claim and name their area
   - Physical separation reinforces psychological separation

2. **Grant process freedom**
   - Don't require them to follow existing development processes
   - Let them set their own sprint cadence
   - Allow rapid deployment without heavyweight approvals

3. **Assign executive sponsorship**
   - The team should report to someone with real decision authority
   - Decisions shouldn't get reversed or require complex approval chains
   - Reduce bureaucracy like quarterly business updates

4. **Tell other teams not to disturb them**
   - Make it clear from leadership that this team is protected
   - Don't let them get pulled into fires or other priorities
   - This protection must be explicit and enforced

5. **Enable people to shed their old responsibilities**
   - Team members need to transition out of their current work
   - Build knowledge redundancy through pairing before transitions
   - Don't let people be half in/half out

### Requirements for Success:

- **Clear decision-making structure** - Who can approve what?
- **Lightweight communication** - Reduce reporting overhead
- **Senior leadership commitment** - Someone powerful must protect the team
- **Right people** - Those who thrive in ambiguity and can move fast

## Real-World Examples

### Expertcity → GoToMyPC
Expertcity's marketplace wasn't selling. They created an isolated team to work on GoToMyPC:
- Team had process freedom (no waterfall)
- Could deploy more frequently
- Didn't have to create pixel-perfect mockups
- The pivot saved the company

### AppFolio → SecureDocs
A team was isolated to create a new product:
- Separate location within the office
- Daily sprint style vs. team's two-week sprints
- Eventually became its own company
- Successfully acquired in 2022

### McDonald's → Chicken McNugget
When the Chicken McNugget was failing in test markets:
- Small SWAT team brought in
- Worked in a different plant (not their usual facility)
- Reported directly to an executive
- Saved the product

## When to Use It

- **New product development** - Creating something that doesn't fit existing product lines
- **Emergency responses** - Performance crises, security incidents, critical bugs
- **Strategic pivots** - When the company needs to move in a new direction quickly
- **Acquisitions** - Integrating acquired teams that need to stay nimble
- **Experimental initiatives** - Testing new markets or technologies

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **No executive sponsor** - Without top-level protection, the team will get pulled into other work
- **Half-measures** - People split between isolated work and regular responsibilities
- **No handoff plan** - Building something in isolation that others must maintain without involvement
- **Isolation theater** - Calling a team "isolated" without actually changing their constraints
- **Abandonment** - Setting up the team but then ignoring them
