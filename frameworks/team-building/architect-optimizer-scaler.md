# Architect Optimizer Scaler

> "They're all going to be called VP of Sales or Chief Revenue Officer. They're completely different archetypes." - Jonathan Lowenhar

## What It Is

When startups hire executives, they often make the mistake of treating all "VP of Sales" or "VP of Engineering" roles as interchangeable. Jonathan Lowenhar's Architect-Optimizer-Scaler framework reveals that executives in the same functional role actually fall into three completely different archetypes based on what stage of work they excel at.

The insight is that an executive who has only been an Optimizer will fail as an Architect because they've never written a playbook from scratch. Similarly, a great Architect might struggle as a Scaler because they've never had to find 10x leverage. Same title, completely different skill sets.

This framework applies across all executive functions—sales, engineering, product, marketing—and is essential for avoiding expensive mis-hires.

## How It Works

**The Three Archetypes:**

**1. The Architect**
- Builds playbooks from scratch
- Stays close to the founder to extract the "magic" of how they close deals, build products, etc.
- Codifies tribal knowledge into repeatable processes
- Creates structure so the first hires in a function can succeed
- Output: The first playbook that enables scaling

**Example (Sales):**
- Watches founder recordings, listens to calls
- Documents the dance the founder goes through to close deals
- Creates the first sales methodology and scripts
- Hires and trains the first 1-3 account executives

**2. The Optimizer**
- Takes an existing playbook and makes it more efficient
- Grows from a small team to a medium team (e.g., 3 AEs to 10-15)
- Focused on hitting targets and improving metrics
- Refines and iterates on what the Architect built
- Output: Higher-performing version of the original system

**Example (Sales):**
- Increases close rates within existing playbook
- Improves demo effectiveness
- Reduces sales cycle length
- Enhances training and onboarding
- Builds out first-line management

**3. The Scaler**
- Finds leverage—how to get 10x output without 10x effort
- Grows to large teams or alternative channels
- Thinks about "how do I get other people to sell for me?"
- Builds systems, automation, partnerships
- Output: Multiplicative growth beyond linear headcount

**Example (Sales):**
- Builds partner/channel programs
- Creates enterprise vs. SMB motion
- Implements PLG or self-serve alongside sales
- Builds sales enablement at scale
- Manages managers, not individual contributors

## How to Apply It

1. **Diagnose your stage** - Where is your company/function right now?
   - No playbook exists → Need an Architect
   - Playbook exists but team is small → Need an Optimizer
   - Team is medium-sized and needs leverage → Need a Scaler

2. **Interview for stage experience** - Ask candidates directly:
   - "Have you written a playbook from scratch, or have you always optimized existing ones?"
   - "What was the team size when you joined vs. when you left?"
   - "Tell me about a time you had to create a process that didn't exist."

3. **Don't hire ahead** - An Optimizer hired before you have a playbook will struggle. A Scaler hired to lead 3 people will be bored and ineffective.

4. **Plan for transitions** - Accept that you may need different executives at different stages. The Architect you hired at Series A may not be the right Scaler for Series C.

5. **Connect to "done it before"** - When hiring, look for evidence they've succeeded at this specific archetype before. "Have they been an Architect before?" not "Have they been a VP before?"

## When to Use It

- When hiring any executive (VP, CXO level)
- When promoting internal candidates to larger roles
- When diagnosing why a recent executive hire isn't working
- During company stage transitions (Seed→A, A→B, B→C)
- When wondering why your great early hire isn't scaling
- During board conversations about executive team composition
