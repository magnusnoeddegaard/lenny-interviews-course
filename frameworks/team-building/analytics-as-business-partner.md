# Analytics as Business Partner (Central Model)

> "For me, analytics is a business impact driving function and not purely a service function. Not just answering the why, but answering the 'What do we do now that we know this?'" - Jessica Lachs

## What It Is

A centralized analytics organization structure where data scientists and analysts report through a single analytics leader while being embedded in cross-functional pods that map to product, engineering, and operations teams. The key distinction is that analytics has a "seat at the table" as a business partner and thought leader, not just a service function answering questions through tickets.

This model contrasts with embedded analytics where data people report into business units (e.g., marketing analytics reporting to the CMO). While business leaders prefer embedded models for control over roadmaps and guaranteed resources, the central model provides superior outcomes across multiple dimensions.

## How It Works

**Core Principles:**

1. **Seat at the Table**: Analytics is an equal business partner alongside product, engineering, and operations - contributing insights, identifying opportunities, and shaping strategy

2. **Central Reporting, Pod Embedding**: All analytics report up through one org, but are organized into pods that mirror how other functions are structured

3. **Shared Goals**: Analytics teams share the same goals as their business partners, aligning incentives and ensuring everyone succeeds together

**Benefits of the Central Model:**

- **Consistent Talent Bar**: Same hiring rubric and technical standards across the entire org
- **Growth Opportunities**: Lateral moves across domains without leaving the team; room for promotion and people management
- **Methodology Consistency**: Single definitions for metrics; shared models rather than rebuilding the same thing six times
- **Scaling Insights**: See common problems across teams; anticipate issues before they grow
- **Team Culture & Brand**: Shared learning culture, peer review, camaraderie with "like-minded data nerds"

## How to Apply It

1. **Structure your team**: Create a centralized analytics org with pods that map to your company's functional areas (marketing analytics, product analytics, etc.)

2. **Align on goals**: Ensure analytics teams share the exact same goals as their business partner teams - your success should be their success and vice versa

3. **Establish a seat at the table**: Position analytics to bring opportunities and points of view, not just answer questions. Expect proactive insights, not reactive reports

4. **Create mechanisms for prioritization**: Hold weekly standups with partners to align on priorities and openly discuss trade-offs when new requests come in

5. **Solve for embedded benefits**: Address the legitimate concerns of embedded models (team bonding, roadmap control) through pod structures and shared goaling

## When to Use It

- When building or restructuring a data/analytics organization
- When your data team is operating as a "ticket-taking" service function
- When you have data people siloed in different business units with inconsistent practices
- When scaling your analytics team beyond a handful of people
- When you want to improve retention and growth opportunities for data talent
