# R&D Team Integration Model

> "The rest of the company needs to see what you're doing as being core and critical to the mission. It can't seem like these guys are just playing off in a corner on something that isn't related to what we are doing every day." - Adriel Frederick

## What It Is

A framework for establishing innovation, R&D, or "X" teams within larger organizations without triggering "organ rejection"—the organizational immune response that causes innovation teams to fail not because of bad ideas, but because they become culturally isolated from the rest of the company.

Innovation teams often fail because they're perceived as playing in a corner with resources that other teams can't access. This creates resentment and organizational friction that undermines even good ideas.

## How It Works

The framework has three core principles:

### 1. Core and Critical to Mission
The work must be visibly connected to what the company is trying to achieve. Other teams should see the R&D work as advancing shared goals, not tangential exploration.

**Why it matters**: Teams fight for resources. If innovation work seems disconnected, it becomes a target for budget cuts and political attacks. The perception is: "they're not helping us do what we're here to do."

### 2. Everyone's Success
When the innovation team wins, everyone should feel like they win. Success can't be isolated to the R&D team alone.

**Why it matters**: Shared success creates organizational buy-in. When other teams benefit from innovation wins, they become advocates instead of critics.

### 3. Distributed Innovation
Make it clear that innovation doesn't only happen on the R&D team. Other teams still innovate—the R&D team is just taking on specific work that others don't have capacity for.

**Why it matters**: Prevents the perception that "we're stuck with operational stuff while they have all the fun." This reframes the R&D team as complementary, not elite.

## How to Apply It

1. **Connect to company strategy** - When pitching or positioning innovation work, explicitly map it to company-wide goals and initiatives. Show how success benefits the whole organization.

2. **Design for handoffs** - Build innovation projects with the assumption they'll be transferred to or integrated with existing teams. Include those teams early in the process.

3. **Share credit broadly** - When announcing wins, highlight contributions from across the organization. Make success stories about "we" not "the innovation team."

4. **Maintain transparency** - Regular updates to the broader organization about what you're working on and why. Avoid creating information asymmetry that breeds suspicion.

5. **Enable others' innovation** - Share learnings, tools, and approaches that help other teams innovate within their domains. Position yourselves as enablers, not gatekeepers of new ideas.

## When to Use It

- Setting up a new innovation or R&D team
- Repositioning an existing team that's facing organizational resistance
- Planning how to integrate acquired startups or new product lines
- Designing reporting structures for experimental teams
