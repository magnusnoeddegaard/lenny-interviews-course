# Marketing-Sales-Product Hiring

> "I like to think of it in very similar motions to a business where I think there is a marketing aspect to it, there is a sales aspect, and there is a product aspect to it." - Jason Shah

## What It Is

Most people think of hiring as a single process: post a job, review resumes, interview candidates. Jason Shah, drawing from experience at companies ranging from zero-person startups to Amazon and Airbnb, reframes hiring as having three distinct business functions that require different skills and attention.

The insight is that calling it "hiring" or "recruiting" shapes how people think about it. If you instead think of it as "the people you are going to work with every day" or "the people who make the company what it is," you'd naturally invest more attention and sophistication.

## How It Works

### The Marketing Layer

**Question: Has a person even heard of your company? Would they be willing to interview?**

This is about building awareness and reputation before you ever need to fill a role:
- Do potential candidates know your company exists?
- Do they know anyone who works there?
- Do they see your LinkedIn posts or content about what you're building?
- Are you a "known quantity" before they step in the door?

This isn't hard-sell marketing—anything inauthentic will fail. It's about developing a positive brand and reputation both for the company and for yourself as a leader.

### The Sales Layer

**Question: Do you understand what this specific candidate cares about?**

Once a candidate is engaged, you need to understand their specific motivations:
- An engineer might want to work in a world-class engineering organization
- A product person might be excited about crypto and want to learn
- Someone else might care most about mission or team culture

This isn't about misrepresenting or matching whatever they say. It's about understanding who they are so you can evaluate fit both ways—you want them to be happy and effective after joining.

The same mistake Jason made in startup sales applies here: focusing on features ("we have a great tech stack, good benefits, interesting problems") without understanding the one or two things that actually matter to this specific person.

### The Product Layer

**Question: Is the role itself well-designed? Are you iterating on it?**

Job descriptions are almost like product specs: responsibilities, qualifications, requirements. But unlike products, companies often write a job description once and never iterate:

- Post it
- Don't think about it again until it's filled
- Take it down

Product thinking means:
- Meeting people even when you don't know exactly what role they'll fill
- Being flexible about seniority or exact scope
- Iterating the role based on the candidates you meet and the evolving needs of the business
- Treating the role as something you can mold, like Airbnb iterating on Airbnb Plus by building actual rooms, changing pillows and scents, and coaching hosts

## How to Apply It

**Marketing:**
1. Invest in your personal and company reputation before you need to hire
2. Share content about what you're building and learning
3. Stay connected with talented people even when you're not actively recruiting

**Sales:**
1. In early conversations, listen for what candidates actually care about
2. Understand their one or two key motivations
3. Evaluate fit based on whether you can genuinely deliver on what matters to them
4. Be as concerned about post-hiring success as pre-hiring closure

**Product:**
1. Don't treat job descriptions as fixed documents
2. Meet people who are interesting even if you don't have a perfect role
3. Iterate role definitions based on the talent you encounter and business needs
4. Think about crafting a role that makes the person successful, not just filling a headcount

## When to Use It

- When your company is struggling to attract candidates (marketing problem)
- When candidates seem interested but don't accept offers (sales problem)
- When you're meeting great people but don't have the "right" role (product problem)
- When new hires aren't succeeding or staying (could be any of the three)
- When reframing how much time and energy to invest in hiring

## Context Matters

Jason notes the full spectrum he's experienced:
- **Zero-person startup**: Trying to convince a Google engineer to join, incredibly hard with low hit rate
- **Amazon/Airbnb**: Large recruiting organization doing sourcing, formal interview panels and calibrations
- **Alchemy (growth stage)**: Scrappy, founders still meet every candidate, figuring out who to even hire

The framework applies across all stages, but the emphasis shifts. Early stage is more marketing (who even knows you exist?). Larger companies need more product thinking (iterating roles across a complex organization).
