# Small, Senior, Trusted Team

> "There was something around a small, tightly-knit senior team super focused on a problem. And the smallness means just like, less prior miscommunication, and then the tightly-knit means a lot more trust." - Ayo Omojola

## What It Is

This framework captures the conditions for successful "startup within a startup" initiatives. Based on Cash App's growth from ~12 people and 50K actives to 50M+ monthly actives, it identifies the organizational factors that enabled breakthrough success inside a larger company.

Most internal ventures fail because they lack the existential pressure of a true startup—you don't worry about making payroll. This framework describes how to counteract that disadvantage through team composition and structure.

## How It Works

**The Internal Venture Problem:**
When you're a startup inside a company, you lack existential fear. You don't worry about paying your people. This makes it easy to:
- Request more resources than you've earned
- Grow headcount faster than success
- Avoid the hard trade-offs real startups face

**The Cash App Solution:**
Three characteristics defined the team:

1. **Small** - 11-12 people initially, staying small for the first year. Small means less miscommunication, faster decisions, and forced prioritization.

2. **Senior** - The people were tenured at Square and in their careers. They'd done meaningful things before. This created credibility and capability.

3. **Tightly-Knit** - High trust between team members. Trust enables speed and reduces coordination overhead.

**Additional Factors:**
- **Focus** - Clear hero customer (consumer, not merchant). 100% of trade-offs favored the consumer.
- **Firewalling** - Protected from the rest of the organization by strong leadership.
- **Discipline** - Had to "fight for every headcount" (Sarah Fryer enforced this).

## How to Apply It

1. **Keep teams small** - Resist the urge to staff up. Cash App had real scale and a real business before they had real headcount.

2. **Hire senior people** - Especially for founding team. Junior people can come later once the playbook is established.

3. **Build trust first** - Tightly-knit beats talented but disconnected. Previous working relationships help.

4. **Force discipline externally** - Someone outside the team should enforce headcount constraints. Internal ventures tend to over-resource without external pressure.

5. **Firewall from the mothership** - Protect the team from organizational gravity that pulls toward the core business.

6. **Define one hero customer** - Make trade-offs obvious by having a clear primary customer. Cash App never compromised consumer experience for merchant needs.

7. **Require milestone justification** - Don't let the team grow headcount without demonstrating value first.

## When to Use It

- **Internal ventures**: Starting something new inside an existing company
- **Zero-to-one products**: Building something that doesn't yet exist
- **Turnarounds**: Restructuring failing initiatives
- **Highly regulated spaces**: Where deep expertise matters more than headcount
- **Consumer products**: Where focus and speed beat resources
