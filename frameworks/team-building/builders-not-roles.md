# Builders Not Roles

> "We need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles and call ourselves builders. I think that's sort of the most general purpose way of thinking about what we can all be. We can all be builders and I'd love for us to get to the world where that's the title." - Julie Zhuo

## What It Is

A team philosophy that replaces traditional role distinctions (engineer, PM, designer, data scientist) with a single identity: builder. In the AI era, individuals can now perform many tasks that previously required specialists, making rigid role boundaries counterproductive.

The key insight: when you have distinct roles, people delegate work to those roles instead of learning to do it themselves. "I need to figure out product requirements" becomes "that's the PM's job, I'll wait for them." This creates dependencies, bottlenecks, and missed learning opportunities.

With AI tools, a single person can now:
- Write code (even if not an engineer by training)
- Create designs and prototypes
- Analyze data
- Write product requirements
- Handle customer research

The limiting factor is no longer specialized skills but rather initiative and willingness to learn.

## How It Works

**Traditional role model:**
- Clear job descriptions: PM does X, engineer does Y, designer does Z
- When you hit a boundary, you pass work to the specialist
- Teams are assembled by filling all the role slots
- Efficient for specialists, creates handoff friction

**Builder model:**
- Everyone is responsible for shipping outcomes
- Skills matter more than titles
- You use AI to extend your capabilities into unfamiliar areas
- Teams are smaller, more nimble, more empowered
- Specialists exist but consult rather than own

**The critical shift:**
- From "that's not my job" to "how do I solve this?"
- From delegating to learning
- From role coverage to skill coverage
- From process to outcome orientation

## How to Apply It

1. **Eliminate automatic role slots** - Don't default to "we need one PM, one designer, three engineers." Instead ask: "What skills does this project need? Who has them or can learn them?"

2. **Use AI to extend capabilities** - Encourage everyone to use AI tools to do things outside their core expertise. Front-end work, data analysis, writing - AI can bridge gaps.

3. **Remove role-based delegation** - When someone says "the PM should figure that out," push back. The person closest to the problem should figure it out, using whatever help they need.

4. **Invest in cross-training** - Initially, having non-specialists do specialist work is slower. Accept this investment - the long-term payoff is significant.

5. **Maintain skill depth where needed** - Still bring in specialists for complex, high-stakes work. But use them as consultants and reviewers, not as the only people who touch that domain.

## When to Use It

- When building small, nimble teams
- When AI tools are changing what's possible
- When teams feel bottlenecked by role dependencies
- When individuals want to expand their capabilities
- When traditional team structures feel slow
