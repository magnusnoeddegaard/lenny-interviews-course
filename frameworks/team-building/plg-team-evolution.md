# PLG Team Evolution

> "The common place to start is to hire a head of growth, or it can be a lead growth PM, but someone who has a little bit of experience in this area. And then they begin to build this core growth squad as the first growth team... Eventually you need to get to the place basically there is a head of growth product, that's the center of the PLG org. But there's also need to be a head of growth marketing, that's his or her counterpart in marketing organization. And then a head of product led sales, that's the counterpart in the sales organization." - Hila Qu

## What It Is

PLG Team Evolution describes the typical progression of how product-led growth teams form and mature within organizations. It provides a roadmap from initial exploration (tiger teams) through dedicated growth squads to a full cross-functional PLG organization.

Understanding this evolution helps leaders invest appropriately at each stage and plan for future organizational needs as their PLG motion matures.

## How It Works

### Stage 1: Exploration (Tiger Team)

**When to use**: Still building conviction, testing PLG fit

**Structure**:
- Cross-functional team with temporary assignments
- Members from product, data, sales, marketing
- One person driving coordination

**Focus**:
- Validate PLG feasibility
- Run initial experiments
- Build data foundation

**Best for**: PQL/sales conversion projects that require heavy cross-functional work

### Stage 2: Core Growth Squad

**When to use**: Committed to PLG, ready to invest

**Structure**:
- **Growth PM** (Lead) - Strong in analytics, experimentation, funnel thinking
- **Data Analyst** - First critical hire, enables data-driven decisions
- **Dedicated Engineer(s)** - Build experiments and features
- **Designer** - Can be shared initially
- **User Research** - Can be shared initially

**Focus**:
- Activation optimization
- Conversion improvement
- Building the PLG infrastructure

**Key principle**: Growth PM is different from traditional PM - focused on conversion metrics and user journey, not features.

### Stage 3: Full PLG Organization

**When to use**: PLG is working, ready to scale

**Structure**:
Three counterparts working as a unified PLG org:

1. **Head of Growth Product** (Product org)
   - KPIs: Activation rate, usage metrics, PQLs generated
   - Owns the product experience that drives PLG

2. **Head of Growth Marketing** (Marketing org)
   - KPIs: High-quality signups, top of funnel efficiency
   - Owns demand gen for PLG funnel

3. **Head of Product-Led Sales** (Sales org)
   - KPIs: PQL conversion rate, revenue from PLG motion
   - Owns closing PQLs and enterprise accounts

**Key principle**: These three roles work closely despite different reporting lines because they share the PLG funnel.

## How to Apply It

### Starting Your First Team

1. **Hire internally if possible** - Look for:
   - PMs who want to move into growth
   - Analysts who want to become more product-focused
   - Analytical people with cross-functional influence

2. **Match hire to focus area** - If activation is priority, hire someone with activation experience

3. **Prioritize data analyst** - Even before growth PM in some cases; "without insight, your effort is directionless"

4. **Get early wins** - Give the team support, resources, and time to prove the model

### Evolving to PLG Org

1. **Establish counterparts** - As the team grows, ensure marketing and sales have dedicated PLG-focused leaders

2. **Define PLG metrics** - Different from SLG metrics:
   - Signups (not just leads)
   - Activation rate
   - PQLs generated
   - Self-serve conversion
   - PLG-attributed revenue

3. **Create collaboration mechanisms** - The three leaders need strong coordination despite different reporting lines

## When to Use It

- When planning PLG investment and hiring
- When deciding between tiger team vs. dedicated team
- When growth team isn't getting results (might be a resourcing problem)
- When scaling a successful PLG motion
- When reorganizing around growth functions
