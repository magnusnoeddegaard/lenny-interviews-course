# Roadmap as Story

> "My biggest thing that I tell my teams is 'You're telling a story. So what I want from you is I want themes, I want a story. Why are these things the biggest things to invest in, these levers the biggest ones to pull?'" - Jiaona Zhang

## What It Is

Roadmap as Story is a framework that reframes roadmapping from a spreadsheet exercise into a narrative exercise. Rather than presenting a list of projects with RICE scores, you articulate the themes and story behind why you're investing in certain areas.

The framework addresses a common failure mode: teams create elaborate spreadsheets with impact, cost, and effort columns for every project, then present this as their roadmap. But humans don't resonate with spreadsheets—they crave understanding *why* they're doing a body of work. A prioritization framework can help you decide, but a story helps your team execute with conviction.

JZ developed this approach through her experience at Airbnb, WeWork, and Webflow, where she found that theme-based roadmapping led to better execution and adaptability than project-list roadmapping.

## How It Works

**The Traditional (Problematic) Approach:**
- Create a spreadsheet of all possible projects
- Score each on impact, cost, effort (RICE, ICE, etc.)
- Sort and present as "the roadmap"
- Team executes without understanding the "why"

**The Story-Driven Approach:**
- Articulate the narrative: What are we trying to achieve for users and the business?
- Define 3-5 themes that represent your biggest investment areas
- Within each theme, identify the projects that advance that story
- Link out to execution tools (Jira, Linear) rather than maintaining a separate spreadsheet

**Why This Works:**

1. **Adaptability**: When you learn something new, you can evaluate whether it changes your themes and narrative, rather than tweaking individual scores in a spreadsheet

2. **Empowerment**: Teams can come up with the "how" and specific projects because they understand the strategic "why"

3. **Durability**: Themes change less frequently than project priorities, so your roadmap stays relevant longer

4. **Communication**: Stakeholders can understand and remember themes; they can't remember a 50-row spreadsheet

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with the why** - Before listing any projects, write down: What are we trying to achieve for our users? What business outcomes matter? What have we learned about our market?

2. **Identify 3-5 themes** - These are the big investment areas. Examples: "Make onboarding faster," "Enable power users," "Improve trust signals." Each theme should be a clear lever.

3. **Write the narrative** - Create a document (not a deck) that explains each theme: why it matters, what success looks like, and how it connects to the larger company strategy.

4. **Let themes guide projects** - Within each theme, identify specific projects. But present these as examples of work that advances the theme, not as the definitive list.

5. **Link to execution tools** - Don't maintain a separate spreadsheet. Link to Jira/Linear where teams actually track work. This prevents staleness and duplicate effort.

6. **Update themes when you learn** - When user research or data reveals something new, ask: "Does this change my themes?" Not: "What score does this change in my spreadsheet?"

## When to Use It

- **Quarterly and annual planning** - Frame your roadmap as a story, not a list
- **New team onboarding** - Help new members understand the "why" behind current work
- **Stakeholder communication** - Present themes to leadership, not spreadsheets
- **Cross-functional alignment** - Engineering, design, and product all understand the themes
- **Mid-quarter reprioritization** - Evaluate changes against themes, not just project scores

## The Document Format

JZ recommends a document over a deck (decks typically require voiceover, which doesn't work in async/remote cultures):

```
# [Quarter] Roadmap

## What we're trying to achieve
[2-3 paragraphs on user and business outcomes]

## Theme 1: [Theme Name]
Why this matters: [Explanation]
What success looks like: [Outcomes]
Key projects: [Link to Jira/Linear epic]

## Theme 2: [Theme Name]
...

## Theme 3: [Theme Name]
...

## What we're explicitly NOT doing
[List of things that could be themes but aren't]
```
