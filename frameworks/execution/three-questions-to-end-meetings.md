# Three Questions to End a Meeting

> "If you really go around the room at the end of a meeting—six people in the meeting, let's say—and you say to everybody, 'What did we decide here?' And they all write it down, you will get six different answers, even though we're in the same meeting." - Alisa Cohn

## What It Is

A simple ritual of three questions to ask at the end of every meeting that dramatically improves follow-through and alignment. The framework addresses one of the biggest meeting dysfunctions: people leave with different understandings of what happened and what comes next.

The insight is that meetings often fail not during the discussion, but after it ends—when people walk away with different interpretations of what was decided, who owns what, and who needs to be informed.

## How It Works

At the end of every meeting, ask these three questions:

### 1. What did we decide here?

Go around the room and ask each person to state what they think was decided. This surfaces misalignment immediately.

**Why it matters:** People in the same meeting often have completely different interpretations of what was concluded. Without this explicit check, you'll discover the misalignment days or weeks later when it's much harder to fix.

### 2. Who needs to do what by when?

Convert decisions into specific action items with clear owners and deadlines.

**Why it matters:** Decisions without accountability don't lead to action. This question forces specificity and creates the accountability structure for follow-through.

### 3. Who else needs to know?

Identify stakeholders who weren't in the meeting but need to be informed of decisions or commitments made.

**Why it matters:** Executive teams often make decisions and then forget to tell anyone. Commitments get made on behalf of teams who don't know about them. Policies get decided but never communicated. This question prevents the information vacuum that creates confusion and duplicated work.

## How to Apply It

1. **Reserve the last 5-10 minutes** of every meeting for these questions. Build it into your calendar invite or agenda template.

2. **Assign a "meeting czar"** who's responsible for facilitating the closing questions and capturing the answers. Pick someone who enjoys structure and follow-up.

3. **Go around the room** for the first question, especially in smaller meetings. Don't just ask one person—surface the differences.

4. **Put it on screen** if you're short on time. Have someone capture the three answers in a shared doc and confirm alignment visually.

5. **Follow up in writing** after the meeting with the captured decisions, actions, and communication plan.

### Sample Closing Facilitation

> "Before we end, let's make sure we're aligned. What did we decide here today?"
>
> [Go around or ask for volunteers]
>
> "Great. Now, who needs to do what by when?"
>
> [Capture specific owners and dates]
>
> "Finally, who else needs to know about these decisions? Who do we need to loop in?"
>
> [Identify stakeholders and assign communication owners]

## When to Use It

- **Every recurring team meeting** - Make it a ritual
- **Executive/leadership meetings** - Where cascading decisions is critical
- **Cross-functional meetings** - Where alignment across teams matters
- **Strategy discussions** - Where ambiguity is most dangerous
- **Any meeting where decisions are made** - Don't let them evaporate

## The Power Move

You don't have to be the meeting leader to use this framework. Anyone can raise their hand in the last few minutes and say:

> "Before we wrap up, can we quickly go around the room? What did we decide here?"

Doing this consistently makes you valuable to every meeting you're in. People will notice that meetings run better when you're there, and that follow-through improves. This is how you develop a reputation as someone who gets things done.
