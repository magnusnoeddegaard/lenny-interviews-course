# Vision-Execution Balance

> "It's back to I don't want to deliberate and pontificate for weeks on end about which door I should run through. And I don't want to go to the other extreme and just spend 30 seconds thinking about what to do and just go, go, go. So it's finding that kind of happy medium." - JM Nickels

## What It Is

Vision-Execution Balance is the recognition that strategy and execution exist on a spectrum, and effective teams need to consciously shift between modes based on their situation. It's not about finding one "right" ratio—it's about dynamic adjustment.

JM Nickels observed both failure modes at different companies:
- At early Uber, the marketplace team sometimes got lost in "theory land" with beautiful whiteboard diagrams that were impossible to implement
- At DoorDash, the "ready, fire, aim" culture sometimes ran through walls without checking if they were the right walls

The solution isn't to eliminate either mode, but to recognize when to shift emphasis.

## How It Works

**Two Failure Modes:**

*Theory Land (Too Much Vision):*
- Weeks of deliberation without action
- Beautiful frameworks that can't be built
- PhDs debating while nothing ships
- "Boiling the ocean" designs

*Action Land (Too Much Execution):*
- 30 seconds of thinking then go, go, go
- Running through walls without knowing which wall
- Effort wasted on wrong problems
- Learning by expensive failure

**The Dynamic Balance:**
- Strategy should be "baked" for a period, then execute
- Pull back when strategy is unclear or pivoting
- Push forward when direction is set
- Adjust based on organizational stage and context

**The 70/30 Heuristic:**
- When strategy is clear: ~70% execution, ~30% refinement
- When pivoting or lost: ~70% strategy, ~30% testing
- These numbers are illustrative, not prescriptive

## How to Apply It

1. **Assess your current mode** - Are you in a strategy phase or an execution phase? Make it explicit.

2. **Watch for mode mismatch** - If you're executing hard but direction is unclear, stop and strategize. If you're strategizing but direction is clear, start executing.

3. **Set clear transitions** - "For the next 6 months, strategy is baked. Pedal to the metal on execution." Make the shift explicit.

4. **Protect strategy time** - It's easy for execution to crowd out everything. Deliberately block time for strategic thinking.

5. **Read the signals** - Soul-searching about pivots? Pull back and think. Clear strategy with momentum? Push forward and ship.

## When to Use It

- During quarterly/annual planning
- When feeling stuck (diagnose: is it strategy or execution?)
- When onboarding to a new team (understand their bias)
- When projects fail (was it wrong strategy or poor execution?)
- When deciding how to spend leadership time
- When coaching teams that seem imbalanced
