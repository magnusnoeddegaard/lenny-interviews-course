# Separate Everything (New Co Inside Existing Co)

> "Separate engineering team, separate design team, separate accounts and operations team, separate finance team. Early on, everything was separate. People only had one job and one job only, and that was making Handshake AI successful." - Garrett Lord

## What It Is

When incubating a new venture inside an established company, the most critical success factor is complete separation from the parent organization. This means separate people, separate space, separate processes, and separate expectations—essentially running a startup that happens to share ownership with a larger company.

The alternative—trying to leverage existing resources, borrow people part-time, or integrate with existing processes—typically fails because the gravitational pull of the established business overwhelms the nascent venture.

## How It Works

**Complete Team Separation**: Every person on the new venture has one job and one job only. No split responsibilities with the parent company. People are recruited to join the new venture full-time, even when taken from high-performing roles in the existing business.

**Physical Separation**: The team sits in a different part of the office. This isn't symbolic—it prevents the constant interruptions, context-switching, and gradual absorption that kill new ventures.

**Different Expectations**: The new venture explicitly operates with startup expectations: 24/7 commitment, weekend work, 2 AM pushes. These expectations are communicated clearly during hiring. People who don't want that intensity can stay in the parent company.

**Different Compensation**: Compensation is tied to the new venture's outcomes, creating ownership mentality. People feel like founders building something, not employees executing a project.

**Founder Leadership**: The CEO or another senior founder directly runs the new venture, spending 80%+ of their time on it. This isn't delegated to a GM or product leader—it requires founder-level commitment and authority.

## How to Apply It

1. **Dedicate your best people full-time** - Take top performers from the existing business and ask them to join permanently. Accept that the parent company will feel the loss.

2. **Create physical and organizational boundaries** - Separate space, separate all-hands, separate onboarding, separate recruiting. Make it feel like a different company.

3. **Set explicit expectations** - Be upfront that this is startup-level intensity. Not everyone will want this; that's fine. You need people who do.

4. **Have the founder lead it** - If you're the CEO, this becomes your primary job. Your executive team runs the existing business while you focus on the new one.

5. **Maintain connection points carefully** - Some integration is necessary (shared audience, brand, legal), but these should be explicit and minimal, not organic and creeping.

## When to Use It

- When pursuing a major strategic opportunity that requires startup speed and focus
- When the new venture has fundamentally different market dynamics than the existing business
- When previous attempts to innovate within existing structures have failed
- When the opportunity is time-sensitive and requires leaving everything else behind

## Example

Handshake's AI data business exemplifies this model:

- Started with 4-5 people, grew to 75+ in months
- Everyone came 100% dedicated, including senior engineers "parachuted" from the main business
- CEO spent 80%+ of time on it, flying to meet customers over Christmas and New Year
- Separate office space, separate all-hands, separate onboarding
- Explicit 24/7 expectations communicated during hiring
- Compensation tied to new venture milestones

Result: Zero to $50M ARR in four months, on track to exceed the parent company's revenue within two years.
