# Trading Concessions

> "They might get into something that we've said, we have about six weeks. Well, we're only give it six weeks and two weeks in they go, we actually stumbled into something we didn't realize. This is probably not going to be able to be done the way we thought. So can we do it this way? And then we have a discussion and there's a conversation. There's a lot of molding and changing that happens." - Jason Fried

## What It Is

Trading Concessions is the practice of continuously negotiating scope during development rather than extending deadlines when obstacles arise. When teams encounter unexpected complexity, instead of asking for more time, they propose alternative approaches that achieve the core intent within the original time constraint.

This approach recognizes that perfect information doesn't exist at the start of a project. Teams will discover things they didn't expect. The question is: what happens then? Traditional approaches extend the timeline. Trading Concessions keeps time fixed and adjusts scope.

The method creates a collaborative dialogue between those who shaped the work and those implementing it. Both parties bring valuable perspectives—the shapers understand the intent and priorities, the implementers understand the technical realities. Trading concessions is how these perspectives get aligned when reality diverges from the plan.

## How It Works

**The Traditional Pattern**:
1. Team estimates 4 weeks
2. Team discovers complexity at week 2
3. Team says "we need 6 weeks"
4. Timeline extends
5. Scope often grows to fill the extra time

**The Trading Concessions Pattern**:
1. Team has 6-week appetite
2. Team discovers complexity at week 2
3. Team proposes: "We could do X instead of Y and hit the target"
4. Discussion about what really matters
5. Agree on adjusted scope, time stays fixed

**The Conversation**:
- Team: "The original approach won't fit. Can we do it this way instead?"
- Shaper: "What would we lose?"
- Team: "This edge case and this polish item"
- Shaper: "The edge case matters, the polish doesn't. Keep the edge case, cut the polish."

## How to Apply It

1. **Establish fixed timeframes upfront**: Concessions only work when time is truly fixed. If everyone knows deadlines slide, no one will offer concessions.

2. **Frame scope as negotiable from the start**: Set expectations that the "how" is flexible even when the "what" and "when" are not.

3. **Create safe space for early flags**: Teams should feel comfortable raising concerns at week 2, not week 5. Reward early honesty.

4. **Focus discussions on intent, not spec**: When trading, keep returning to "what are we really trying to achieve?" The answer often reveals what's truly essential.

5. **Document trade-offs explicitly**: When you accept a concession, write it down. "We're shipping X without Y because Z."

6. **Review concessions post-ship**: Sometimes concessions reveal that the original scope was overbuilt. Other times, you need to return and add what was cut.

## When to Use It

- Fixed-deadline projects (which should be all projects)
- When teams hit unexpected complexity
- Sprint or cycle planning discussions
- Any time scope creep threatens timelines
- Building a culture of shipping over perfection
