# Product Ops as System

> "Product operations is the creation of some system that allows you to thrive or allows your team to thrive in product management." - Christine Itwaru

## What It Is

Product ops has two distinct meanings that people often conflate. The first is a thing you do—creating systems, processes, and structures that enable product managers to be more effective. The second is a role—hiring people who serve as strategic advisors to product leadership.

The key insight is that you don't necessarily need product ops people to have product ops. Any VP, head of product, or product manager can build systems that make their team more effective. The emergence of the dedicated role happened as organizations grew complex enough that these systems required full-time attention.

The most successful product ops implementations treat the function as system creation first and staffing second. The goal is to stand up whatever processes or systems are needed, then get out of the way so the team can focus on strategic value.

## How It Works

Product ops addresses several key problem areas:

1. **Voice of Customer Management** - Synthesizing qualitative and quantitative data from multiple sources (sales, success, support, NPS) so PMs don't have to manually filter noise
2. **Cross-functional Transparency** - Creating alignment between revenue teams and product teams so stakeholders understand what's coming and what to do with it
3. **Tooling Optimization** - Setting up the PM tool stack (analytics, CRM integrations, feedback systems) for maximum effectiveness
4. **Content Strategy** - Weaving education into the product experience and development lifecycle
5. **Process Facilitation** - Standardizing planning and development processes (though this is where it overlaps with program management)

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with systems, not hiring** - Before adding headcount, ask: "What system would make our PMs more effective?" Build that system first
2. **Define what you're holding PMs accountable for** - If PMs are accountable for understanding customers and working with engineers, everything else that still needs to happen is a potential product ops system
3. **Measure quality of inbound** - Track whether stakeholder questions shift from "teach me how to do this" to "tell us what you do because our customers would benefit"
4. **Plan for automation** - Build systems with the intention of eventually automating them or handing them off, so you can move to higher-leverage work
5. **Get executive buy-in first** - The most successful implementations have CPO or CEO sponsorship that clarifies the role's value

## When to Use It

Use this framework when:
- Your PMs spend significant time fielding questions from sales/success instead of talking to customers
- There's inconsistency in how different product teams plan, measure outcomes, or communicate with stakeholders
- Launches fail due to lack of readiness across the organization, not product quality
- You're growing rapidly and existing informal processes aren't scaling
- You have transparency problems—teams know something is coming but don't know what to do with it
