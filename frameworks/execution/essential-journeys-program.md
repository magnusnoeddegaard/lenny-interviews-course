# Essential Journeys Program

> "We started with 15 of our most important user journeys... Those 15 things then each have engineering, product and design leaders that are responsible for the quality of those products. They review these journeys, what we call walk the store, where they review them as if they're walking the floor of their store on a regular cadence." - Katie Dill

## What It Is

The Essential Journeys Program is Stripe's operationalized approach to maintaining product quality at scale. It addresses the problem that products can be high-quality when shipped but regress over time as other changes are made and organizational focus shifts.

The program assigns ownership of critical user journeys to cross-functional leadership teams (engineering, product, and design). These owners regularly walk through the journeys as users would—starting from Google search, through the website, documentation, dashboard, and beyond—and score them against a quality rubric.

The key innovation is the calibration process: leaders come together to discuss and debate their scores, building shared understanding of quality standards across the organization.

## How It Works

**1. Define Critical Journeys**
Select 15 (or another manageable number) of your most important user journeys. These should be comprehensive end-to-end flows that matter deeply to users.

**2. Assign Ownership**
Each journey has engineering, product, and design leaders responsible for its quality. They do the walkthroughs together as a multidisciplinary team.

**3. Walk the Store Quarterly**
Owners walk through their journey as a user would:
- Start from Google search or external entry points
- Go through website, docs, dashboard
- Experience the full flow end-to-end
- Document friction and wins in a structured friction log

**4. Score Using a Rubric**
Rate the journey on:
- Utility: Does it achieve the user's goal?
- Usability: Is it easy to use?
- Desirability: Is it pleasant and trustworthy?
- Surprisingly Great: Does it exceed expectations?

Use colors (not numbers) to avoid over-indexing on precision.

**5. Calibrate in Product Quality Reviews (PQR)**
Leaders present their scores and reasoning. Cross-functional executives discuss and debate to build shared understanding of the quality bar.

## How to Apply It

1. **Start small** - Pick your top 5-10 most critical user journeys rather than trying to cover everything.

2. **Make it cross-functional** - The engineer notices load times, the designer notices visual inconsistencies, the PM notices copy confusion. Together they see more.

3. **Use colors, not numbers** - Qualitative scores (red/yellow/green) prevent false precision debates and keep focus on judgment.

4. **Schedule the cadence** - Quarterly is enough time for meaningful changes but frequent enough to catch regressions.

5. **Document in a shared dashboard** - Scores over time show progress and create accountability.

6. **Include leadership** - Having executives in calibration sessions signals importance and ensures buy-in for fixing issues.

## When to Use It

- When product quality is regressing over time
- When multiple teams work on different parts of the same user journey
- When there's no shared language for discussing quality
- When quality improvements aren't being prioritized against feature work
- When you need to scale quality culture beyond the founding team
