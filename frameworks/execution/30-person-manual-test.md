# 30-Person Manual Test

> "Before you buy any tool, don't even think about tools... Can you manually find 30 people that you want to spend 15 to 20 minutes writing a rock solid note to? Are there 30 people that you are deeply excited to learn from, that you are willing to invest 15 to 20 minutes to write a really thoughtful note?" - Jen Abel

## What It Is

The 30-Person Manual Test is a deliberate pre-automation exercise where founders manually research, write, and send highly personalized outreach to exactly 30 prospective customers. The goal is not volume—it's learning.

This approach prevents the common founder mistake of immediately setting up Clay, Apollo, or other automation tools and blasting thousands of prospects before understanding who they're actually trying to reach.

## How It Works

### The Exercise

1. **Find 30 people manually**
   - Use LinkedIn, industry publications, company websites
   - Choose people you're genuinely excited to learn from
   - If finding 30 is hard, that's a signal

2. **Spend 15-20 minutes per outreach**
   - Write each note specifically for that person
   - Use the RCCP framework (Relevancy, Counterintuitive, Concise, Problem-focused)
   - No templates, no automation

3. **Multi-channel approach**
   - Email
   - LinkedIn
   - Cold call (often highest response rate)
   - Twitter DM if relevant

4. **Track and analyze**
   - How many respond?
   - What do they say?
   - What patterns emerge?

### What You Learn

**From finding the 30:**
- Are they even discoverable?
- What commonalities exist (team size, industry, tenure, previous roles)?
- What parameters could you use for future targeting?

**From the responses (or lack thereof):**
- Does your message resonate?
- Is the problem felt?
- Is this the right role/persona?

**From conversations:**
- Is the problem real?
- How do they describe it?
- What would they pay for a solution?

### The Math Problem

If 0 out of 30 respond:
- Is it the message?
- Is it the audience?
- Is it the problem you're solving?

These questions are impossible to answer at scale. You need the manual learning first.

## How to Apply It

1. **Resist the tool temptation**
   - Engineers want to automate everything
   - Sales tools create false confidence
   - Blasting 5,000 emails teaches you nothing

2. **Make it painful on purpose**
   - The 15-20 minutes forces quality
   - You can't fake thoughtfulness at this pace
   - Each rejection or non-response is data

3. **Look for commonalities**
   - Same industry? Same company size?
   - Same stage of company? Same problem urgency?
   - This builds your targeting parameters

4. **Iterate before scaling**
   - Do another 30 with refined message
   - Do another 30 with different persona
   - Only automate when you understand the pattern

5. **Use all channels**
   - Don't rely on just email
   - Cold calling has surprisingly high response rates
   - Multi-touch increases connection probability

## When to Use It

- **Before buying any sales tools**: Clay, Apollo, Outreach, etc.
- **When entering a new market segment**: Test before scaling
- **When response rates drop**: Return to manual to diagnose
- **When pivoting your positioning**: Validate before automating

## The Discoverability Test

One often-overlooked benefit: this exercise tests whether your target market is even findable.

- Can you find 30 people who fit your criteria?
- If not, you have a fundamental go-to-market problem
- Some parameters are "undiscoverable" (net worth, intent signals)
- If you can't find them, you can't scale outreach to them

## Common Mistakes

- **Automating before understanding**: The biggest mistake
- **Doing 5 instead of 30**: Too small a sample
- **Rushing the outreach**: Quality over speed
- **Not multi-channeling**: Email alone isn't enough
- **Not analyzing patterns**: The learning is the point
