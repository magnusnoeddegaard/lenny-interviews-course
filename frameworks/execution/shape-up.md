# Shape Up

> "We don't have a spec, we don't create to-dos or tasks or tickets for people. They create the work that needs to get done to fulfill the idea that we've written up and designed essentially, and they figure out how to do it." - Jason Fried

## What It Is

Shape Up is 37signals' development framework for building products. It replaces traditional agile practices like sprints, backlogs, and detailed specifications with a fundamentally different approach centered on fixed time budgets, small teams, and shaped work.

The methodology gets its name from the "shaping" phase where work is defined at the right level of abstraction—not too vague to be unclear, but not so detailed that it removes creativity from the implementing team. The goal is to give teams clear boundaries and direction while allowing them the autonomy to figure out the best path to completion.

Shape Up emerged from 37signals' belief that constraints create better work. By limiting projects to six weeks maximum and teams to two people, they prevent the sprawl, complexity, and demotivation that comes from large, open-ended projects.

## How It Works

**Six-Week Cycles**: Every project has a maximum duration of six weeks. This isn't an estimate of how long something will take—it's a fixed budget (called an "appetite") that the team must work within.

**Two-Person Teams**: Each project is built by one designer and one programmer. This small team has full autonomy over implementation decisions.

**Shaping Before Building**: Before a project begins, senior people "shape" the work—defining the boundaries, key elements, and potential pitfalls without creating detailed specifications.

**Cool-Down Periods**: After each six-week cycle, teams take a two-week cool-down where they can fix bugs, explore ideas, or tighten up recent work.

**Hill Charts**: Progress is tracked visually using a hill metaphor—work starts on the uphill side (figuring things out) and moves to the downhill side (pure execution).

**Fixed Time, Variable Scope**: Rather than extending deadlines, teams cut scope to ship within the time box. Trade-offs are expected.

## How to Apply It

1. **Set appetites, not estimates**: Ask "How much time are we willing to spend on this?" not "How long will this take?" Cap at six weeks maximum.

2. **Shape work before assigning it**: Define the problem and key elements at the right abstraction level—enough to guide, not enough to constrain.

3. **Keep teams small**: Two people maximum. If something seems to need more, it needs to be re-scoped.

4. **Create space between cycles**: Use cool-down periods for maintenance, exploration, and preparation of the next cycle.

5. **Let projects die if incomplete**: If work isn't done in six weeks and there's still uphill work remaining, seriously consider killing it rather than extending.

6. **Start new every cycle**: Don't carry forward backlog debt. Every six weeks, decide fresh what's worth doing.

## When to Use It

- Product development teams looking for an alternative to traditional agile
- Organizations suffering from endless projects that never ship
- Teams with a culture of trust and autonomy
- Companies wanting to prevent scope creep and deadline extensions
- Situations where two-week sprints feel too short for meaningful work
