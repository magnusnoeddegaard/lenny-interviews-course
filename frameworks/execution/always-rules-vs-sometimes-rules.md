# Always Rules vs Sometimes Rules

> "Always rules are better than sometimes rules for self-control. If you're going to diet, 'I'm going to skip lunch every day.' Like holy, you haven't full thought on that at some point like a day with a big executive review, 'I really need to make sure I'm well-fed before I go into this review.' And now you've broken the streak and now it's over." - Alex Komoroske

## What It Is

Always Rules vs Sometimes Rules is a self-control framework that favors absolute commitments over conditional ones. The insight is that "sometimes" rules constantly require willpower to evaluate and decide, while "always" rules become automatic once established.

The key is designing always-rules that you know you can keep forever—not aspirational rules that sound good but will inevitably break.

## How It Works

**Sometimes Rules (Weak):**
- "I'll try to exercise most days"
- "I'll eat healthier"
- "I'll skip dessert when I can"
- "I'll work out unless I'm too busy"

**Always Rules (Strong):**
- "I will do a Peloton workout every single day" (Alex hasn't missed since the pandemic started)
- "I will not have a dessert unless it would be socially awkward not to"
- "Every Friday, I don't take meetings"

**Why Always Rules Work:**
1. No daily decision required—removes willpower drain
2. Streak psychology kicks in ("Is today the day I break 1,000 days?")
3. No negotiating with yourself about exceptions
4. Clearer boundary makes it easier to explain to others

**Designing Good Always Rules:**
- Make them sustainable forever, not just temporarily
- Build in necessary exceptions explicitly (the dessert rule includes "unless socially awkward")
- Set the bar at something you know you can hit even on hard days
- A meditation instead of a full workout during commute days = still counts

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify the behavior you want**
   - What do you want to do more or less of?
   - What "sometimes" rule have you been failing to keep?

2. **Design a sustainable always rule**
   - What's a version you could keep literally forever?
   - Build in only the exceptions you truly need
   - Make the bar achievable on your worst days

3. **Start the streak**
   - Track it (apps, calendar, notebook)
   - Each day ask: "Is today the worst day ever to do this?"
   - The answer is almost always no

4. **Protect the streak**
   - Never break it for convenience
   - Have a minimum viable version for hard days
   - The longer the streak, the more valuable it becomes

5. **Use social accountability**
   - Tell others about your rule
   - Let the streak become part of your identity
   - "I don't do that" is easier than "I'm trying not to"

## When to Use It

**Best for:**
- Habits you want to build or break
- Self-control challenges you've failed before
- Behaviors where "sometimes" has meant "rarely"
- Areas where decision fatigue undermines your intentions

**Examples:**
- Exercise: "I exercise every day" (with minimum viable workout)
- Diet: "I don't eat X" (with explicit social exceptions)
- Work: "I don't take meetings on Fridays"
- Sleep: "I'm in bed by 10pm"
- Communication: "I respond to emails within 24 hours"

**Note:** The rule should be something you genuinely want to do. Always rules work for alignment, not for forcing yourself into things you don't actually want.
