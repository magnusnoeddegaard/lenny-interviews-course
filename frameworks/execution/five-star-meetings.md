# Five-Star Meetings

> "What's required to make one of your meetings five stars? If you do that, every single problem with your company will come to the surface." - Joe Hudson

## What It Is

Five-Star Meetings is an organizational diagnostic and improvement framework: commit to making every meeting enjoyable, and you'll surface every problem in your company. The unenjoyable meetings reveal exactly where to focus your attention.

Joe Hudson observes that everyone has experienced hard meetings that were still great, and easy meetings that were soul-crushing. The question isn't about difficulty—it's about whether people walk out thinking "That was great!" When a meeting isn't five stars, something needs attention.

The framework works because "the atomic structure of a company is the meetings and the decisions." All a company really is, is people's relationships and ideas. Meetings are where these interact. Fix the meetings, and you fix the company.

## How It Works

**Why meeting quality is diagnostic:**
- Companies are built on relationships and ideas
- Meetings are where relationships and ideas interact
- Every organizational dysfunction shows up in meetings
- An unenjoyable meeting always points to a deeper issue

**The diagnostic power:**
- If you have ten five-star meetings but two that suck, you know exactly where to focus
- The dysfunctional meeting reveals the dysfunctional area of the business
- No hunting for problems—they surface automatically

**Example: Content creator YouTube meetings**
- Stated: "My YouTube meetings suck. They're never going to get better."
- Others responded: "We love our YouTube meetings! How could this not work?"
- Insight: The team, the content—none of it worked for him
- Action: Committed to making YouTube meetings enjoyable
- Result: YouTube numbers went "off the charts" in a short period

**The timeline:**
- Most executives take about two months to achieve all five-star meetings (goal is one month)
- At the end, they typically have half the number of meetings
- Companies become more effective with fewer, better meetings

## How to Apply It

1. **Commit to the standard** - Decide that every meeting should be one people walk out of thinking "That was great!"

2. **Rate your meetings** - Start tracking which meetings feel five-star and which don't

3. **Investigate the low-rated ones** - The unenjoyable meeting points to something needing attention—people, process, purpose, or dynamics

4. **Don't accept "that's just how it is"** - The belief that certain meetings can't be enjoyable is a flag for deeper issues

5. **Fix or eliminate** - Either transform the meeting or question whether it needs to exist

6. **Extend to your teams** - Once your meetings are five-star, help your teams achieve the same standard

## When to Use It

- When assessing organizational health
- When meetings feel like obligations rather than opportunities
- When looking for where to focus improvement efforts
- When a particular function seems underperforming (check its meetings)
- As a leadership practice for continuous improvement
- When onboarding executives to quickly diagnose their organization
