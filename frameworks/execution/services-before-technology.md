# Services Before Technology

> "40 to 50% have to sell some form of service before they can sell a technology... It shows intent. You can call them a customer. You can use their logo. And you are getting paid to educate them. You are getting paid to help them design their process. This is where all the power lives." - Jen Abel

## What It Is

Services Before Technology is a counterintuitive early-stage sales strategy where B2B SaaS startups sell consulting, implementation, or advisory services as a stepping stone to selling their actual software product. Rather than forcing technology adoption on unprepared buyers, you get paid to prepare them—and position yourself as the obvious technology choice.

This approach recognizes that many enterprise buyers cannot adopt new technology because they lack the strategy, process, or organizational readiness. By selling services first, you become the trusted partner who builds that foundation.

## How It Works

### The Buyer Maturity Problem

Before an organization can buy technology, they need:
- An existing process or strategy for the problem area
- An implementation team or plan
- Clear success metrics
- Stakeholder alignment

If these don't exist, **they can't buy your technology yet**—but they can buy your services.

### What You're Actually Selling

**Services you can offer:**
- Strategy design for the problem area
- Process implementation
- Internal pitch development (literally writing the business case)
- Integration planning with existing tools
- Workflow mapping
- Pilot program design
- Training and change management

### The Strategic Value

Selling services first provides:

1. **Logo acquisition** - They're a customer, regardless of how they pay
2. **Revenue signal** - Shows investor intent, even if not recurring
3. **Market education position** - You set the stage for how they think about the problem
4. **Trust building** - You become the insider, not an outside vendor
5. **Competitive moat** - You're embedded before competitors know the deal exists

### Time-Boxing Services

**Always limit services to 90-day increments.** Beyond that:
- Too much will change
- You might not want to continue
- You don't want to lock yourself into unprofitable work

## How to Apply It

1. **Assess buyer maturity on the first call**
   - "Do you have an existing process for solving X?"
   - "Who would implement a solution like this?"
   - "Have you budgeted for this area before?"

2. **If they lack process/strategy, offer services**
   - "We could help you design the process first"
   - "We can help you build the business case for leadership"
   - "We can scope what implementation would look like"

3. **Position services as path to technology**
   - Be transparent: services lead to your technology
   - This is consulting them toward acquisition
   - They know you're biased, and that's fine

4. **Get paid, even nominally**
   - Any payment establishes them as a customer
   - You can use their logo
   - It shows market validation to investors

5. **Use services to set the mindset**
   - You design the evaluation criteria
   - You define what "success" looks like
   - You establish the buying process

## When to Use It

- **Selling to traditional industries** not used to buying from startups
- **Selling novel technology** (like AI) where buyers lack strategy
- **Enterprise deals** where the business unit lacks implementation resources
- **New category creation** where the buying process doesn't exist yet
- **Regulated industries** where procurement needs simplified classification

## Handling Investor Concerns

Investors may push back on service revenue:

**The counterargument:**
"Should I wait 18 months until they're ready to buy software, and let someone else educate them? These are the implications of waiting."

Service revenue shows:
- Market intent
- Customer validation
- Your ability to land enterprise logos
- A path to technology revenue

Many AI startups in 2023-2024 led with services to set the mindset with buyers around what AI implementation looks like.

## The Procurement Advantage

Services contracts are easier to close because:
- Enterprises are used to buying services (it's their largest budget line)
- Legal and procurement understand services
- Technology contracts trigger IT security reviews, insurance requirements
- Services feel lower risk to approve

If you go straight to technology, you may need $5M insurance policies and full security audits. Services bypass much of this friction.
