# Easy to Learn, Hard to Master

> "Easy to learn, hard to master. That's my summary." - Jason Droege

## What It Is

Easy to Learn, Hard to Master captures the fundamental dynamic of AI implementation in enterprises. The same accessibility that makes AI exciting—anyone can spin up a POC in minutes—creates a denominator problem that explains why 95% of AI projects fail to reach production.

The human mind plays a trick: when you get 60-70% of the way there, it feels like the rest is no big deal. But like uptime in data centers, every additional "nine" of reliability requires an order of magnitude more investment. The gap between a working demo and a production system that handles mission-critical workflows is far larger than it appears.

## How It Works

**The POC Trap**
- AI tools are incredibly easy to try
- You can show promising results in hours or days
- This creates massive FOMO and "I need to try this" pressure
- The denominator of attempted projects explodes

**The Mastery Gap**
- Getting from 60-70% accuracy to production-ready requires months, not minutes
- Legal approval, policy approval, regulatory approval, change management
- Accuracy requirements for mission-critical processes are much higher than POC standards
- The last 30-40% of effort often takes 10x the resources of the first 60-70%

**The Uptime Analogy**
- One nine (90% uptime) = a web server in a dorm room
- Five nines (99.999% uptime) = massive investment in redundancy and monitoring
- The numbers seem close but the effort is exponentially different
- Same dynamic applies to AI accuracy in production systems

## How to Apply It

1. **Budget for the full journey** - If a POC takes a week, budget 6-12 months to get to production on mission-critical workflows. These timelines are real.

2. **Identify the "last 30%"** - Before starting, map out what it takes to get from "this demo is cool" to "I would bet my job on this system." The list is longer than you think.

3. **Find a quality partner** - The failure rate drops dramatically when you work with partners who have done this before and know what the full journey requires.

4. **Adjust accuracy expectations** - If your current human process is 10-20% accurate, AI can be transformative at 60-80%. If your human process is 98% accurate, you're not there yet with AI.

5. **Don't mistake activity for progress** - The fact that you've launched 50 POCs doesn't mean you're ahead. The question is how many have reached production.

## The Accuracy Sweet Spot

AI implementations work best when:
- The current human process is relatively inaccurate (10-30%)
- Getting to 60-80% accuracy creates massive value
- The system knows when to escalate to humans for the remaining cases

AI implementations struggle when:
- The current process is already 98% accurate
- The expectation is that AI will close the remaining 2%
- There's no human-in-the-loop for edge cases
