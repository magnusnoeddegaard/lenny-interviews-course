# Lost-Bot Analysis (Deal-Bot)

> "The biggest loss that quarter according to the account executive was lost on price. And when you ran the agent over every Slack interaction, every email, every GONG call, it said actually you lost because you never really got in touch with an economic buyer." - Jeanne DeWitt Grosser

## What It Is

Lost-Bot Analysis is the practice of using AI agents to analyze all communications in a sales process—call transcripts, emails, Slack messages—to identify the real reasons deals were won or lost, rather than relying on salesperson self-reporting.

The insight is that salespeople often misdiagnose why they lost deals (commonly blaming price when the real issue was different). An AI agent that reviews every touchpoint can identify patterns humans miss: failure to reach economic buyers, unconvincing ROI arguments, poor objection handling, or timing issues.

The concept evolved from analyzing lost deals retrospectively ("Lost-Bot") to real-time deal coaching ("Deal-Bot") that provides guidance during active sales cycles.

## How It Works

**Lost-Bot (Retrospective Analysis)**:
1. Take your list of lost opportunities, sorted by deal size
2. Feed the agent every communication: GONG calls, emails, Slack threads
3. Agent analyzes for patterns in what went wrong
4. Compare agent conclusions to AE-reported loss reasons
5. Categorize true loss reasons and surface actionable insights

**Deal-Bot (Real-Time Coaching)**:
1. Agent monitors active deals continuously
2. Feeds insights into Slack channels for each opportunity
3. Provides coaching like: "You're 60% through the sales process and haven't talked to an economic buyer"
4. Suggests follow-up strategies based on conversation analysis
5. Flags when deals are showing warning signs of losses past

## How to Apply It

1. **Choose Your Platform**: You need recorded calls (Gong, Chorus, etc.) and written communications (email, Slack) as input.

2. **Start with Lost Deals**: Build a Lost-Bot first—it's lower stakes and gives you training data for what patterns predict losses.

3. **Define Loss Categories**: Create a taxonomy of real loss reasons (no economic buyer access, poor value demonstration, timing, competition, price, etc.)

4. **Compare to Self-Reporting**: Track how often agent conclusions differ from salesperson explanations. Large discrepancies indicate coaching opportunities.

5. **Feed Back to Training**: Use insights to improve:
   - Sales playbooks and objection handling
   - Discovery question frameworks
   - Demo content and value propositions
   - Enablement programs

6. **Evolve to Real-Time**: Once you trust Lost-Bot accuracy, build Deal-Bot to intervene during active sales cycles.

## When to Use It

- When you have enough lost deals to analyze (10+ per quarter)
- When you suspect salespeople are misattributing why they lose
- When you're trying to improve sales training and enablement
- When you have recorded calls and documented communications
- When you want to surface patterns across many deals that humans can't see
