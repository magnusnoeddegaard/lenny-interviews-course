# Cockroach Startup Principle

> "The market had just crashed basically with all the banks going out of business and everything. And so we were only funding startups that we felt had really scrappy founders and could be cockroaches, meaning could live off of very little amounts of money, or could charge customers and make money." - Jessica Livingston

## What It Is

The Cockroach Startup Principle is an investment and operational philosophy that emerged from Y Combinator's experience during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. It prioritizes funding founders who demonstrate the ability to survive on minimal resources - like cockroaches that can survive almost anything.

During market downturns when capital becomes scarce, the startups that survive aren't necessarily those with the best ideas or largest war chests, but those with founders who can operate lean, generate revenue early, and keep the company alive through difficult conditions.

The Winter 2009 batch - which included Airbnb - was evaluated heavily on this criterion, and it produced some of Y Combinator's most successful companies.

## How It Works

### Cockroach Characteristics

**Operational Frugality**:
- Can build and iterate with minimal capital
- Founders willing to take low or no salary
- Creative approaches to office space, hiring, marketing

**Revenue Orientation**:
- Can charge customers early (not dependent on growth metrics alone)
- Business model allows for survival through sales
- Not exclusively reliant on future funding rounds

**Resourcefulness**:
- Find creative solutions to problems
- Make things happen with whatever is available
- Don't require perfect conditions to make progress

**Commitment**:
- Will do whatever it takes to survive
- Personal financial skin in the game
- No easy exit options

### The Airbnb Example

Airbnb was funded in the Winter 2009 batch during peak financial crisis. The founders demonstrated cockroach characteristics through:

- **The cereal box story**: Creating Obama O's and Cap'n McCain's cereal to fund the company
- **Maxed credit cards**: Personal financial commitment
- **Hosting guests themselves**: Doing things that don't scale to generate early revenue
- **Energy and determination**: Despite everyone hating their idea, they showed unstoppable drive

## How to Apply It

### For Founders

1. **Build your survival skills before you need them**
   - Learn to operate lean by default
   - Develop multiple potential revenue streams
   - Keep personal burn rate low

2. **Prove your cockroach credentials**
   - Show investors creative problem-solving examples
   - Demonstrate early revenue or path to revenue
   - Have a plan for various funding scenarios

3. **Prioritize survival over growth in downturns**
   - Cut burn rate aggressively and early
   - Focus on revenue-generating activities
   - Delay nice-to-haves indefinitely

### For Investors

1. **Adjust evaluation criteria for market conditions**
   - In boom times, bet on audacious growth
   - In downturns, weight survival skills heavily

2. **Look for cockroach signals**
   - Previous experience with bootstrapping
   - Scrappy background or projects
   - Demonstrated resourcefulness

3. **Ask revealing questions**
   - "How would you survive if you couldn't raise another round?"
   - "What's the fastest path to $10K MRR?"
   - "What have you built with almost no resources?"

### For Startups in Downturns

1. **Cut to survival mode fast** - Don't wait until crisis is obvious
2. **Focus on customers who pay** - Deemphasize free tier growth
3. **Renegotiate everything** - Vendors, contracts, salaries
4. **Generate revenue creatively** - Consulting, services, anything legal

## When to Use It

- Evaluating founders during economic uncertainty
- Making investment decisions in down markets
- Operating a startup when capital markets are tight
- Deciding whether to prioritize growth vs. survival
- Planning for multiple funding scenarios

## Nuances

- **This isn't always the right strategy**: In boom times with abundant capital, cockroach thinking can mean missing opportunities
- **Cockroach doesn't mean bad idea**: Airbnb was a "cockroach" startup with a billion-dollar idea
- **Balance survival with ambition**: Being too conservative can also kill a startup
- **Revenue quality matters**: Not all revenue is worth the distraction
