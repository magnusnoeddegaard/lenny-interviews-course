# New Bets Framework

> "Everyone can come up with a new idea... There is very little bureaucracy, again, thanks to having founder hands-on, we can easily get a green light on anything, start launching it quickly." - Dmitry Zlokazov

## What It Is

The New Bets Framework is Revolut's process for evaluating and launching new product ideas. It combines low-bureaucracy idea generation with rigorous quality standards and staged scaling—allowing anyone in the company to propose ideas while maintaining high product standards.

The framework solves a common tension: how do you move fast and experiment while also maintaining quality? Revolut's answer is to separate speed-to-first-version from quality-of-experience. You build quickly with a small team, but you don't scale until the product is polished.

The framework leverages Revolut's 50M+ user base as a scaling multiplier—once a product proves itself with a small group, distribution is nearly instant.

## How It Works

**Phase 1: Idea Proposal**
Anyone can propose a new bet. The pitch must cover:
- Market opportunity exists
- Business case is sound
- We can do it better than competitors (with specific leverage)
- Clear product concept
- Customer problem being solved

**Phase 2: Rapid Build**
- Assemble a small, lean team (just a few people)
- Build the first version quickly
- Focus on getting to market fast

**Phase 3: Polish Before Scale**
- Iterate intensively on the product
- Don't scale until quality bar is met
- Monitor retention and core metrics
- Make sure users love the product

**Phase 4: Scale via Distribution**
- Once metrics are strong, leverage the existing user base
- Products can instantly reach 50M+ users
- Growth becomes multiplication, not addition

**Key Principles:**
- Low bureaucracy for green-lighting (founder involvement accelerates decisions)
- Small teams for initial build
- High quality bar before scaling
- Distribution as a multiplier, not a challenge

## How to Apply It

1. **Create open ideation channels** - Let anyone propose new product ideas, regardless of role

2. **Standardize the pitch format** - Require consistent elements: market, business case, competitive advantage, concept, customer problem

3. **Minimize approval layers** - Get senior leadership (ideally founders) directly involved to fast-track decisions

4. **Start with skeleton crews** - Assign 2-5 people to build the first version, no more

5. **Set scaling gates based on quality and metrics** - Don't expand distribution until retention is strong and the product is polished

6. **Leverage existing distribution** - Plan for how proven products will reach your full user base

## When to Use It

**Strong fit:**
- Companies with large existing user bases that provide distribution
- Organizations with engaged founders who can fast-track decisions
- Product-led companies that can ship new features without sales cycles
- Companies building platform/ecosystem products with multiple adjacencies

**Consider alternatives when:**
- Early-stage startups without existing distribution
- Companies where new products require significant go-to-market investment
- Highly regulated industries where approval processes are unavoidable
- Markets where first-mover advantage is critical (speed over polish)
