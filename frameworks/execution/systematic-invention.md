# Systematic Invention

> "Inventiveness actually isn't that hard... The most straightforward way to invent is not to somehow come up with something completely new, but instead to put together two things that exist." - Ethan Evans

## What It Is

Systematic Invention is the practice of generating innovations through deliberate, structured effort rather than waiting for inspiration to strike. It counters the myth that invention requires special genius or luck.

Ethan Evans developed this approach after joining Amazon and realizing that the company's leadership principles (Think Big, Invent and Simplify) required inventiveness he didn't naturally possess. By applying this method, he accumulated over 70 patents during his 15 years at Amazon.

The core insight is that you don't need many good ideas to be seen as tremendously inventive. One good idea can take years to fully express—like Amazon Prime, which has been continuously refined for over 20 years. The Kindle, a decades-old idea, is still being improved.

## How It Works

**Prerequisites:**
1. **Develop expertise** - You must have domain knowledge in your area of invention. You can't invent cancer drugs without understanding biology and medicine. Be "something of a knowledgeable expert" in the field where you want to innovate.

**The Process:**
1. **Dedicate focused time** - Block two hours once a month (not a huge commitment). Get away from all devices. Sit in a room with the problem you want to solve.

2. **Force actual concentration** - People don't spend dedicated time thinking. They expect invention to "just come to them." Deliberately focus on what you know and how you can invent.

3. **Combine existing concepts** - The most productive invention method is combining two existing things in a new way:
   - Take a concept from one domain
   - Apply it to a problem in another domain
   - Ask: "Is there a way to combine these?"

**Example:**
Evans invented a drone delivery system where drones operate from a topless truck rather than a warehouse—essentially an "aircraft carrier for drones." The invention came from combining two existing concepts he knew well:
- Amazon's drone delivery initiative
- Military aircraft carrier operations (from his interest in military history)

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your expertise areas** - List the domains where you have deep knowledge
2. **Schedule monthly invention time** - Put 2 hours on your calendar each month with no distractions
3. **Choose a problem to focus on** - Select a specific challenge from your work
4. **Create an "adjacent knowledge" list** - Note unrelated fields you're interested in (hobbies, history, other industries)
5. **Run combination exercises** - For each adjacent interest, ask: "Is there something from this domain that could apply to my problem?"
6. **Document ideas immediately** - Capture any promising combinations before returning to regular work
7. **Express one idea over time** - Once you have a good idea, spend years refining and implementing it

## When to Use It

- When you need to demonstrate innovation capability for career advancement
- When you want to build a track record of creative problem-solving
- When facing problems that seem stuck with conventional approaches
- When you're in a role or company that values invention (like Amazon)
- When you have expertise in one domain and want to apply it to another
- When you need patentable innovations for your organization
