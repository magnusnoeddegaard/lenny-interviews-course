# Compounding Engineering

> "For every unit of work, you should make the next unit of work easier to do." - Dan Shipper

## What It Is

Compounding Engineering is an engineering philosophy developed by the Cora team at Every. The core principle is that every task you complete should also make future similar tasks easier. Instead of doing repetitive work at the same difficulty level forever, you invest a little extra effort to reduce the friction for next time.

This is especially powerful in an AI-assisted coding environment where engineers spend significant time writing PRDs and prompts for AI agents. Rather than writing each PRD from scratch at the same effort level, you build prompts that turn rambling thoughts into structured PRDs, automations that handle common patterns, and workflows that accumulate improvements over time.

## How It Works

The framework operates on a simple loop:

1. **Do the work** - Complete the task at hand
2. **Identify the pattern** - Notice what about this task is likely to repeat
3. **Build the speed-up** - Create a prompt, automation, or tool that makes the next instance easier
4. **Compound the gains** - As speed-ups accumulate, productivity multiplies

In practice at Every, this means:

- **Prompts that generate PRDs** from rambling thoughts
- **Slash commands in Claude Code** for repeated operations
- **Shared GitHub repositories** of reusable prompts and patterns
- **Style guides encoded into prompts** that apply automatically

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with awareness** - Notice when you're doing something for the second time. That's your signal to invest in making it easier.

2. **Look for the platonic ideal** - There's usually an ideal structure for any repeated task (like a PRD). Build toward that ideal.

3. **Build prompts, not just outputs** - Instead of writing the PRD, write the prompt that generates PRDs. Instead of doing the code review, build the prompt that does initial code reviews.

4. **Share with your team** - Individual speed-ups are good; shared speed-ups that help the whole team are great. Use shared repositories.

5. **Accept the upfront investment** - Sometimes you'll spend 30 minutes building something that saves 5 minutes per use. That's okay—it compounds.

## When to Use It

- When building with AI coding tools like Claude Code or Cursor
- When you notice yourself doing similar work repeatedly
- When onboarding new team members (good speed-ups help them go faster too)
- When setting up engineering team practices and norms
- When you feel like AI is making you more productive but you want to go even faster
