# Zero-to-One at Scale

> "The thing that I think a lot of large companies don't realize is that you can love something to death. And so with every new product, I'd rather do it out of the limelight, do it with the minimal resources and have the freedom to fail because success and failure really is... In a company, you end up getting cut if you're the long slog product." - Deb Liu

## What It Is

Zero-to-One at Scale is a framework for building new products within large companies. It addresses the unique challenges of internal innovation: too much scrutiny kills iteration, too many resources create bloat, and the "long slog" products get cut.

Deb Liu built multiple billion-dollar businesses at Facebook (games/payments, direct response ads, marketplace) by deliberately staying out of the limelight, working with minimal resources, and maintaining freedom to fail fast.

The framework recognizes that large-company innovation has a high failure rate—even successful companies have maybe 50% hit rate on new products. PMs who choose this path must have the resilience to accept that, in a year, they may have nothing to show but lessons learned.

## How It Works

**Why Big Companies Kill Innovation:**

1. **Too much attention** - Weekly check-ins, strategy reviews, and scrutiny prevent the iteration that new products need
2. **Too many resources** - Large teams create coordination overhead and raise stakes
3. **Impatience with iteration** - Leaders want to see "the perfect plan" instead of learning through failure
4. **Pruning cycles** - Products that haven't proven themselves get cut to focus on core priorities

**The Counterintuitive Approach:**

| Conventional Wisdom | Zero-to-One at Scale |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Get executive sponsorship | Stay out of the limelight |
| Staff up to move fast | Keep team minimal |
| Nail the strategy first | Expect to test 5-6 versions |
| Hit milestones on schedule | Iterate until something works |
| Report progress regularly | Build in obscurity until traction |

**The Career Trade-off:**

Building new products at scale is high-risk. ~50% of initiatives fail. The upside is running something significant if it works. The downside is having "nothing to show" after a year. Early-career PMs may want to build core skills first before taking this risk.

## How to Apply It

1. **Zig when others zag** - Find opportunities where the company isn't focused. Core products get the best people; new products get freedom.

2. **Stay under the radar** - Avoid becoming a "strategic priority" too early. Attention comes with scrutiny that kills iteration.

3. **Keep teams small** - Minimal resources = minimal coordination overhead = faster iteration. You can always add resources when something works.

4. **Plan for multiple iterations** - Deb's team tested 5-6 versions of their ads product before it took off. Build this into your timeline and expectations.

5. **Have a fallback** - When Deb's ads project looked like it might fail, she went back to running her old team while continuing to work on the new product. Having a safety net enables risk-taking.

6. **Accept the failure math** - If you're doing new products, accept that 50% won't work. The lessons from failures are valuable, but you need the resilience to keep going.

7. **Know when to declare success** - Once something takes off, shift from iteration mode to scaling mode. Then seek resources and attention.

## When to Use It

- Evaluating whether to take on an innovation role vs. core product
- Structuring a new product initiative within a large company
- Advising leadership on how to support internal innovation
- Deciding how much to resource an early-stage internal product
- Coaching PMs on innovation career paths
