# Self-Directed Deep Dives

> "You have to be very intentional to carve out time for exploratory work for deep dives because there are always more questions and more work to be done than hours in the day." - Jessica Lachs

## What It Is

A practice of deliberately protecting time for data teams to pursue self-directed exploratory analysis - investigating hunches, digging into anomalies, and finding opportunities that weren't on anyone's roadmap. This proactive, discovery-oriented work is where some of the most valuable insights come from, but it's the first thing that gets cut when reactive work piles up.

The framework recognizes that known requests have calculable expected value, while exploratory work has uncertain ROI. Without intentional protection, teams will always defer the uncertain work - and miss breakthrough opportunities.

## How It Works

**The Challenge:**
- There are always more questions than hours in the day
- Known requests feel safer (guaranteed to make someone happy)
- Exploratory work has uncertain ROI - it might yield gold or nothing
- Without protection, self-directed work gets squeezed out entirely

**The Solution:**
1. **Set explicit goals** around self-directed work and insights discovered
2. **Schedule protected time** - hackathons, "exploration days," or percentage allocations
3. **Create permission** - leadership must explicitly support and encourage this work
4. **Demonstrate value** - share wins from deep dives to justify continued investment

**Example: DoorDash Referral Deep Dive**

During a hackathon, the analytics team investigated why referrals performed below average as an acquisition channel. They:
- Actually tried referring each other
- Attempted to commit referral fraud (to understand vulnerabilities)
- Ordered cupcakes to the office to complete referral flows
- Discovered a bimodal distribution: great customers referring great customers + fraud/abuse dragging down averages

This led to fraud detection improvements, referral caps, and a much better understanding of the channel's true economics.

## How to Apply It

1. **Create protected time**: Schedule regular hackathons (quarterly or more) or allocate a percentage of time (e.g., 10-20%) for self-directed exploration

2. **Set goals around discovery**: Include metrics like "insights discovered" or "opportunities identified" in team goals to hold yourselves accountable

3. **Encourage following threads**: When analysts notice something odd while answering a question, encourage them to investigate rather than just moving on

4. **Document and share findings**: Create mechanisms to share discoveries - lunch-and-learns, write-ups, presentations to business partners

5. **Connect to roadmaps**: Show how deep dive insights have influenced strategy and roadmap decisions to justify continued investment

6. **Get business partner buy-in**: Help stakeholders understand that some of the most valuable insights come from this work, not from answering known questions

## When to Use It

- When your data team has become purely reactive and ticket-driven
- When you're not finding new opportunities organically
- When analysts feel stuck in a rut of repetitive reporting
- When you want to develop strategic thinking skills on your team
- When building a high-impact analytics organization
