# Doing Power

> "If you don't use what you learn, the learning will disappear." - Jeffrey Pfeffer

## What It Is

"Doing Power" is Jeffrey Pfeffer's practice-based learning methodology in his Stanford Paths to Power class. Instead of just teaching concepts, students must complete action-based assignments that force them to apply power principles in real situations.

The methodology is Pfeffer's solution to the Knowing-Doing Gap: the disconnect between what people know they should do and what they actually do. By requiring immediate action, the learning becomes embedded through experience rather than disappearing after the course ends.

As Pfeffer explains: "I don't say you're going to network like Keith Ferrazzi. You're going to begin where you can begin, and push yourself out of your comfort zone."

## How It Works

### The Core Principle

Every concept taught must be practiced immediately. The formula:

**Concept → Exercise → Coaching → Feedback → Iteration**

This mirrors how any skill is developed—tennis, languages, musical instruments. Reading about tennis doesn't make you a tennis player. You must practice with guidance.

### The Doing Power Project

Students' main assignment is to take a real action during the course that applies power principles. This is not a paper or analysis—it's an actual attempt to build or exercise power.

**Derek Kan's Example:**
Derek Kan's "Doing Power" project was to get appointed as head of economic policy for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. He was offered the job. Six years out of business school, he was running the $6 trillion US budget as deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget.

### Progressive Challenge

The methodology follows fitness training principles:
- Start with manageable challenges (15% beyond comfort zone)
- Increase difficulty gradually
- Never demand the impossible immediately

"I don't start by saying, you're going to network like Keith Ferrazzi... You're going to begin where you can begin."

## The Exercises

### Goal Setting (Week 1)
- Why are you here?
- What would success look like at the end of 10 weeks?
- What do you want to accomplish?

### Self-Assessment (Week 2)
- Get rated on seven attributes of power
- Identify strengths and weaknesses
- Create a development plan

### Resource Creation
- What resources can you create that give you leverage?
- Examples: creating awards, building platforms, producing valuable content
- One student created an award and gave it to Karlie Kloss

### Networking Exercise
- List 10 people who, if they knew you, would help your career
- For each person, figure out how you're going to meet them
- Options: dinners, email outreach, conferences, mutual connections

### Personal Brand Statement
- Write a personal brand statement
- Get feedback on it
- Rewrite it
- Answer: How do you want to be known?

### Acting with Power
- Record yourself giving a 60-90 second video presentation
- Share it with colleagues for feedback
- Called on in class to present
- Exercises based on real cases (e.g., "Do a better job than Tony Hayward representing BP")

## How to Apply It

### For Individual Learning

1. **Identify a skill you want to develop** (networking, presenting, negotiating, etc.)

2. **Create a specific exercise**: Not "I'll network more" but "I'll reach out to 5 specific people this week"

3. **Get accountability**: A coach, mentor, or peer who will hold you accountable

4. **Get feedback**: Record yourself, ask for specific input, measure results

5. **Iterate**: Do it again with feedback incorporated

### For Teaching Others

1. **Front-load the exercises**: Action happens early, not after all the theory

2. **Make exercises specific and time-bound**: "By Friday, you will have done X"

3. **Provide coaching infrastructure**: One-on-one feedback from experienced practitioners

4. **Create safe failure environments**: Low-stakes practice before high-stakes situations

5. **Require public commitment**: Sharing goals increases follow-through

## When to Use It

- When teaching any skill that requires behavior change
- When traditional training isn't producing results
- When you've learned concepts but aren't applying them
- When building new habits or capabilities
- When preparing for high-stakes situations (negotiations, presentations, career moves)
