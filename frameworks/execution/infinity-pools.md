# Infinity Pools

> "Basically if you can pull to refresh or if it streams, it's an infinity pool." - John Zeratsky

## What It Is

Infinity Pools are applications and services designed to provide an endless stream of content—they never run out, and there's always more to see. The name captures the key characteristic: unlike a finite resource, these pools refill automatically and infinitely.

The category includes obvious entertainment apps (TikTok, Instagram, Netflix, news sites) but also "productive" tools like email, Slack, and LinkedIn. The common thread: they're friction-free, expertly engineered to be compelling, and designed to keep you coming back.

When combined with the Busy Bandwagon (cultural pressure to be responsive), infinity pools create a destructive flywheel. You feel like you need to be on top of everything, and these products are perfectly designed to exploit that feeling while never letting you get to the bottom.

## How It Works

### The Pull-to-Refresh Test
If you can pull to refresh and get new content, it's an infinity pool. If it streams continuously, it's an infinity pool. The pool never empties—there's always more.

### Categories of Infinity Pools

**Entertainment**:
- Social media (TikTok, Instagram, Twitter/X, Facebook)
- Streaming services (Netflix, YouTube, Spotify)
- News sites and apps
- Games with infinite content

**"Productive" Infinity Pools**:
- Email (always more messages coming)
- Slack/Teams (always more channels, threads)
- LinkedIn (business-justified endless scroll)
- News feeds disguised as industry updates

### Why They're So Powerful
These products are designed by brilliant people whose job is making them irresistible:
- Friction-free access (one tap away)
- Variable reward schedules (sometimes great content, sometimes not—like slot machines)
- Infinite content (never "done")
- Social validation loops
- Dopamine-driven engagement

### The Lord of the Rings Effect
Jake Knapp compares the phone to the Ring in Lord of the Rings—you want to reach for it without even realizing it. Frodo says "I didn't even realize I did it." That's exactly how infinity pools work on our attention.

## How to Apply It

The solution isn't willpower—it's environmental design. Create barriers:

1. **Delete apps** from your phone for your worst infinity pools
2. **Log out** of services so there's friction to log back in
3. **Use two-factor authentication** as an additional speed bump
4. **Disable feeds** using browser extensions (like disabling LinkedIn's feed)
5. **Move your phone** to a different room when you need focus
6. **Cancel the internet** in your office space (extreme but effective)

### The Candy Metaphor
Imagine your highlight (the meaningful thing you want to do) as a great sandwich 10 feet away. The infinity pools are little candies vibrating right next to your face. Of course you'll eat the candy—it's right there and feels good immediately. Push the candy away so the sandwich is closer.

## When to Use It

- When naming what's actually stealing your attention
- When designing your phone and computer environment
- When explaining distraction to colleagues or team
- When evaluating new apps ("Is this going to become an infinity pool for me?")
- When creating team communication norms
