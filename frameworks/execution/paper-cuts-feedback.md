# Paper Cuts (Crying Octopus)

> "We put a little button in every single developer tool at Stripe. It is an emoji of an octopus that is crying. If you click it, it makes it possible to just type in what's gone wrong. Then we have our developer productivity team read all of those and use them to prioritize what they're up to." - David Singleton

## What It Is

Paper Cuts is Stripe's frictionless problem reporting system for internal developer tools. A crying octopus emoji button appears in every developer tool. When clicked, it opens a simple text field where developers can immediately describe what went wrong. These reports go directly to the developer productivity team who use them to prioritize their roadmap.

The key insight is that reducing friction in problem reporting dramatically increases the volume and quality of feedback. When it takes only a single click and a few words to report an issue, developers actually do it in the moment rather than forgetting about it or deciding it's not worth the effort.

## How It Works

1. **Universal presence**: The feedback button appears in every developer tool, always in the same place and with the same visual (crying octopus emoji).

2. **Minimal friction**: One click opens a text field. No forms, no categories, no required fields - just describe what happened.

3. **Direct routing**: Reports go directly to the team responsible for developer productivity.

4. **Active monitoring**: The receiving team reads every report and uses them to prioritize their work.

5. **Named for impact**: "Paper cuts" captures the idea that small irritations compound to significant pain over time.

## How to Apply It

Actionable steps for implementing Paper Cuts feedback:

1. **Choose a memorable, universal trigger** - A distinctive emoji or icon that appears everywhere and becomes recognizable
2. **Make reporting instant** - One click to open, free text to describe, one click to send. No friction.
3. **Route to owners** - Ensure reports go directly to people who can act on them
4. **Read everything** - Someone needs to actually review every report, even if briefly
5. **Close the loop** - Consider notifying reporters when their issue is addressed
6. **Prioritize from the data** - Use paper cut volume and severity to guide roadmap decisions

## When to Use It

- For internal tools where you want continuous improvement based on user feedback
- When you suspect friction exists but don't know where
- When you want to empower every team member to contribute to tool quality
- When building developer experience or internal platform teams
- When other feedback mechanisms feel too heavyweight
