# Internal Virality for Alignment

> "As the company gets bigger, you can actually create alignment by causing internal virality. If there's enough people in the company, it actually starts acting like a consumer base might. If you share something interesting with someone, they will share it with somebody else because they think it's interesting and you can actually create virality inside a company." - Gaurav Misra

## What It Is

A technique for creating organizational alignment at scale by building prototypes so compelling they spread organically within the company. Instead of using meetings, documents, and stakeholder management to get buy-in, you build something people can try—and let internal word of mouth do the alignment work.

This emerged from Snap's need to maintain innovation velocity as the company grew. Traditional alignment methods (stakeholder meetings, buy-in conversations) don't scale linearly—they scale with the square of the people involved. Internal virality bypasses this by using the same mechanism products use to spread externally.

## How It Works

**The insight:**
Large companies behave like consumer markets. With enough employees, the dynamics of information spread mirror external virality:
- Interesting things get shared
- Excitement compounds through word of mouth
- Leadership hears about what matters through organic channels

**The process at Snap:**
1. Design engineering team builds prototype products
2. Prototypes are embedded in actual Snapchat builds
3. These test builds are shared internally
4. Compelling prototypes spread organically
5. Leadership notices when things blow up internally

**The effect:**
> "Day after day we would hear from engineers, then managers, then VPs, then eventually from Evan being like, 'Oh my God, everyone's talking about this. Why am I the last one to hear about it?'"

This creates natural prioritization. Ideas that genuinely excite people get attention; those that don't fade quietly.

## How to Apply It

1. **Build functional prototypes** - Not decks or documents. The thing needs to be usable, even if rough. At Snap, they embedded prototypes in the actual app

2. **Enable sharing** - Make it easy for someone who's excited to show someone else. Test builds, internal links, screenshots—whatever works for your product

3. **Seed strategically** - Share initial prototypes with people likely to be excited AND well-connected within the organization

4. **Monitor organic spread** - Track when things start spreading beyond where you seeded them. That's your signal of genuine excitement

5. **Let leadership come to you** - "It would create instant alignment across the company of 'this is exciting, this is something that we want to get behind.' And everyone would be asking, 'When are we doing this? When is this happening?'"

6. **Don't pre-announce** - The power comes from organic discovery, not from promises or roadmap items

## When to Use It

This approach works well when:
- Your company is large enough for internal network effects (hundreds+ employees)
- The product is something employees can actually use or demo
- Traditional alignment is becoming a bottleneck to innovation
- You have capability to build real prototypes quickly (design engineering, rapid prototyping)

It's harder to apply when:
- The company is too small for viral dynamics
- The product is B2B or enterprise (harder for employees to experience as users)
- Prototypes require significant infrastructure investment
- The culture discourages informal sharing or bottom-up ideas
