# GACCS Framework

> "This is just a marketing brief that I recommend you do before you make anything big in marketing or do any big projects." - Emily Kramer

## What It Is

A lightweight planning document for marketing initiatives that ensures alignment before work begins. GACCS stands for:

- **G**oals - What are we trying to achieve?
- **A**udience - Who are we trying to reach?
- **C**reative - What unique angle or content will we create?
- **C**hannels - How will we distribute this?
- **S**takeholders - Who's the DRI and who needs to weigh in?

The framework prevents the common failure mode of marketing teams sharing finished work (like a blog post for a product launch) only to hear "this is the wrong audience" or "this misses the point." By sharing the brief upfront, you get buy-in early and move faster later.

## How It Works

### G - Goals
Define what success looks like with measurable outcomes:
- Traffic, signups, conversions
- Pipeline influenced
- Brand awareness metrics
- Specific launch objectives

**Avoid activity goals** like "write 10 blog posts." Goals should measure impact, not output.

### A - Audience
Specify who you're trying to reach:
- Target persona(s)
- Stage in their journey
- Pain points being addressed
- Why they should care

### C - Creative (First C)
The unique angle that makes this stand out:
- High-level messaging approach
- What makes this different from competitors
- Key value propositions
- Tone and style direction

### C - Channels (Second C)
How you'll get this in front of the audience:
- Distribution plan (email, social, paid, SEO, etc.)
- Channel-specific adaptations
- Timeline and cadence
- Budget allocation

### S - Stakeholders
Who's involved and what's their role:
- **DRI (Directly Responsible Individual)** - Who owns success?
- **Contributors** - Who's doing the work?
- **Approvers** - Who needs to sign off?
- **Informed** - Who should know but doesn't need to weigh in?

Include product people, sales, and other cross-functional partners here.

## How to Apply It

1. **Before any significant marketing initiative**: Create a GACCS doc before starting work. "Significant" = anything that will take more than a few hours or involve multiple people.

2. **For product launches**:
   - Product manager shares what's being built and why
   - Marketing comes back with the GACCS
   - Product reviews and provides feedback on audience, messaging, channels
   - Alignment happens BEFORE creative work begins

3. **Share at the right level**: GACCS is high-level strategy, not detailed execution. It should fit on one page. Don't include full copy or detailed designs—those come after alignment.

4. **Update as you learn**: If the strategy shifts during execution, update the GACCS and re-share with stakeholders. It's a living document until launch.

## When to Use It

- **Product launches** - Align marketing and product before creating launch assets
- **Content campaigns** - Get buy-in on a content series before writing
- **Brand initiatives** - Align on big-picture direction before design work
- **Any cross-functional marketing project** - Ensure everyone's on the same page
