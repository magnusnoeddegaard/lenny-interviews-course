# Go Slow to Go Fast

> "Go slow to go fast. I think, for me, it's about that. Sometimes people have a tendency to rushing into things and especially, I think, in startups... you have this urgency is important, but then sometimes you have too much urgency and you are rushing things, and what happens is that you rushed it and now you need to come back to fix it. I think sometimes I like to think that you should take some time to actually think about it and, 'What are you going to do?' And then do it. In the end, it's going to be faster that way than going back and forth and fixing things." - Karri Saarinen

## What It Is

Go Slow to Go Fast is an execution philosophy that recognizes the paradox of speed: rushing creates more work, while thoughtful pacing often leads to faster overall results. The time invested in thinking before acting prevents the rework, corrections, and reversals that come from hasty decisions.

This doesn't mean being slow or deliberate about everything. It means calibrating speed appropriately—taking time to think when that investment will save time later. The goal is not slowness but net efficiency, avoiding the false economy of rushing into work that needs to be redone.

For Karri Saarinen, this is a personal motto that he applies both to Linear's product development and to his own work as a leader.

## How It Works

**The Cost of Rushing:**
- Decisions made without full understanding need to be revisited
- Features built without proper scoping require rework
- Communication done hastily creates confusion to clean up later
- Technical debt accumulates when expedience trumps quality

**The Investment in Thinking:**
- Time spent understanding the problem reduces wrong solutions
- Proper scoping prevents scope creep and pivots
- Clear communication upfront prevents misalignment
- Quality built in means less fixing later

**The Paradox:**
What feels fast (jumping into action immediately) often isn't. What feels slow (pausing to think) often leads to faster completion of the actual goal.

## How to Apply It

1. **Pause before major decisions** - Before committing to a direction, ask: "Do we understand this well enough?" The time to think is before action, not after problems emerge.

2. **Invest in understanding the problem** - Rushing to solutions without understanding problems leads to solving the wrong thing.

3. **Scope before building** - Time spent defining scope prevents the much larger time cost of mid-project pivots.

4. **Communicate clearly the first time** - Investing in clear communication upfront prevents the back-and-forth of misunderstanding.

5. **Build quality from the start** - Cutting corners to move faster often creates more total work.

6. **Distinguish real urgency from perceived urgency** - Not everything that feels urgent actually is. Learn to recognize which situations truly require speed.

**When to still move fast:**
- Reversible decisions (you can course-correct easily)
- Time-sensitive opportunities (real deadlines, not manufactured ones)
- Learning exercises (speed of iteration matters more than perfection)
- Situations where waiting has its own costs

## When to Use It

**Apply this principle when:**
- Making significant decisions with lasting consequences
- Starting substantial projects or features
- Communicating important information to teams
- Feeling pressure to rush that isn't externally driven
- Noticing patterns of rework or correction

**The startup context:**
Karri acknowledges that startups value urgency—and that urgency is important. But excessive urgency, where everything is treated as an emergency, leads to rushing that creates more work. The goal is calibrated speed, not constant haste.

**Counterbalances:**
This philosophy pairs with Linear's practice of shipping early and iterating. The "go slow" is about thinking; once you've thought, you should execute quickly. It's not an excuse for analysis paralysis.

**Examples:**
- Taking a day to scope a feature properly vs. jumping straight to building
- Having one thorough conversation vs. several clarifying ones
- Fixing code quality as you go vs. accumulating technical debt
- Understanding customer needs deeply vs. guessing and pivoting
