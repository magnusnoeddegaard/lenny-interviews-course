# WeDash (Customer Empathy Program)

> "We have a program called WeDash, where, four times a year, all employees are required to go do deliveries... For me, it's just about getting out and experiencing the product. I almost always find something that's broken." - Keith Yandell

## What It Is

A mandatory program where all employees regularly experience the product from the customer's perspective. At DoorDash, every employee—from executives to engineers—must complete at least four delivery shifts per year. This isn't optional or ceremonial; it's a core requirement built into the company culture.

The program serves multiple purposes: it builds genuine empathy for customers and delivery drivers, surfaces real product issues that data might miss, and acts as a cultural filter during hiring. People unwilling to hop in their car and deliver McDonald's probably aren't a fit for a customer-obsessed culture.

## How It Works

### Core Structure

**Frequency**: At least 4 times per year (quarterly)
**Duration**: Full delivery shift or equivalent
**Participants**: All employees, including executives

### Alternative Paths

Not everyone can do deliveries for various reasons. DoorDash offers alternatives that achieve the same goal:
- Customer support shifts (answering real customer issues)
- Restaurant-side operations
- Other front-line experiences

The key is making employees engage directly with the customer experience, not just read about it in dashboards.

### Finding and Reporting Issues

After each session, employees share what they found:
- Bugs and product issues go to dedicated Slack channels
- Feedback goes directly to relevant product teams
- Patterns across reports get escalated

Keith describes finding a routing bug during a delivery: "It wasn't routing you necessarily the fastest route. It was going using straight line as opposed to road."

### The Alice Story

Keith's 8-year-old daughter demonstrated the program's power when she called CEO Tony Xu during a WeDash to report a broken experience: an 18.5-mile delivery for a sandwich and coffee. Tony sent an email to the product org that same day, and they started working on a fix. That bias to action is the point.

## How to Apply It

1. **Make it mandatory, not optional** - Voluntary programs get deprioritized. Make it a cultural expectation with a specific cadence (quarterly works well).

2. **Include everyone, especially executives** - Leadership participation signals this isn't busy work. Keith does it monthly, often with his daughters.

3. **Create alternative paths** - Not everyone can do every customer activity. Ensure there are equivalent ways to achieve empathy for those who can't participate in the primary activity.

4. **Set up reporting channels** - Create dedicated Slack channels or systems for sharing findings. Make it easy to surface issues.

5. **Action what you find** - Nothing kills the program faster than reporting issues that disappear into a void. Close the loop visibly.

6. **Use it as a hiring filter** - Be explicit during interviews that this is expected. It weeds out people who won't thrive in a customer-obsessed culture.

## When to Use It

- **Building consumer products** - Any company where customer experience directly determines success
- **Marketplace businesses** - Where you need empathy for multiple sides (customers, suppliers, operators)
- **Scaling rapidly** - As teams grow, direct customer contact decreases; this maintains it
- **Detecting blind spots** - Data shows what happens; this shows why and how it feels
- **Culture reinforcement** - Keeps everyone grounded in customer reality regardless of role

## The Payoff

- Surfaces product issues that data and metrics miss
- Builds genuine empathy that influences better decisions
- Filters for cultural fit during hiring
- Keeps executives connected to ground truth
- Creates shared experiences across the company
