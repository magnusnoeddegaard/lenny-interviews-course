# Quality, Features, Deadline - Choose Two

> "For a new launch, you got quality, features, deadline, choose two." - Dylan Field (attributed to Evan Wallace, Figma co-founder)

## What It Is

A product launch framework that makes explicit the fundamental trade-off in software development. You cannot simultaneously maximize quality, feature set, and launch timing—something has to give.

Unlike physical products where quality must be baked in from the start, software's iterative nature means you can strategically choose which constraint to relax based on your situation. The framework forces clarity about what you're optimizing for.

## How It Works

**The Three Constraints:**

1. **Quality** - Polish, craft, reliability, user experience excellence
2. **Features** - Breadth of functionality, use cases covered
3. **Deadline** - Time to market, launch timing

**The Trade-offs:**

| Choice | What You Get | What You Sacrifice |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Quality + Features | A polished, complete product | Launch timing (ships later) |
| Quality + Deadline | A polished, minimal product | Feature breadth (ships less) |
| Features + Deadline | A feature-rich but rough product | Polish (ships buggy) |

## How to Apply It

1. **Acknowledge the trade-off explicitly** - Don't pretend you can have it all. Choose your two priorities consciously.

2. **Features + Deadline can work in software** - Unlike physical products, you can "ship it with features and deadline and then improve it iteratively over time." The key is having a plan to add quality later.

3. **Quality + Deadline for strong launches** - When you choose quality and deadline, you ship with a "minimum feature set" but maintain your quality bar. Good for products where first impressions matter.

4. **Quality + Features when timing is flexible** - If there's no market pressure, invest in making it complete and polished. But be wary—this can lead to over-building.

5. **Know your minimum bar** - "Sometimes you need to at least have a minimum bar of quality for the things you have." Even when sacrificing quality overall, protect the core experience.

## Examples at Figma

- **FigJam**: Shipped "incredibly fast" (Features + Deadline), then iterated on quality
- **Dev Mode**: Took much longer because they "had to keep iterating and building it" (Quality + Features) to truly understand the developer user
- **Figma Slides**: Shipped quickly to get market feedback

## When to Use It

- Starting a new product or major feature
- Planning a launch timeline
- Resolving debates about scope vs. polish vs. timing
- When stakeholders want everything—use this to force prioritization
