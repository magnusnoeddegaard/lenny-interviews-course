# Five-Day Alignment Rule

> "You should hold your managers accountable. In five days if someone has something that they haven't been able to escalate and solve, that's probably then on the next level of person." - Hari Srinivasan

## What It Is

The Five-Day Alignment Rule is a simple escalation policy used at LinkedIn: if a decision or blocker hasn't been resolved within five business days, it automatically escalates to the next management level. This creates a forcing function that prevents decisions from languishing in limbo while also putting clear accountability on managers to unblock their teams.

The rule acknowledges that in complex ecosystems—where multiple products, marketplaces, and business models intersect—there will inevitably be ties, conflicts, and unclear ownership. Rather than letting these fester, the five-day clock keeps things moving.

## How It Works

The mechanism is straightforward:

1. A team member identifies a blocker or decision that needs resolution
2. They attempt to resolve it through normal channels (direct communication, RAPID framework, etc.)
3. If unresolved after five days, it automatically escalates to their manager
4. The manager now owns getting it unblocked within five days
5. If still unresolved, it escalates again to the next level

The rule works because it creates **predictable accountability**. Everyone knows the clock is ticking, which motivates faster resolution. It also gives teams explicit permission to escalate without feeling like they're being difficult—the process requires it.

## How to Apply It

1. **Track blockers explicitly** - Maintain visibility into what's stuck and when it started
2. **Communicate the clock** - When raising an issue, be clear: "This has been unresolved for X days"
3. **Escalate without guilt** - The rule gives you permission; use it
4. **Managers: own the escalation** - When something lands on your desk, you have five days
5. **Create the right urgency** - The goal isn't to punish but to maintain momentum

## When to Use It

- When decisions are stuck between teams or functions
- When cross-functional alignment is blocking progress
- When you're waiting on input from stakeholders who aren't responding
- When "more discussion" keeps delaying a clear decision
- In any complex ecosystem where multiple interests need to be balanced
