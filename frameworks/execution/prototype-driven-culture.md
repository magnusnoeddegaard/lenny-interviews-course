# Prototype-Driven Culture

> "We are a very prototype-driven culture. It goes back to the 'assume you don't know' ethos. We try a lot of experiments, and we try them related to product features, related to how we work together, related to the stories we tell." - Josh Miller

## What It Is

Prototype-Driven Culture extends the concept of prototyping beyond product features to include organizational structure, processes, and business practices. Just as you'd prototype a new feature before committing to it, you prototype new ways of working, team structures, and communication approaches.

The key insight is that you can apply an experimental mindset to everything about how a company operates—not just what it builds. The membership team, storytelling team, no-PM structure, building in public—at The Browser Company, all of these are explicitly framed as "experiments we're trying" rather than "the right way to do things."

This creates psychological safety to try new things and permission to change course if they don't work.

## How It Works

The culture operates on several principles:

1. **Everything is an experiment**: Treat organizational decisions, processes, and practices as hypotheses to test, not permanent structures

2. **Expect failure**: Frame experiments with the assumption they might not work. "This is a prototype" means "we're ready to change this"

3. **Learn from reality**: Instead of debating what will work, try things and observe what actually happens

4. **Apply to all dimensions**: Prototype product features (obvious), but also team structures, communication methods, values statements, business practices

5. **Share the framing**: When explaining decisions, explicitly call them experiments. This manages expectations and invites feedback.

## How to Apply It

1. **Name your experiments**: When trying something new, explicitly label it as a prototype or experiment ("We're trying a new approach to X")

2. **Set review points**: Decide in advance when you'll evaluate if the experiment is working

3. **Define success criteria**: What would make this experiment worth keeping? What would make you abandon it?

4. **Create permission to fail**: Make it safe for experiments to not work out. Failure is learning, not shame.

5. **Apply to sacred cows**: Don't just prototype small things. Prototype team structure, values, even business model elements.

6. **Share learnings**: When an experiment fails, share what you learned publicly (with team or broader audience)

## Examples from The Browser Company

- **Membership Team**: Experimental org structure consolidating support/success/research
- **Storytelling Team**: Experimental approach to marketing as narrative
- **No PMs**: Experimental org structure where PM is a role, not a title
- **Building in Public**: Experimental transparency as trust-building
- **Values as Road Trip Essay**: Experimental approach to communicating culture

## When to Use It

- When you're uncertain which approach will work best
- When industry standard practices feel wrong but you don't have proof yet
- When building something genuinely new where past playbooks may not apply
- When you want to create a learning culture rather than a "we know the answer" culture
- When you need to try things that might not scale (try them, then evaluate)

## Cautions

Josh Miller is explicit about limitations:

- "I have no idea how this scales to 500 people"
- "By no means do I think we're perfect"
- "This is probably the one I'll come crawling back... being, 'Lenny, you were right. It all blew up!'"

The humility is part of the culture—prototypes are not meant to be defended, they're meant to be evaluated.
