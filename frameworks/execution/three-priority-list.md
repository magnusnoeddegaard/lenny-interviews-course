# Three Priority List

> "I don't have a to-do list of 20 things. I try to have a to-do list of three of the most important highest leverage things that could have impact broadly across the company and then try to let that one top thing marinate and chew on it." - JM Nickels

## What It Is

The Three Priority List is a radical simplification of task management. Instead of maintaining long to-do lists, you identify only the three most important, highest-leverage things that would have broad impact. Everything else becomes a backlog you can occasionally scan.

This approach connects to the "top idea in mind" concept: your brain continues to work on whatever you're focused on, even when you're not actively thinking about it. By limiting to three priorities, you ensure your mental resources go to the right problems.

JM Nickels contrasts this with complex systems like GTD, which he found too structured. The simple truth is: there are three things to do next, plus a backlog. That gets you most of the way.

## How It Works

**The Problem with Long Lists:**
- 20 items compete for attention
- Mental energy spent on prioritization, not execution
- Low-leverage tasks crowd out high-leverage thinking
- Constant context-switching prevents deep work

**The Solution:**
- Identify three things maximum as active priorities
- These should be high-leverage, broad-impact items
- Everything else goes to a backlog you scan occasionally
- Let the top priority "marinate" in your mind

**The Connection to Deep Work:**
- Genius insights come from sustained focus
- Shower ideas, run ideas, hike ideas all come from marinating
- You can't marinate 20 things; you can marinate three

## How to Apply It

1. **Daily practice** - At the start of each day, write down your three most important things. Everything else can wait.

2. **Weekly practice** - At the start of each week, identify the three things that would make this week a success.

3. **Test for leverage** - Ask: "Would this have broad impact across the company?" If not, is it really a top 3?

4. **Create a backlog** - Everything else goes on a list you scan periodically. It's not lost, just not active.

5. **Let it marinate** - Give your top priority the space to develop in your mind. Go for walks without podcasts. Let ideas emerge.

## When to Use It

- When overwhelmed by too many tasks
- When important work keeps getting crowded out by urgent work
- When you feel scattered and unfocused
- During planning (daily, weekly, quarterly)
- When coaching team members on prioritization
- When complex productivity systems feel too heavy
