# Levels of Quality

> "There is the, does the thing work? Does it provide some sort of value proposition? It like executes on its job. That's baseline quality. Next is that, does it do it exceedingly well? Is it error-free? Then beyond that, level three, level four, level five, does it exceed expectations and it does something that you weren't even seeking for as a user?" - Katie Dill

## What It Is

Quality isn't binary—it exists on a spectrum with distinct levels. Understanding these levels helps teams have clearer conversations about what they're aiming for and what they're willing to accept for different features or products.

Katie Dill describes quality as a progression from basic functionality through error-free execution to exceeding user expectations. The levels should be calibrated based on user expectations—not internal definitions—because users experience quality in relation to alternatives and competition.

The key insight is that different features, products, or market contexts may warrant different quality levels. A car with no competition (like the first automobile) can have baseline quality, but a car competing in today's market needs exceptional quality down to the stitching and door sound.

## How It Works

**Level 1: Does it work?**
The thing executes its basic job. It provides the stated value proposition. This is minimum viable product territory.

**Level 2: Error-free**
The product works consistently without bugs. It handles edge cases. It doesn't break.

**Level 3: Does it well**
The product doesn't just work—it works smoothly. The experience is polished and professional.

**Level 4: Exceeds expectations**
The product does things the user didn't explicitly ask for but appreciates. Small touches that create delight.

**Level 5: Surprisingly great**
The product creates genuine wow moments. Users can't help but tell others about it.

## How to Apply It

1. **Define quality targets by context** - Not everything needs level 5 quality. Use your scarce resources strategically by determining what quality level each feature or product area warrants.

2. **Use user expectations as the calibration** - Quality should be judged relative to what users expect based on competition and alternatives in the market.

3. **Audit current state honestly** - Walk through your product and honestly assess what level each area has reached.

4. **Create a shared vocabulary** - Using numbered levels helps teams have objective conversations about quality without defensiveness.

5. **Prioritize strategically** - Moving from level 1 to level 2 is different work than moving from level 4 to level 5. Plan accordingly.

## When to Use It

- During planning when deciding how much to invest in polish vs. shipping
- In design reviews to calibrate feedback expectations
- When building a new product area to set explicit quality targets
- During retrospectives to assess whether you hit your quality goals
- When advocating for additional time to raise quality
