# Don't Be Afraid to Reset

> "Definitely don't be afraid to reset... going back to the abstraction system way of problem solving... you can create progress through better abstractions. And that thing compounds faster, can catch up to all the things you build much quicker than you ever thought." - Ivan Zhao

## What It Is

Don't Be Afraid to Reset is the principle that the sunk cost of past work is usually smaller than it appears, because superior foundations can catch up to and surpass months or years of accumulated progress surprisingly quickly.

Notion reset multiple times during their "lost years." They threw away entire codebases, laid off the team down to two people, moved to Japan, and rebuilt from scratch on better foundations. Each reset felt scary because of the accumulated work being discarded. But each time, the better abstraction allowed them to recover what they'd lost and then accelerate past it.

The insight draws from computing history. Smalltalk—a foundational programming system that influenced Notion—was built on perhaps a hundred lines of kernel code. From that tiny base, complex behavior emerged. The right primitives, like mathematical axioms, compound into enormous capability. If you find those right primitives, you can catch up to everything you'd built on the wrong ones, and then go far beyond.

## How It Works

The framework operates on a counterintuitive truth about compounding:

1. **Linear progress on wrong foundations** accumulates slowly and hits diminishing returns. Each step forward gets harder as technical debt and complexity grow.

2. **Exponential progress on right foundations** starts slower but accelerates. The right abstraction makes each subsequent step easier, not harder.

3. **The crossover point** comes faster than intuition suggests. What took years on the old foundation might take months on the new one.

4. **Momentum is a trap** - We often stick with wrong foundations because we have momentum. But momentum on the wrong path just takes you further from where you need to be.

## How to Apply It

1. **Recognize when you're on the wrong foundation** - Signs include: bugs from unclear sources (is it your code or the library?), increasing difficulty with each new feature, code that "doesn't fit" with the rest of the system.

2. **Estimate the reset correctly** - Your intuition will overweight sunk cost. Calculate: how long would it take to rebuild the core functionality on a better foundation? Often it's months, not years.

3. **Preserve what you learned** - Resetting the code doesn't mean resetting your knowledge. You now know what works, what users need, and what pitfalls to avoid.

4. **Use the scenery change** - Notion moved to Japan during one reset, subletting their SF apartment and actually making money while coding in a new environment. A change of context can help psychologically.

5. **Cut the team if needed** - Notion went from five people to two for their major reset. Smaller teams move faster during rebuilds. Don't carry overhead during a reset.

## When to Use It

- When your technical foundation is fighting you rather than helping you
- When each new feature takes longer than the last
- When you can't tell if bugs are yours or the underlying system's
- When you've discovered a fundamentally better approach
- When morale is low because progress feels impossible
