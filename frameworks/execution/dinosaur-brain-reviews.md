# Dinosaur Brain Product Reviews

> "Assume that executives have a little tiny dinosaur brain. We all have a little brontosaurus brain and we can really only hold three facts at the same time." - Ami Vora

## What It Is

Dinosaur Brain Product Reviews is a framework for making product reviews effective by acknowledging a fundamental asymmetry: the person presenting has deep context, while the reviewers have broad context but shallow depth on any one topic.

The common mistake is treating reviews as information transfer—presenting all the data and expecting leaders to process it and make decisions. But leaders are looking across many things simultaneously. They can't go as deep as you on everything that crosses their desk.

The framework flips the dynamic: **you own the recommendation, your manager owns the context**. Your job is to do the analysis and come with a clear recommendation. Their job is to add context you don't have—patterns from other parts of the company, industry trends, upcoming priorities.

## How It Works

**The Wrong Approach:**
- Present all available information
- Hope the smart people in the room will process it
- Let them make the decision

**The Right Approach:**
1. Do all the analysis yourself
2. Form a clear recommendation with conviction
3. Present minimal information needed to support that recommendation
4. Let leaders add context, pattern-match, and identify conflicts
5. Walk away with principles for future decisions, not just this answer

**The Roles:**
- **You (the presenter)**: Own depth, analysis, and the recommendation
- **Leader (the reviewer)**: Own breadth, pattern-matching, and context

## How to Apply It

1. **Write everything, then cut almost all of it** - Do your full analysis, then strip it down to the minimum needed to make a clean recommendation.

2. **Lead with your recommendation** - Don't hide your opinion in a sea of data. Say "looked at all the data, three analyses suggest X, one suggests Y, we think Y is inaccurate or worth the risk. Let's do X."

3. **Be opinionated and own it** - The recommendation should come from conviction. Do whatever you need to build that conviction first.

4. **Seek principles, not answers** - The goal isn't to get this one decision made. It's to leave with principles for making similar decisions in the future without needing another review.

5. **Keep it short and informal** - Fewer people, less formality, faster iteration. "I'd rather have a less formal conversation faster than a formal conversation and lose three weeks."

## The Principle Exchange

The key insight is that product reviews should be calibration sessions, not decision factories:

> "What you don't want is to come to a product review for every single decision that you want to make. Instead, what you want is to come to a product review with one decision, but the goal of that decision is to walk out with principles about how to make these decisions in the future."

After the review, you should understand:
- Why you made this decision
- What trade-offs you're accepting
- Who you're optimizing for
- What timeline you're thinking about
- What risk level you're willing to tolerate

This means you don't have to come back for similar decisions.

## When to Use It

- Any product review or executive presentation
- Skip-level meetings where you're presenting to your manager's manager
- Strategy discussions with leadership
- Any situation where you're tempted to "show all the data"

## Common Mistakes

- **Information dumping**: Presenting everything because you're unsure what matters
- **Hiding behind data**: "The analyses suggest..." instead of "I recommend..."
- **Seeking decisions instead of principles**: Getting this one answer instead of the framework for future answers
- **Over-preparing the wrong things**: Making slides pretty instead of forming conviction
