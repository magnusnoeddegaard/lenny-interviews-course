# GIST Model

> "GIST is not a brand new invention. It's a meta framework that puts in place a lot of existing methodologies. It's based on lean startup, on design thinking, product discovery, growth. There's a lot of all of these things here. It just tries to put them all into one framework or one model." - Itamar Gilad

## What It Is

The GIST Model stands for Goals, Ideas, Steps, and Tasks - four interconnected layers that help organizations move from opinion-based to evidence-guided product development. It emerged from Itamar Gilad's experience at Google, where he observed the contrast between failed opinion-driven projects like Google+ (1000+ person team, shut down in 2019) and successful evidence-guided ones like Gmail's tabbed inbox (now used by 1.8 billion users).

The model addresses a common dysfunction: planning happens in one world (managers, stakeholders, roadmaps) while execution happens in another (Agile teams focused on moving tickets). PMs get stuck in the middle, exhausted by trying to bridge this gap. GIST creates a unified system where everyone works toward the same evidence-guided outcomes.

## How It Works

**Goals Layer**: Define what you're trying to achieve, not what you're going to build. Goals should include:
- A North Star Metric measuring value delivered to users (e.g., WhatsApp: messages sent; Airbnb: nights booked)
- A Top Business KPI measuring value captured (revenue, market share)
- These two metrics form a "value exchange loop" - delivering value to capture value

**Ideas Layer**: Generate and evaluate hypothetical ways to achieve the goals. Key principles:
- Ideas come from everywhere: founders, teams, research, competitors
- Evaluate using frameworks like ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease)
- Use the Confidence Meter to honestly assess how much evidence supports each idea
- Avoid letting "highest paid person's opinion" (HiPPO) dominate

**Steps Layer**: Implement ideas while validating them simultaneously. This is where learning and building happen together:
- Assessment: alignment check, business modeling, ICE analysis, stakeholder conversations
- Fact-finding: data analysis, surveys, competitive analysis, user interviews
- Tests: fake door tests, Wizard of Oz tests, usability tests, fish food (team testing), dog food, betas
- Experiments: A/B tests, multivariate tests with control groups
- Release: staged rollouts, percent launches, holdbacks

**Tasks Layer**: The work managed in Kanban/Jira, but with an important shift - developers aren't just in an "Agile cage" focused on delivery. They participate in discovery and understand the why behind their work.

## How to Apply It

1. **Assess your biggest pain point**: Are goals unclear (misalignment)? Are debates endless (ideas)? Are you building without learning (steps)? Is the team disengaged (tasks)?

2. **Start with that layer**: You don't need to adopt everything at once. Pick the area causing most friction.

3. **Establish clear metrics**: Create your North Star Metric and Top Business KPI. Build metrics trees showing how sub-metrics connect to these top goals.

4. **Use outcome roadmaps, not release roadmaps**: Instead of "launch feature X by October," commit to "achieve outcome Y by October" - then let evidence guide how you get there.

5. **Create a GIST Board per team**: Display key results (max 4), current ideas with ICE scores, and next validation steps. Update actively; meet around it every two weeks.

6. **Involve the full team**: Let engineers participate in discovery. Let them help pick which ideas to test. Share evidence broadly so everyone understands what's working.

## When to Use It

- **Emerging product organizations**: Companies adopting modern practices (product teams, OKRs, Agile) but struggling to connect everything
- **Recovering evidence-guided companies**: Organizations that used to be evidence-guided but regressed due to management changes or cultural drift
- **Teams trapped in plan-and-execute mode**: Where a few people decide what to build and everyone else just delivers
- **High-uncertainty environments**: Startups and scale-ups where predicting what will work is difficult
