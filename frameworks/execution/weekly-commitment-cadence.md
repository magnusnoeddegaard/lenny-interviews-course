# Weekly Commitment Cadence

> "What am I doing this week to get closer to our goals? If you could answer that question, you could give up all the OKR stuff." - Christina Wodtke

## What It Is

The Weekly Commitment Cadence is a simple rhythm built around temporal landmarks that keeps teams focused on their goals. It uses Monday as a commitment point and Friday as a celebration point, creating bookends that prevent goals from being forgotten in the chaos of daily work.

This cadence is the "atomic unit" that makes goal-setting systems actually work. Without weekly touchpoints, quarterly goals become something you set and forget. The cadence ensures constant reconnection with what matters.

## How It Works

**Monday Commitments:**
- Look at your week
- Connect it to your quarterly OKRs
- Commit to 3 priorities (P1s) that move the ball forward
- Share commitments with your team, boss, or accountability group

**Friday Celebrations:**
- Gather as a team
- Share wins from the week
- Celebrate progress across the company
- End the week feeling like you're part of something meaningful

**Weekly Status Format:**
- Confidence level on key results
- What you did last week
- What you're doing next week
- Learning: What stopped you from completing what you intended?

**The Learning Engine:**
The "what stopped you" question is where the real learning happens. Patterns emerge: interruptions, dependencies, unclear priorities, capacity issues. This creates feedback for continuous improvement.

## How to Apply It

1. **Pick Monday as your commitment day** - Monday is a natural temporal landmark. Use it to rise above the noise and reconnect with your goals.

2. **Limit P1s to three** - You can have as many P2s and P3s as you want, but only three P1s. This forces prioritization.

3. **Share commitments widely** - Send status emails to the whole company, not just your manager. At Google, everyone's OKRs and updates are on the intranet.

4. **Track what stopped you** - The gap between "what I said I'd do" and "what I actually did" contains the most valuable learning.

5. **Keep status reviews brief** - Should take 10 minutes once established. Only discuss items that need conversation.

6. **Use the rhythm for personal goals too** - Christina has run her life on this cadence for 8-10 years, sending weekly updates to an accountability group.

## When to Use It

**Works for:**
- Teams implementing OKRs or any goal-setting system
- Individuals managing their own productivity
- Accountability groups or coaching relationships
- ADHD or easily-distracted people who need structure
- Anyone who finds themselves "tomorrow-ing" important work

**The key insight:** This works even without formal OKRs. One person in Christina's accountability group used a very loose approach—just thinking weekly about what she wanted—and transformed her career from PM to consultant to life coach.

## Why It Works

**Retrieval Practice:**
By reviewing goals every Monday, you practice retrieving them from memory. After a few weeks, they move into long-term memory. You don't have to look them up to make decisions—they're just there.

**Temporal Landmarks:**
Mondays and Fridays are built-in calendar breaks that give structure to the rhythm. You don't have to create artificial cadence—you piggyback on existing landmarks.

**The Tomorrow Problem:**
Important work always gets pushed to "tomorrow." Weekly commitments create a forcing function: you said you'd do it this week, and you have to report back.
