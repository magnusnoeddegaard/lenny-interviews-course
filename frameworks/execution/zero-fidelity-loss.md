# Zero Fidelity Loss

> "The thing about just having everyone in the same room every day is that a lot of people will complain that it's the most expensive use of everyone's time. But there's 0% fidelity loss in that. Everything, every day, is being audited front to back, and being discussed front to back." - Eric Simons

## What It Is

Zero Fidelity Loss is a communication philosophy for hypergrowth situations: accept the high cost of synchronous all-hands meetings in exchange for eliminating information degradation across the organization. When a company is growing at unprecedented rates and facing novel challenges constantly, the cost of miscommunication exceeds the cost of "expensive" meetings.

During Bolt's explosive growth (zero to $40M ARR in months), StackBlitz held daily company-wide meetings—not because it scaled, but because perfect information transfer was worth more than the time saved by async communication.

## How It Works

**The Information Fidelity Problem**:
- Every handoff between people loses information
- Every async message risks misinterpretation
- Every day without sync creates drift
- During hypergrowth, drift compounds faster than you can correct

**The Zero Fidelity Solution**:
- Gather the entire team synchronously
- Discuss everything front-to-back
- Everyone hears the same information at the same time
- Questions get answered immediately with full context

**StackBlitz Implementation**:
- Daily 8:00 AM Pacific calls
- At least one hour
- Pretty much the entire company (15-20 people)
- Everything discussed front-to-back

## How to Apply It

1. **Recognize when fidelity matters more than efficiency** - During periods of extreme change, rapid growth, or crisis, information quality matters more than time optimization

2. **Accept that this is expensive by design** - The meeting looks expensive because it is. The question is whether miscommunication is more expensive

3. **Make it truly comprehensive** - Half-measures don't achieve zero fidelity loss. You need everyone hearing everything

4. **Keep it temporary** - Eric explicitly says "I don't think we're going to do that forever." This is a phase-appropriate tactic, not a permanent state

5. **Combine with high context per head** - The daily sync works because the team is small and context-rich. With 200 people, this approach would break down

## When to Use It

- Hypergrowth periods where changes happen daily
- Crisis situations where coordination is critical
- New product launches with lots of unknowns
- Turnarounds where alignment is broken

## When to Stop

As Eric notes, the team is beginning to "splinter off into different syncs." The signs it's time to transition:
- Team size makes the meeting unwieldy
- Work becomes more defined and repeatable
- The rate of novel challenges decreases
- Subteams develop their own coherent contexts

## The Counterargument

The standard advice is that all-hands meetings are wasteful—"the most expensive use of everyone's time." Eric acknowledges this criticism and accepts it: yes, it's expensive. But during hypergrowth, the alternative—miscommunication, drift, redundant work, slow decision-making—is more expensive.
