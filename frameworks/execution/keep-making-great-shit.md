# Keep Making Great Shit

> "Just keep making great shit. Keep your costs in check. Charge appropriate prices for your work. Share as much as you can and let the chips fall where they may." - Jason Fried

## What It Is

Keep Making Great Shit is Jason Fried's distillation of business strategy into its essential elements. It rejects complex frameworks, multi-year plans, and sophisticated go-to-market strategies in favor of a few timeless principles executed consistently.

The approach works because it focuses on the fundamentals that actually matter. Most business strategy is performance—elaborate frameworks that make people feel strategic but don't change outcomes. This framework cuts through all of it: make good things, don't spend too much, price fairly, be generous, and see what happens.

The "let the chips fall where they may" part is crucial. It acknowledges that outcomes aren't fully controllable. You do your part well and accept that the market responds how it responds. This is freedom, not fatalism.

## How It Works

**The Five Elements**:

1. **Keep making great shit**: The product is the strategy. Focus on quality and craft in what you create.

2. **Keep your costs in check**: Don't spend money you don't need to spend. Efficiency creates options.

3. **Charge appropriate prices**: Not maximum prices, not minimum prices—fair prices for the value delivered.

4. **Share as much as you can**: Generosity builds reputation, trust, and organic reach without marketing spend.

5. **Let the chips fall where they may**: Accept that you don't control outcomes. Do your part well and release attachment to results.

**What's Notably Absent**:
- Growth targets
- Market analysis
- Competitive positioning
- OKRs and KPIs
- Multi-year roadmaps
- Exit strategies

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your activities**: How much time is spent on "strategy" versus actually making things? Shift toward making.

2. **Simplify your planning**: If your strategy can't fit on an index card, it's probably overcomplicated.

3. **Focus on craft**: What would make your product undeniably great? Do that instead of positioning exercises.

4. **Share generously**: Write, teach, open-source, give talks. Build reputation through generosity.

5. **Review costs ruthlessly**: Every dollar spent should clearly serve making, keeping costs down, or sharing.

6. **Release attachment to outcomes**: Do excellent work, then let go. The anxiety of controlling outcomes is wasted energy.

## When to Use It

- When strategy feels overcomplicated
- Starting a new business or product
- Resetting after a period of drift
- Countering pressure for elaborate planning
- Returning to fundamentals after complexity creep
