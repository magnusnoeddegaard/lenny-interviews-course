# One Shared Consciousness

> "I stopped pushing decision-making down. I pulled it in. I created one shared consciousness and I said, the top 30, 40 people in the company are going to have one continuous conversation." - Brian Chesky

## What It Is

One Shared Consciousness is an organizational alignment approach where senior leaders maintain continuous, coordinated awareness rather than operating as independent decision-makers in their domains. Instead of pushing decisions down to empowered leaders who then advocate for their areas, you pull decisions in and ensure everyone is part of one ongoing conversation.

The framework emerged from Chesky's experience at Airbnb, where the traditional "empower and delegate" approach led to fragmentation, politics, and slow execution. By creating shared consciousness, everyone rows the same direction without needing to build influence or navigate politics.

The key insight is that clarity beats empowerment. When everyone knows what the company is doing and why, individual autonomy becomes less important than collective alignment.

## How It Works

**Traditional Model (Pushed Down)**
- CEO sets high-level strategy
- Executives own their domains independently
- Decisions made at lowest appropriate level
- Success depends on individual leaders' judgment
- Coordination requires meetings, relationship-building, advocacy

**One Shared Consciousness Model (Pulled In)**
- Top 30-40 leaders in continuous conversation
- Single roadmap everyone can see and update
- CEO reviews all work on regular cadence
- Decisions made with shared context
- Coordination happens automatically through shared awareness

**Key Components:**

1. **One Rolling Roadmap**
   - Two-year roadmap updated monthly
   - Next month doesn't change; two years out changes
   - Everything must be on the roadmap (except some infrastructure)
   - No separate divisional roadmaps

2. **Regular Review Cadence**
   - CEO reviews all work at appropriate intervals
   - Weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or quarterly depending on project
   - Reviews surface blockers and bottlenecks
   - No need for influence—problems are visible

3. **Continuous Senior Conversation**
   - Top leaders maintain ongoing dialogue
   - Not periodic check-ins, but continuous awareness
   - "What are you working on?" is always known
   - Eliminates the need to "get people up to speed"

## How to Apply It

1. **Create the roadmap**
   - Document everything the company is doing in one place
   - Make it visible to all senior leaders
   - Update monthly with rolling two-year horizon

2. **Establish review cadence**
   - Schedule CEO reviews of all major projects
   - Score projects (green/yellow/red) for on-track status
   - Use reviews to identify and unblock problems

3. **Build the continuous conversation**
   - Top 30-40 people should know what each other are doing
   - Regular forums for sharing (not just status updates)
   - Emphasize context and dependencies, not just progress

4. **Stop requiring influence**
   - If something isn't happening, surface it in review
   - Don't require relationship-building to get resources
   - Make the path to resolution visible

5. **Eliminate parallel roadmaps**
   - No divisional roadmaps separate from company roadmap
   - If it's not on the roadmap, it's not happening
   - Two releases per year create natural forcing functions

## When to Use It

- When coordination costs are killing execution speed
- When politics and advocacy dominate how work gets done
- When leaders are surprised by problems that were visible to others
- When different teams are rowing in different directions
- When you want everyone to "row the same direction"
- During transformation or turnaround situations

## Trade-offs

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates coordination costs
- Removes need for political navigation
- Creates clarity and reduces surprises
- Enables faster decision-making with shared context

**Costs:**
- Requires significant leader time commitment
- CEO becomes potential bottleneck
- Less autonomy for individual leaders
- Works better with smaller senior teams

## The Paradox

Chesky discovered a counterintuitive result:

> "The more in the details I am, the more time I have on my hands. That's a paradox... If you decide to be in the details and get very hands-on, it might be a lot more work for about one to two years. But once we turned the corner, suddenly everyone started rowing the same direction. Suddenly I didn't have to be in meetings anymore."

The investment in shared consciousness pays off over time as the organization learns to operate coherently.
