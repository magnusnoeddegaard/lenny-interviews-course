# Metrics Trees

> "Once you have these two [North Star Metric and Top Business KPI], you can further break them down into what I call metrics trees... usually they overlap. So you might find in the middle some metrics that are super, super important because moving them actually moves the needle on everything else." - Itamar Gilad

## What It Is

Metrics Trees are hierarchical models that break down your top-level metrics (North Star Metric for value delivered, Top Business KPI for value captured) into their component parts. Think of it as a math formula that equals your North Star metric - if you don't have a clear sense of what that formula is, you're missing a crucial tool for prioritization, team design, and impact estimation.

The power of metrics trees comes from visualizing how sub-metrics connect to top-level outcomes, finding where the two trees overlap (high-leverage areas), and giving teams ownership of specific metrics within the tree.

## How It Works

**Building the North Star Tree**
Start with your North Star Metric and decompose it mathematically:

Example for a productivity suite where North Star = Documents Created per Month:
```
Documents Created
├── Active Users × Docs per User
│   ├── New Users
│   │   ├── Signups × Activation Rate
│   ├── Retained Users
│   │   ├── Previous Active × Retention Rate
│   ├── Docs per User
│       ├── Session Frequency × Docs per Session
```

**Building the Business KPI Tree**
Do the same for your revenue/business metric:
```
Revenue
├── Users × Revenue per User
│   ├── Paying Users × ARPU
│   ├── Conversion Rate × Retention Rate
│       ├── Free Trial → Paid
│       ├── Month-over-Month Retention
```

**Finding the Overlap**
Where these trees intersect, you find high-leverage metrics. In the example above:
- Activation Rate affects both documents created AND likelihood of conversion
- Retention Rate appears in both trees

These overlap metrics are your highest-priority targets.

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with your two top metrics**: Define your North Star Metric (value delivered) and Top Business KPI (value captured).

2. **Decompose mathematically**: Break each into its multiplicative components. Keep going until you reach metrics that are actionable by a single team.

3. **Visualize both trees**: Draw them out so the whole organization can see how pieces connect.

4. **Identify the overlap**: Which metrics appear in both trees? These are your highest-leverage opportunities.

5. **Assign ownership**: Give teams responsibility for specific sub-metrics. This creates mission and accountability without micromanaging the how.

6. **Use for impact estimation**: When evaluating an idea, trace its impact up the tree. If you improve activation rate by 10%, how much does that affect the North Star? The tree shows the math.

7. **Inform team topology**: If your goals have changed, you may need to reorganize teams to align with the new metrics tree. This isn't constant reorg - but periodic check-ins.

## When to Use It

- **Quarterly/annual planning**: Setting goals and allocating resources across the organization
- **Team structure decisions**: Determining what teams to have and what they own
- **Prioritization debates**: Quantifying the expected impact of competing ideas
- **Cross-team alignment**: When Team A wants Team B's help, the tree shows how their work connects to shared goals
- **New hire onboarding**: Helping people understand how their work contributes to company success
