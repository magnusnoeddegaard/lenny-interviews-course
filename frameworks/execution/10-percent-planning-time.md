# 10% Planning Time

> "The idea is that, roughly, you shouldn't be spending more than 10% of your time planning versus executing or building, which means that if you're working quarterly 10 weeks, you should spend one week planning. As we work in six-month increments, we try to spend two weeks planning and roughly successful." - Gustav Söderström

## What It Is

A simple but powerful rule of thumb for balancing planning and execution: never spend more than 10% of your cycle time on planning. This principle, which Gustav Söderström credits to Shishir Mehrotra (from his YouTube days), provides a clear guideline for avoiding both under-planning and the more common trap of over-planning.

The framework is deliberately prescriptive because it addresses a universal tendency: teams love planning because it feels productive without the risk of failure. The 10% cap forces teams to move from planning to doing.

## How It Works

**The Basic Math:**
| Execution Cycle | Max Planning Time |
|----------------|-------------------|
| 10 weeks (quarterly) | 1 week |
| 6 months | 2 weeks |
| 1 year | 5-6 weeks |
| 2 weeks (sprint) | 1 day |

**The Diagnostic:**
If you find yourself planning more than 10%, one of two things is true:
1. You're planning too much (most common)
2. Your execution period is too short for the complexity of what you're planning

**Why It Works:**
- Forces clarity: You can't spend weeks debating if you only have days
- Reduces planning theater: Long planning cycles often add complexity, not value
- Creates learning loops: You learn more by doing than by planning
- Matches reality: Plans change once execution reveals truth

## How to Apply It

1. **Calculate your ratio** - Track actual time spent in planning activities (roadmap sessions, sprint planning, strategy offsites) vs. execution time.

2. **Set hard boundaries** - If you're doing quarterly planning, book exactly 1 week and end it there. Don't extend.

3. **Match cycle to complexity** - If you genuinely need more planning, extend your execution cycle rather than your planning time.

4. **Include all planning** - Count everything: kickoffs, refinements, reviews that don't ship anything, strategy sessions.

5. **Timebox ruthlessly** - End planning when time runs out, even if you feel "not ready." You'll learn more by starting.

**Signs You're Over-Planning:**
- Planning extends into execution time
- The same topics get discussed multiple cycles
- Plans change dramatically once work begins
- Team feels they "finally understand" after execution starts

**Signs You're Under-Planning:**
- Constant re-work and pivots
- Teams blocked waiting for decisions
- Work gets discarded because it conflicts
- No shared understanding of goals

## When to Use It

- When setting up planning cadences for teams
- When planning sessions keep extending beyond schedule
- When deciding between thorough planning vs. starting execution
- When diagnosing why a team feels "always planning, never shipping"
