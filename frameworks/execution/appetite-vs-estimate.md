# Appetite vs Estimate

> "An estimate is like how long do we think it's going to take? And however long it takes is however long it takes. We instead have appetites. And our appetite for any individual feature is no more than six weeks. Essentially that's our budget we're willing to spend." - Jason Fried

## What It Is

Appetite vs Estimate is a fundamental shift in how to think about project planning. Instead of asking "How long will this take?" (an estimate), you ask "How much time are we willing to spend on this?" (an appetite).

This distinction sounds subtle but is radical in practice. Estimates are predictions about an uncertain future—and humans are notoriously bad at them. Appetites are decisions about resource allocation that you control. Estimates focus on the work; appetites focus on value.

The concept comes from the observation that work expands to fill the time available. Give a project 12 weeks, it'll take 12. Give it 24, it'll take 24. By setting a firm appetite upfront, you force the team to find the simplest, most effective version of the solution that fits within that constraint.

## How It Works

**Traditional Approach (Estimates)**:
1. Define what you want to build
2. Estimate how long it will take
3. Start building
4. When it takes longer than estimated, extend the deadline
5. Repeat until eventually done

**Appetite Approach**:
1. Consider the value of a potential feature
2. Decide how much time you're willing to invest (your appetite)
3. Shape the work to fit that constraint
4. Give the team that fixed time budget
5. Ship whatever fits, cut what doesn't

## How to Apply It

1. **Frame the question differently**: Before any project, ask "What's the maximum time we'd spend on this?" not "How long will it take?"

2. **Make appetites concrete**: State them clearly—"We have a two-week appetite for this" or "Our appetite is six weeks maximum."

3. **Shape work to fit appetites**: If your initial conception doesn't fit the appetite, simplify the scope until it does.

4. **Treat appetites as firm**: When the time runs out, the time runs out. Don't extend based on "we're almost there."

5. **Match appetite to value**: A minor improvement might get a one-week appetite. A major feature might get six weeks. Let the importance guide the investment.

6. **Use appetite language**: Replace "this will take..." with "we're willing to spend..." in planning discussions.

## When to Use It

- Any project planning or prioritization discussion
- When teams consistently miss estimates and extend deadlines
- When scope creep is a recurring problem
- When you want to force creative constraint-based thinking
- Product development where there's always more that could be done
