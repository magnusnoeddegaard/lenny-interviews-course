# One Season Commitment

> "I committed to record eight interviews and put eight interviews out in the world. That was it all I committed to myself. And I said, if that doesn't work, then I will be fine and say, 'Here is season one and there's just not a season two.' And I would be okay with it." - Chris Hutchins

## What It Is

One Season Commitment is an approach to starting creative projects that limits your initial commitment to a defined experiment. Instead of launching with the pressure of "this is my new thing forever," you commit to a specific, bounded output—typically 8-10 episodes, posts, or creations—and give yourself explicit permission to stop afterward without feeling like a failure.

This approach solves a common problem: people either never start (paralyzed by the perceived long-term commitment) or start with too much fanfare and then feel trapped when they discover they don't love the work.

The framework acknowledges that you can't know whether you'll enjoy creating something until you actually do it repeatedly, and that it's okay—even smart—to treat the beginning as an experiment.

## How It Works

**The Psychology:**

Most people either:
1. Never start because committing to "forever" feels overwhelming
2. Start with a public commitment, then feel trapped when they discover they don't enjoy it
3. Quit early and feel like failures

One Season Commitment reframes the start as a time-boxed experiment with a built-in, honorable exit.

**The Structure:**

- Commit to a specific number (8-10 is typical)
- Give yourself explicit permission to stop after that number
- Frame it publicly as "Season One" (leaving room for no Season Two)
- Evaluate at the end: Do I love this? Did it work? Do I want to continue?

**Chris Hutchins's Experience:**

He originally planned a parenting podcast and bought equipment, but after his daughter was born, the passion for the topic faded. Because he hadn't publicly committed, he could pivot without embarrassment to All the Hacks, where he committed to just eight episodes initially.

## How to Apply It

1. **Define your experiment** - Choose a realistic number that's long enough to give the project a fair test (8-10 for a podcast, 10-12 for a newsletter, etc.)

2. **Frame it as a season** - Both to yourself and publicly. "I'm doing a 10-episode series on X" sets expectations appropriately.

3. **Give yourself explicit permission** - Write down: "If I complete these 10 and don't want to continue, that's a success, not a failure."

4. **Actually evaluate** - At the end of your commitment, honestly assess:
   - Did I enjoy the process?
   - Would I do this for free indefinitely?
   - Is there evidence it's working?

5. **Make your decision** - If yes to the above, commit to the next season. If no, stop with pride in completing what you said you would.

**The 4 Million Podcast Problem:**

There are 4 million podcasts, but only ~150,000 have produced 10+ episodes and published in the last 10 days. Most people start and quit. One Season Commitment helps you:
- Not become a statistic (quitter after 3 episodes)
- Not trap yourself (committed to something you hate)
- Actually test whether this is for you

## When to Use It

- Starting a podcast, newsletter, YouTube channel, or any creative project
- Testing a new business idea alongside your day job
- Exploring whether to pursue a side project more seriously
- Helping others who are paralyzed by the commitment of "starting something"
- Pivoting from one topic/format to another without shame
