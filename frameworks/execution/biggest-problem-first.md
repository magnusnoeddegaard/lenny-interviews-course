# Biggest Problem First

> "Just top line? I think identifying what is the biggest bottleneck, what's the biggest problem and iterating fast on saying, 'Okay, this is the biggest problem, let's really, really solve that problem.' And then picking in the next one and not overthinking, not dreaming out the long roadmap." - Anton Osika

## What It Is

A radically simple prioritization framework: find the biggest problem, solve it completely, then find the next biggest problem. No complex scoring systems, no elaborate roadmaps, no quarterly planning theatrics.

This approach works especially well for fast-moving teams because:
1. **Reduces planning overhead** - No time wasted on elaborate prioritization frameworks
2. **Ensures impact** - If you're solving the biggest problem, you're by definition creating the most value
3. **Maintains flexibility** - You're always working on what matters most right now
4. **Creates focus** - The team isn't spread across many small things

The framework trades long-term predictability for maximum present-moment impact. It requires trust that solving today's biggest problem is the best use of resources.

## How It Works

**The Simple Algorithm:**
1. Look at all problems/bottlenecks
2. Identify the biggest one
3. Solve it completely
4. Repeat

**What "Biggest" Means:**
- The most significant bottleneck to growth
- The thing blocking everything else
- The problem causing the most user pain
- The issue holding back the most value

**What "Solve It" Means:**
- Don't partially address it and move on
- Really solve the problem, deeply
- Iterate until it's no longer the biggest problem
- Then—and only then—pick the next one

**Finding the Biggest Problem:**
- Talk to users constantly
- Read feedback and support tickets
- Watch feature request patterns
- Monitor where users get stuck
- Listen to the team's intuition

## How to Apply It

1. **Create a problem inventory** - List all known problems, bottlenecks, and user pain points. Use a simple jam board or document.

2. **Rank ruthlessly** - Force yourself to pick one as the biggest. Not top three. One.

3. **Commit fully** - Direct team energy toward solving this one problem until it's no longer the biggest.

4. **Stay engineering-led for product decisions** - The right solution might be technical, so keep engineers in the problem-solving loop.

5. **Maintain a short roadmap** - Know what's coming in the next month. Beyond that, stay flexible.

6. **Do weekly planning** - Regular cadence to reassess what the biggest problem is now, given what you've learned.

## When to Use It

- **Early-stage startups** - When moving fast matters more than predictability
- **Small teams** - When you can't afford to spread focus
- **Hypergrowth** - When the landscape changes too fast for long roadmaps
- **Product-market fit search** - When you're still learning what matters most
- **Crisis mode** - When you need to focus on what's essential

## When NOT to Use It

- **Large organizations** - Where coordination requires longer planning horizons
- **Enterprise sales** - Where customers need roadmap commitments
- **Platform teams** - Where infrastructure work has longer feedback loops
- **Regulated industries** - Where planned, documented work is required
