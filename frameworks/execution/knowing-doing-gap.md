# Knowing-Doing Gap

> "You cannot learn tennis by reading about tennis, or by watching a movie about Serena or Venus Williams. You have to actually get out on the court and do it." - Jeffrey Pfeffer

## What It Is

The Knowing-Doing Gap is a concept from Jeffrey Pfeffer's book of the same name that identifies a fundamental problem in learning and organizational change: the gap between what people know they should do and what they actually do.

The insight is simple but profound: knowledge alone doesn't create change. You can read all the books, attend all the classes, and intellectually understand best practices—but if you don't actively practice and apply what you learn, the knowledge will fade and your behavior won't change.

This explains why:
- Organizations implement training programs that don't improve performance
- People read self-help books but don't change their habits
- Teams know what good looks like but keep doing the same things
- Skills learned in courses disappear within weeks

## How It Works

### Why the Gap Exists

1. **Talk substitutes for action**: Discussing plans creates the illusion of progress
2. **Memory substitutes for thinking**: People rely on how things have always been done
3. **Fear prevents new things**: Trying new approaches risks failure and judgment
4. **Measurement obsession**: Tracking metrics becomes more important than improving them
5. **Internal competition**: Knowledge hoarding for competitive advantage

### Why Practice Matters

Pfeffer uses a language-learning analogy: "If you go to a French class and you learn French, and you never speak French, in about a relatively short period of time you'll forget everything you learn."

The same applies to any skill:
- Reading about networking won't make you a better networker
- Understanding power dynamics won't give you power
- Knowing how to give feedback won't improve your management

**Knowledge has a decay function**—it disappears without reinforcement through action.

## How to Apply It

### Individual Level

1. **For every concept learned, create an exercise**: Don't just absorb information—immediately apply it
2. **Get coaching**: Having someone hold you accountable forces action
3. **Start small**: Begin with actions 15% outside your comfort zone
4. **Schedule practice**: Block time specifically for applying new skills
5. **Create deadlines**: External commitments force follow-through

### Organizational Level

1. **Replace training with practicing**: Workshops should involve doing, not just learning
2. **Build feedback loops**: Create systems that surface whether knowledge is being applied
3. **Reward experimentation**: Make it safe to try new approaches and fail
4. **Focus on behavior change metrics**: Measure what people do, not what they know
5. **Kill "talk is action" culture**: Distinguish between discussing plans and executing them

### Pfeffer's Approach: "Doing Power"

In his Stanford class, Pfeffer requires students to complete action-based assignments:
- Identify 10 people who could advance your career, then actually meet them
- Record yourself giving a presentation and get feedback
- Create resources that give you leverage
- Practice showing up powerfully in low-stakes situations first

The final project is called "Doing Power"—students must take a real action to apply power principles, not just write a paper about them.

## When to Use It

- When training programs aren't producing results
- When you've read books/taken courses but nothing changed
- When designing learning experiences for others
- When trying to build new habits or skills
- When there's a gap between stated values and actual behavior
- When teams know what to do but keep falling back on old patterns

## Examples

**Closing the Gap:**
- Derek Kan's "Doing Power" project: Instead of writing about political influence, he actually worked to get appointed to Mitt Romney's economic policy team—and was offered the job
- Laura Esserman: Didn't just learn about power dynamics—she applied them to transform cancer research policy
- Omid Kordestani: Stopped doing his assigned work at Netscape and spent time networking instead—which led to being employee #11 at Google

**The Gap Persists When:**
- Someone reads every negotiation book but never practices negotiating
- A company sends managers to leadership training but nothing changes back at work
- Teams do retrospectives but implement none of the improvements
