# Speed of Decision-Making

> "Let's not schedule a meeting for next week or tomorrow or later today. We're in the middle of a meeting, we need to make a decision. Let's either make the decision or if we can't, let's Slack call in the person that we need in order to make that decision. And we'll be done with the decision today." - Jeremy Henrickson

## What It Is

Speed of Decision-Making is a cultural principle that prioritizes making decisions immediately rather than deferring them. The insight is that most decisions don't improve with more time—they just get delayed. And delayed decisions compound into organizational slowness.

This isn't about being reckless. Irreversible decisions deserve careful consideration. But most decisions are reversible, and for those, the cost of delay far exceeds the cost of occasionally being wrong.

The principle requires both cultural commitment (everyone values speed) and structural enablement (people have the context and authority to decide quickly).

## How It Works

The practice manifests in specific behaviors:

1. **Decide in the meeting**: If you're discussing something and a decision needs to be made, make it. Don't schedule another meeting.

2. **Bring in missing people immediately**: If you need someone's input, Slack call them now rather than waiting for availability.

3. **Respect deadlines absolutely**: When there's a timeline for decisions (like quarterly planning), that deadline doesn't move. If you miss it, you miss the cycle.

4. **Move on from slow deciders**: The organization doesn't wait for people who can't operate at tempo. This sounds harsh but it reinforces the cultural expectation.

**Supporting structures**:
- Deep domain expertise (people can answer questions without research)
- Clear ownership (one person can decide without committees)
- Leadership modeling (executives make decisions quickly, demonstrating the expectation)
- Explicit values (it's written down and reinforced)

## How to Apply It

### For Leaders

1. **Model the behavior** - Make decisions quickly in public. Let people see you decide and commit.

2. **Create clear deadlines** - Establish decision timelines and hold them absolutely. "That date passed. You don't get to retroactively make everybody react."

3. **Reduce approval layers** - Each layer of approval adds delay. Flatten where possible.

4. **Hire for speed** - Look for candidates who can think on their feet and make calls with incomplete information.

5. **Celebrate fast decisions** - Recognize when people made good calls quickly, not just when they made safe calls slowly.

### For Individual Contributors

1. **Come with recommendations** - Don't present problems; present problems with proposed solutions.

2. **Know your domain** - The faster you can reason about questions, the faster decisions can happen.

3. **Escalate immediately** - If you need something you can't provide yourself, escalate now, not tomorrow.

4. **Commit after decisions** - Once a decision is made, execute. Don't relitigate.

## When to Use It

- As a cultural value for high-velocity organizations
- When decision paralysis is slowing down execution
- In competitive markets where speed matters
- For most reversible decisions (which is most decisions)

**When to slow down**:
- Irreversible decisions (major architectural choices, large investments, personnel decisions)
- Decisions requiring external input that genuinely isn't available
- When you realize you were systematically wrong and need to recalibrate
