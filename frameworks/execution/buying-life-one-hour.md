# Buying Life One Hour at a Time

> "I was buying life one hour at a time... I'm trying to give them, 'Okay, I believe with this and I can wait an hour,' and then I can wait another hour because that team seems to be on it." - Ethan Evans

## What It Is

Buying Life One Hour at a Time is a crisis management technique for rebuilding trust when something has gone catastrophically wrong. Instead of trying to solve everything at once or going silent while you fix the problem, you communicate proactively in short intervals to keep stakeholders informed and prevent micromanagement.

Evans developed this approach during a high-stakes product launch failure where Jeff Bezos was directly emailing him demanding answers. Rather than promising a fix with an uncertain timeline, Evans committed to hourly updates with clear next steps—buying himself time to work on the problem while demonstrating ownership and progress.

The framework transforms a trust deficit into a manageable cadence of accountability.

## How It Works

**When Crisis Hits:**

1. **Own it immediately**
   - Don't deflect or make excuses
   - Say "Yes, it's not working. It's my fault. I will deal with it."
   - Take clear ownership without waiting for blame to be assigned

2. **Set a communication cadence**
   - Pick a short interval (one hour works well for acute crises)
   - Commit to updating at that exact interval regardless of progress

3. **Structure each update:**
   - Here's where we are right now (status)
   - Here's what we're going to do in the next hour (plan)
   - Here's when you'll hear from me again (next checkpoint)

4. **Hold the line**
   - Even if there's no new information, send the update
   - Even if the news is bad, send the update
   - The consistency builds trust even when the content doesn't

5. **Repeat until resolved**
   - Continue the cadence until the crisis is over
   - Gradually extend intervals as trust rebuilds (1 hour → 2 hours → 4 hours → daily)

## How to Apply It

**During the Crisis:**
1. As soon as you realize something has gone wrong, send an initial update acknowledging the problem
2. Establish your communication cadence immediately: "I will update you every hour at the top of the hour"
3. Set recurring reminders to ensure you never miss an update
4. For each update, write exactly three things: current status, next steps, next update time
5. Work the problem between updates, but stop to communicate regardless of progress
6. Accept that some updates will just be "still working on it, no new information"

**What This Accomplishes:**
- Prevents stakeholders from needing to check in (they know when they'll hear from you)
- Demonstrates you're actively working the problem
- Stops the spiral of increasingly angry messages asking for status
- Creates space to actually fix the issue without constant interruption
- Rebuilds trust incrementally with each kept commitment

**After the Crisis:**
- Continue communication for a period even after resolution
- Proactively share what you learned and what changes you're making
- Recognize that full trust rebuilding may take months, not days

## When to Use It

- When a major project or launch has failed publicly
- When senior leadership is demanding answers
- When trust has been broken by a missed commitment
- When you're at risk of being micromanaged during a critical fix
- When multiple stakeholders are anxiously awaiting resolution
- Anytime you're in a hole and need to demonstrate you're climbing out
