# Lightning Strike vs Peanut Butter

> "I'd rather matter for one week a year than be irrelevant for the rest of the year." — Christopher Lochhead

## What It Is

Lightning Strike vs Peanut Butter describes two fundamentally different approaches to marketing execution. "Peanut butter" is the traditional approach of spreading marketing budget evenly across the year—consistent campaigns, steady spend, keep-the-lights-on activities. "Lightning strike" concentrates a disproportionate amount of effort into intense, focused bursts designed to be undeniable to your target audience.

The peanut butter approach is based on 100-year-old marketing theory called "reach and frequency"—get your message in front of the most people, most often. This made sense when there were three TV networks. It fails today when people receive up to 60,000 marketing messages daily.

## How It Works

**The Peanut Butter Problem**: Traditional marketing takes the annual budget, divides it by quarters (with minor variations), and executes campaigns throughout the year. This approach:
- Is predicated on reach and frequency thinking
- Gets lost in the noise of 60,000 daily marketing messages
- Results in "keeping the lights on" but never breaking through
- Fails to create memorable impact

**The Lightning Strike Alternative**: Borrowed from Hollywood's movie launch model, lightning strikes:
- Concentrate effort into 1-2 major moments per year (B2B) or 2-3 (B2C)
- Target specific super consumers in places they already congregate
- Make you undeniable during that window
- Prioritize being memorable once over being forgettable repeatedly

**How Lightning Strikes Work**:
1. **Get very clear on your ICP** - Know exactly who your ideal customer is
2. **Find where they congregate** - Identify the digital communities, events, or channels where they already are
3. **Go deep, not wide** - If you're in their target audience during those days, you should be everywhere
4. **Create compounding word of mouth** - The strike should generate WOM that carries beyond the launch window

**Practical Allocation**:
- B2B: 1-2 lightning strikes per year (more than that blurs back into peanut butter)
- B2C: 2-3 lightning strikes per year
- Large companies: One per quarter maximum (hard to execute well)
- Keep-the-lights-on marketing continues alongside, but doesn't consume most resources

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your super consumers**
   - Who are the 8-10% of buyers responsible for most profits?
   - Who are the thought leaders others look to?
   - Where do these people spend time online?

2. **Design your lightning strike**
   - Pick 1-2 moments per year to concentrate effort
   - Model after Hollywood movie launches
   - Make these moments unmissable for your target audience

3. **Execute with overwhelming presence**
   - During the strike window, be everywhere your ICP looks
   - Coordinate product announcements, content, events, PR
   - Accept being invisible other times to be undeniable during the strike

4. **Optimize for word of mouth**
   - The goal isn't just awareness—it's WOM
   - Create things worth talking about
   - Put the right words in the right mouths

5. **Maintain (don't eliminate) keep-the-lights-on**
   - Basic marketing activities continue
   - But they're not where you expect breakthrough results
   - Lightning strikes are for breakthrough; peanut butter is for maintenance

## When to Use It

Lightning strikes are most valuable when:

- **Launching new products or categories** where you need to break through noise
- **You have limited marketing budget** and can't afford to be spread thin
- **Your category requires education** and you need focused attention
- **You're competing against larger players** who can outspend you on peanut butter
- **You want to drive word of mouth** rather than just impressions

Peanut butter approach may still be necessary for:
- Brand awareness maintenance in established markets
- Always-on demand capture activities (SEO, paid search)
- Customer nurture and retention programs
- Situations where consistent presence matters more than breakthrough
