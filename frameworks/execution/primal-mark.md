# Primal Mark

> "The primal mark is the first mark that you make on the canvas. And once you make that mark on the canvas, everything you do after that is in response to that mark. It sort of sets your baseline." - Bob Baxley

## What It Is

The primal mark is a concept borrowed from art: the first mark you make on a blank canvas fundamentally constrains everything that follows. Every subsequent decision becomes a response to that initial mark, narrowing the possibility space dramatically.

In software design, this translates to a counterintuitive recommendation: wait as long as possible before drawing a picture or creating a prototype. Once people see something that looks even remotely realistic, they anchor to it. The possibilities collapse from a vast space of potential directions down to iterations on that first artifact.

This principle is especially relevant in the age of AI prototyping tools. While these tools can rapidly produce impressive-looking mockups, they do so by training on existing solutions—your first-order thinking combined with patterns from existing products. The results feel productive but may prevent you from reaching your second, third, or fourth idea—where "stuff gets really interesting."

## How It Works

1. **Visual anchoring is powerful** - Humans are deeply uncomfortable with ambiguity. The moment they see something concrete, they latch onto it as "the thing" even if it shouldn't be.

2. **First ideas aren't best ideas** - The first solution that comes to mind is typically derivative. Better ideas emerge through continued conceptual exploration.

3. **High resolution accelerates anchoring** - The more polished an artifact looks, the more it seems like a finished decision rather than a starting point.

4. **AI tools exacerbate the problem** - Gen AI prototyping creates seductive high-fidelity outputs instantly, but they're based on patterns from existing solutions, not novel thinking.

5. **Fragile ideas need protection** - Like the plant in Wall-E, early ideas need nurturing. Exposing them to critique too early, in too-polished a form, can kill them.

## How to Apply It

1. **Stay in conversation longer** - Explore ideas verbally and on whiteboards before anyone opens a design tool.

2. **Use deliberately crude representations** - When you must visualize, use block frames or rough sketches that can't be mistaken for finished work.

3. **Seek second and third ideas** - When the first solution appears, don't stop. Say "that's interesting, let's table it—what else?" Push for alternatives before anchoring.

4. **Separate concept from expression** - An interactive idea needs to be expressed interactively eventually, but only after the concept is solid.

5. **Be intentional with AI tools** - Use AI prototyping for production (once you know what you want) rather than ideation (when you're still exploring).

6. **Challenge "demos before memos"** - While rapid prototyping has merits, recognize the trade-off: speed may come at the cost of conceptual depth.

## When to Use It

- At the very beginning of any design project
- When a team is stuck iterating on an uninspired solution
- When evaluating whether to adopt AI prototyping tools
- When stakeholders push for "just show us something"
- When you sense the team has anchored too early
