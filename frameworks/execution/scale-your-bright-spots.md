# Scale Your Bright Spots

> "Scale your bright spots. Find what's working and do more of that." - Dan and Chip Heath (cited by Graham Weaver)

## What It Is

Scale Your Bright Spots is a strategy principle from Dan and Chip Heath's book "Switch" that Graham Weaver calls "an unbelievable statement." The idea is simple but counterintuitive: instead of trying to fix everything that's broken, identify the few things that are working exceptionally well and expand them.

Graham has applied this principle over 23 years of building Alpine Investors, using it to survive early failures and eventually build one of the top-performing private equity firms. The approach works because it leverages existing success rather than hoping new initiatives will work.

## How It Works

### The Conventional Approach vs. Bright Spots

**Conventional**: Identify all problems, prioritize the worst ones, fix them systematically.

**Bright Spots**: Find what's already succeeding—even in small ways—and expand that.

### Graham's Application at Alpine

In Alpine's early years, results were poor:
- Lost money on their first fund
- Struggled during the recession
- Five of Graham's first eight investments lost money

But even in the dark times, "almost all the time, we always had at least a small glimmer of a bright spot."

Their process:
1. **Find the glimmer** - Even amid failure, identify what's working
2. **Scale it** - Do more of that specific thing
3. **Find more glimmers** - Look for the next bright spot
4. **Scale those** - Keep compounding what works

"Over time, all those bright spots became our business. That became what we did. That became our strategy. That became how we hired people. That became where we recruited from. All those bright spots just started to magnify until the entire business was pretty much a bright spot."

### Why It Works

1. **Proof of concept** - Bright spots have already proven they work in your context
2. **Lower risk** - Expanding success is safer than hoping new ideas work
3. **Faster iteration** - You're amplifying, not inventing
4. **Motivation** - You're building on wins, not just fixing problems

## How to Apply It

### Step 1: Identify Your Bright Spots

Look for positive deviance—places where you're succeeding against the odds:
- Which customers love you most? Why?
- Which products/features perform best?
- Which team members consistently exceed expectations?
- Which processes work smoothly?
- Which deals/projects generated the best returns?

### Step 2: Understand the Why

Don't just note the success—dissect it:
- What made this work when other things didn't?
- What conditions enabled this success?
- What can be replicated?

### Step 3: Scale Deliberately

Ask: How do we do more of exactly this?
- Can we find more customers like our best customers?
- Can we build more products like our best product?
- Can we hire more people like our best people?
- Can we replicate this process elsewhere?

### Step 4: Watch for New Bright Spots

As you scale existing bright spots, new ones will emerge:
- Stay alert to small successes
- Don't dismiss early wins as anomalies
- Treat each bright spot as a hypothesis to test at larger scale

## When to Use It

- **When struggling** - Even in failure, something is probably working
- **When prioritizing** - Instead of fixing problems, scale successes
- **When strategizing** - Let bright spots guide your direction
- **When hiring** - Identify traits of your best people and hire for those
- **When resource-constrained** - Focus on amplifying what already works

## The Time Factor

Graham emphasizes this approach requires patience: "But it took time, because we had to figure out where those were. And we had to do a lot of things wrong to figure out where the bright spots were."

Bright spots aren't always obvious immediately. You need enough data to see patterns.
