# Single-Threaded Focus

> "There are very few people who are able to execute extremely well in more than one thing, and it's especially true for individual contributors. What I mean by single threaded is there's only one goal, one thread, that they're waking up in the morning to focus on." - Geoff Charles

## What It Is

Single-Threaded Focus is Ramp's approach to team execution where each team has exactly one goal, one focus, and is actively shielded from all distractions. Unlike Amazon's "Single-Threaded Leader" which is about organizational ownership, Single-Threaded Focus is about protecting execution capacity by ruthlessly eliminating competing priorities.

The philosophy recognizes that individual contributors perform best when they have one clear thing to accomplish. Multitasking fragments attention and destroys the flow states that enable high-velocity execution.

When Ramp built their accounts payable product—a competitor to Bill.com—they assigned three engineers, one designer, and one PM with a single-threaded focus. The team hit it out of the park in three months, and the product now moves billions of dollars a year.

## How It Works

**What single-threaded means in practice:**
- One goal that the team wakes up thinking about
- No other requests, research, or production engineering that pulls attention
- Physical separation when possible—a dedicated room in the office
- No communication with the rest of the organization until traction is achieved

**The protective mechanisms:**
1. Remove all work outside the single goal
2. Shield the team from stakeholders, escalations, and requests
3. Create rotational production engineering roles to handle bugs and issues
4. Use product operators to handle documentation and enablement
5. "Don't even tell the rest of the company that you're doing these things until they find product market fit"

**How gravity creates resources:**
New products need to prove themselves before getting more people. Once a team finds traction, they develop "gravitational pull" that attracts additional resources. The key is protecting them until they achieve that initial success.

## How to Apply It

**1. Ruthlessly scope the goal**
Define exactly one thing the team is trying to accomplish. If you can't articulate it in one sentence, it's probably more than one goal.

**2. Remove competing work**
Identify everything else the team is currently doing:
- Research projects
- Production engineering rotations
- Process work
- Documentation
- Customer escalations

Transfer all of it elsewhere or eliminate it.

**3. Create physical and organizational separation**
"It almost goes as far as just saving a room in the office just for them and they are just in that room all day every day just working on that one thing."

**4. Shield the team from the organization**
Be the protective layer that absorbs organizational chaos. Don't forward the escalation emails. Don't loop them into status updates. Handle stakeholder questions yourself.

**5. Stay silent about the work**
Don't announce new initiatives broadly. Don't create cross-functional awareness until the team has found initial traction. Early visibility creates interruptions and expectations that destroy focus.

## When to Use It

**Good fit:**
- New product initiatives (zero-to-one)
- Big bets with tight timelines
- Small teams (3-5 people) with lofty goals
- Situations where focus is more valuable than coordination

**Not a fit:**
- Maintenance work that requires coordination across systems
- Customer success situations requiring cross-functional response
- Teams responsible for existing products with ongoing operational needs

## The Trade-off

Single-threaded focus requires pulling people from existing teams and reorganizing around new initiatives. This works best for zero-to-one projects. "It gets more challenging when you go from one to two rather than zero to one."

You're also creating information silos intentionally. The team won't know about related work happening elsewhere. This is a feature, not a bug—for focused execution, external awareness is a distraction.
