# Last 5% Matters Most

> "My mother used to describe to me, probably still does, that the last 5% is the 5% that really mattered." - Elizabeth Stone

## What It Is

The Last 5% framework is a mindset about excellence: the extra effort you put into something after it's "good enough" is what transforms it into something truly exceptional. It's not about perfectionism for its own sake—it's about recognizing that the difference between good work and world-class work usually lives in those final refinements.

This principle cuts both ways. Sometimes the last 5% of polish is essential—the difference between a mediocre presentation and a compelling one, or between a confusing document and a clear one. Other times, that final polish is a waste. The art is knowing when it matters.

Elizabeth Stone emphasizes that this isn't about working more hours. It's about caring deeply about excellence and holding yourself to a higher standard in the moments that count.

## How It Works

The framework distinguishes between two scenarios:

**When the last 5% matters:**
- Customer-facing experiences where quality directly impacts perception
- Communication that needs to land perfectly (high-stakes presentations, strategic memos)
- Work that will be referenced or reused repeatedly
- Situations where attention to detail signals respect for the audience

**When to skip the last 5%:**
- Internal documents meant to spark discussion, not document conclusions
- Early-stage explorations where the goal is learning, not polish
- Situations where speed dramatically outweighs refinement
- Work that will be iterated on quickly anyway

## How to Apply It

1. **Define the purpose first** - Before polishing, ask: "What's the outcome I want from this?" If it's a quarterly business review, the outcome is candid debate—not a beautiful document.

2. **Set expectations explicitly** - Tell your team when the last 5% matters and when it doesn't. Elizabeth gives feedback like: "I'd rather you spend time thinking about the conversation we want to have than polishing the deck."

3. **Model the behavior** - Hold yourself to high standards visibly. Be responsive, follow through on commitments, show up prepared. Excellence is contagious.

4. **Give feedback on the gap** - When work isn't meeting the bar, don't accept it. Be specific about what would make it excellent, and help close that gap.

5. **Recognize the difference between polish and substance** - The last 5% is about substance—clearer thinking, sharper communication, better outcomes. Not prettier formatting.

## When to Use It

- When reviewing work from your team and deciding whether to push for more
- When you're tempted to ship something "good enough"
- When scoping the effort level for a project
- When setting expectations with collaborators about quality standards
- When coaching someone who's not yet meeting the excellence bar
