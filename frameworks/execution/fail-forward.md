# Fail Forward

> "If you don't try, if you don't experiment, you will never innovate. And if you don't fail, you will never learn from your mistakes, you'll never learn from your experience, so you will not progress forward." - Inbal Shani

## What It Is

Fail Forward is a philosophy for organizational learning that reframes failure from something to be avoided into an essential component of progress and innovation. The framework argues that the fear of failure is often a greater obstacle to success than failure itself.

Based on John Maxwell's book of the same name (which Inbal recommends), this philosophy creates psychological safety for experimentation while maintaining accountability for learning from those experiments. The key distinction is between failure that teaches and failure that repeats—failing forward means extracting maximum learning from each setback and applying it to future attempts.

At GitHub, this philosophy is embedded in how the organization approaches innovation: "creating that bandwidth for the team to innovate and experiment and carving that time out, but also being okay that not every experiment is going to be successful."

## How It Works

The framework operates on several principles:

**1. Failure is Inevitable in Innovation**
Any meaningful innovation involves venturing into uncertain territory. If you're not experiencing failures, you're likely not pushing boundaries far enough.

**2. Learning Extraction is Non-Negotiable**
Failure without reflection is just failure. The "forward" part requires deliberately extracting insights, documenting what was learned, and applying those lessons.

**3. Experiment Size Matters**
Structure experiments to fail fast and cheap when possible. Small, contained failures are easier to learn from than large, catastrophic ones.

**4. Psychological Safety Enables Learning**
Teams must feel safe sharing failures openly. When failure is punished or hidden, the learning disappears and the same mistakes repeat.

**5. Progress Requires Risk**
Inbal's life motto captures this: "If you don't take risks, you cannot create a future." Comfort is a warning sign that you're not growing.

## How to Apply It

1. **Reframe failures as learnings** - When something doesn't work, immediately ask: "What did we learn?" rather than "Who's responsible?" This shifts the conversation from blame to growth.

2. **Create space for experimentation** - Allocate explicit time and resources for trying new things. Innovation doesn't happen in the margins of normal work.

3. **Set clear boundaries** - Define what kinds of failures are acceptable (reversible, contained experiments) versus unacceptable (customer data breaches, safety issues).

4. **Document and share learnings** - Create mechanisms for capturing what failed, why it failed, and what the team learned. Make these accessible to others.

5. **Celebrate thoughtful risk-taking** - Recognize and reward teams that take smart risks, regardless of outcome. This signals that experimentation is valued.

6. **Stretch yourself into discomfort** - "If you feel comfortable, it's not a good thing. You always need to feel uncomfortable to stretch yourself."

## When to Use It

This framework is particularly valuable when:

- Building a culture of innovation
- Launching new products or features with high uncertainty
- Coaching teams that are risk-averse
- Processing a significant failure or setback
- Designing experimentation programs

The framework connects to Inbal's personal leadership story—she describes her biggest "failure" as learning that driving change too fast without bringing people along doesn't work. She reframes this: "I'll call it the biggest learning because I'm not a believer in failure. I'm a believer in learnings."
