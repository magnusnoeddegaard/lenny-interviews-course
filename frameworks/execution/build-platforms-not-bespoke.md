# Build Platforms Not Bespoke

> "Why don't you figure out what the scalable solution is for this? We will build you a product. You won't need to come ask us every time to build something. And then you'll know the parameters in which you can negotiate." - Keith Yandell (quoting Rajat Shroff)

## What It Is

A principle for structuring BD-product collaboration: instead of building custom technical solutions for each partnership, invest upfront in a platform that can support many partnerships with minimal incremental engineering work.

Rajat Shroff, DoorDash's Head of Product, taught Keith this approach. The initial investment is higher, but the ROI compounds: subsequent partnerships require little or no product work, and BD can negotiate faster because they know what's possible.

## How It Works

### The Before State

Keith describes the old pattern:
1. BD negotiates a partnership (e.g., with Chase for DashPass)
2. BD asks product to build a bespoke integration
3. Product scopes work, adds to roadmap
4. Engineering builds custom solution
5. Repeat for next partnership

Each deal required product involvement. BD couldn't move faster than product capacity. Engineering hours were consumed by one-off integrations.

### The Platform Approach

Rajat's intervention:
1. **Identify the pattern**: Many DashPass partnerships have similar requirements
2. **Build the platform**: Create a generic partnership integration layer
3. **Define parameters**: BD knows what the platform can support
4. **Negotiate within parameters**: BD can close deals without asking product each time
5. **Scale**: Next partnership uses the same platform with minimal configuration

### The Benefits

**For BD:**
- Faster deal velocity (no waiting for product)
- Known negotiation parameters
- More deals closed per quarter

**For Product:**
- Higher return on engineering hours
- "We might spend more time on the first version of this, but very little effort for the next"
- Freed capacity for other priorities

**For the Partnership:**
- Faster time to launch
- More consistent integration quality
- Easier maintenance

## How to Apply It

1. **Wait for the pattern to emerge** - Don't platformize on the first deal. Wait until you see 2-3 similar partnership requests.

2. **Abstract the common requirements** - What do all these partnerships need? What's actually different between them?

3. **Invest in the platform upfront** - Accept higher initial cost for dramatically lower marginal cost.

4. **Define clear parameters** - BD needs to know what they can offer without product involvement. Document this clearly.

5. **Build an escape hatch** - Some partnerships will require custom work. Plan for exceptions without undermining the platform.

6. **Measure the ROI** - Track: deals closed, engineering hours per deal, time to launch.

### Platform Examples

- **Subscription partnerships**: Chase, Amex, other cards offering DashPass benefits
- **Enterprise integrations**: Employer benefit programs with similar requirements
- **Affiliate programs**: Partner referral tracking and rewards
- **White-label services**: Delivering for other brands with their branding

## When to Use It

- **You see repeated partnership patterns** - 3+ deals with similar technical requirements
- **BD is bottlenecked on product** - Deal velocity limited by engineering capacity
- **Partnership is a strategic channel** - Worth the investment because it's core to growth
- **Custom builds are low quality** - One-offs often accumulate technical debt

## When NOT to Use It

- **First partnership in a category** - You don't know the pattern yet
- **Highly unique deals** - Some partnerships are genuinely one-of-a-kind
- **Uncertain strategic value** - Don't invest in platforms for speculative categories
- **Resource constraints** - Platform requires upfront investment you may not have

## The BD-Product Partnership

This framework resolves a common tension:
- BD wants to move fast
- Product wants to protect engineering
- Both can be satisfied with platforms

When BD and product collaborate on platform design, both get what they need: BD gets velocity, product gets efficiency.
