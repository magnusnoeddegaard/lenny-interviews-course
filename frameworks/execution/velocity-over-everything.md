# Velocity Over Everything

> "Velocity is everything at Ramp. It's how we design our product development process. It's how we incentivize teams, it's who we want to hire, it's who we want to promote, and it's everything around how we make decisions and how we organize the organization." - Geoff Charles

## What It Is

Velocity Over Everything is Ramp's core operating philosophy that treats shipping speed as the primary organizational value. Unlike companies that merely talk about moving fast, Ramp operationalizes velocity into hiring, promotion, process design, team structure, and decision-making.

The philosophy emerged during the pandemic when Ramp started with a small team facing a huge market opportunity. The insight was that the path they chose mattered less than how fast they could execute on that path. Speed became the fundamental filter through which all other decisions flowed.

Ramp reached $100 million in annual revenue with fewer than 50 people in the R&D department—fewer than 40 engineers and 3 PMs. They built a competitor to Amex in three months. Six months later, they built a competitor to Expensify. Their accounts payable product was built by three engineers, one designer, and one PM in three months and now moves billions of dollars a year.

## How It Works

**Velocity creates positive feedback loops:**

1. **Talent attraction** - High-performing people want to join companies that actually ship. When candidates ask why they want to join Ramp, they often say, "You guys are actually building things and shipping things and I want to know what that feels like."

2. **De-risked decisions** - When execution is fast, the cost of making wrong decisions is low. You can quickly course-correct, which simplifies decision-making.

3. **Impact realization** - Teams that move fast can iterate to impact. "Teams that have high velocity are able to actually get to that impact over time by iterating."

**What velocity enables:**
- Any second spent planning is a second not spent doing
- Chaos is the expected operating mode—not a failure
- Quality emerges from velocity (not despite it) because you can fix things quickly

## How to Apply It

**1. Invest in engineering and design excellence**
PMs are "force multipliers"—useless without excellent engineers to multiply. The foundation of velocity is having an A-plus team. This means:
- Paying upmarket for talent
- Building your engineering and tech brand
- Hiring people who want empowerment

**2. Kill meetings and status updates**
"The biggest waste of time is meetings and status updates." Geoff has never scheduled a status meeting—all statuses are done async, in real-time systems. Meetings should only be for collaboration, ideation, and decision-making.

**3. Reduce focus to increase velocity**
When leadership says "I want velocity," push back with clear tradeoffs. "Here's what we're doing and here's what we're not doing and why and which one would you pick?" You execute faster on four things than eight.

**4. Create protective tissue around core teams**
Shield core teams from chaos:
- Rotational production engineering handles bugs and escalations
- Product operators handle documentation, release management, and customer requests
- Don't bother teams building new products—don't even tell the rest of the company until they find traction

**5. Accept chaos as the cost of velocity**
New joiners at Ramp get an explicit warning: "You signed an implicit contract joining Ramp. It's one where we prioritize velocity over almost everything else. What that means is it'll be somewhat chaotic. We'll ship things that don't work. We will change our products without necessarily fully enabling you."

## When to Use It

**Good fit:**
- Startups in large, clear markets with proven comparables
- Teams with A-plus engineering and design talent
- Organizations where trust and empowerment are already established
- Situations where learning-by-doing beats planning

**Not a fit:**
- Regulated industries requiring extensive compliance
- Companies without strong engineering talent (velocity without quality is chaos)
- Products where errors have catastrophic consequences

## Common Objections

**"Won't this cause burnout?"**
Geoff argues the opposite: "When I felt burnout, it was actually at the time where I had the lowest amount of velocity. It was when I felt like I was putting a lot of effort into things that weren't actually moving." Velocity reduces burnout by creating flow states and meaningful progress.

**"What about quality?"**
Research shows quality goes up as velocity increases. Because you can fix things quickly, quality improves. The control mechanisms matter: voice of customer processes, NPS/CSAT tracking, operational overhead metrics, and bugs directly assigned to on-call engineers.

**"What about planning?"**
"Be very accurate on the things that truly, truly matter"—large market moments, major launches. But "the rest actually doesn't matter. You don't need a lot of accuracy and confidence on when specifically certain features will be live."
