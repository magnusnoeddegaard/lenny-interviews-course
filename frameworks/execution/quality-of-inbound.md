# Quality of Inbound

> "We monitored success just within... I think a quarter was the time-bound space that we had it in on quality of inbound to the product team." - Christine Itwaru

## What It Is

A qualitative metric for measuring product-stakeholder alignment by tracking the sophistication of questions flowing to the product team. When product operations is working, questions shift from basic "teach me how to do this" requests to strategic "tell us what you do because our customers would benefit" inquiries.

This framework acknowledges that product ops effectiveness is difficult to quantify, but you can measure its impact by observing the nature of interactions between product and revenue teams.

## How It Works

**Low Quality Inbound** (indicates poor alignment):
- "How do I use this feature?"
- "Can you explain what this does?"
- "When is X being fixed?"
- "I don't understand the roadmap"
- Repeated questions about the same topics
- Requests for product team to directly engage customers on basic support

**High Quality Inbound** (indicates strong alignment):
- "Here's a pattern we're seeing across customers—should we explore this?"
- "This segment is asking for X—does that align with our direction?"
- "Our success team noticed Y could help with onboarding—have you considered it?"
- Strategic questions about market positioning
- Proactive sharing of customer insights with context

## How to Apply It

1. **Establish a baseline** - Survey both PMs and revenue teams at the start:
   - PMs: "How much time do you spend fielding questions from revenue team vs. talking to customers?"
   - Revenue teams: "How often do you need to ask product basic questions?"

2. **Track question themes** - Create a simple taxonomy of inbound requests. Categorize each as "educational/basic" or "strategic/collaborative" and track the ratio over time

3. **Set a time-bound goal** - Commit to improving quality of inbound within a quarter. This gives enough time to implement changes while maintaining urgency

4. **Address root causes** - Low quality inbound usually indicates:
   - Poor documentation or training
   - Lack of proactive communication
   - Missing feedback loops
   - Unclear ownership of customer success

5. **Celebrate improvement** - When revenue teams start bringing insights rather than questions, recognize the shift publicly

## When to Use It

Use this framework when:
- You need to justify investment in product ops
- PMs complain they're spending too much time on internal questions
- You're evaluating whether alignment initiatives are working
- Revenue and product teams feel disconnected
- You want a leading indicator for launch readiness
