# Six-Month Commitment Test

> "I told my wife as well that I'll do this for six months, and I'll see what happens. If there's traction, it's great. I might have found myself a new job, basically. If not, I'll just refund people." - Gergely Orosz

## What It Is

When starting something new and uncertain—a newsletter, a startup, a career pivot—commit fully for a defined period before evaluating. Six months is long enough to give the venture a fair shot, but short enough to limit downside risk if it doesn't work.

Gergely used this framework when deciding whether to pursue his newsletter full-time. Rather than waffling or half-committing, he gave himself six months of all-in effort, with a clear plan if it didn't work (refund subscribers).

## How It Works

**The Structure:**
1. **Set a time boundary** - Six months is typical; adjust based on context
2. **Define success criteria** - What would "traction" look like?
3. **Plan the exit** - What will you do if it doesn't work?
4. **Go all-in** - During the period, treat it like your only priority
5. **Evaluate honestly** - At the end, assess against your criteria

**Why Six Months:**
- Long enough to see if growth compounds
- Long enough to improve your craft through iteration
- Short enough to limit financial exposure
- Short enough to recover and try something else

## How to Apply It

1. **Choose your venture** - Newsletter, startup, product launch, career change
2. **Clear your calendar** - Eliminate competing commitments for the period
3. **Set specific criteria** - "X subscribers," "Y revenue," "Z user engagement"
4. **Communicate boundaries** - Tell family, friends, and stakeholders about the timeline
5. **Document your decision** - Write down what success looks like before you start

Gergely: "I told myself that I'll do this for six months, and I'll see what happens... I'm going to give it my all. It's basically like a startup."

## When to Use It

- Launching a side project you're considering making full-time
- Starting a new business with uncertain product-market fit
- Testing a career pivot before fully committing
- Any high-uncertainty venture where you need to know if it has legs

## Case Study: Steve Yegge's Podcast

Gergely cites Steve Yegge (legendary Google engineer) using the same approach:

> "He was pretty clear up front when he started... he said, 'What I'm doing is, I'm going to do this for six months and I'll see if it sticks, see if people care about it or people watch it.'"

Steve's podcast got a couple thousand subscribers but wasn't a rocket ship. After six months, he stopped and returned to industry work. The framework worked—he tested the idea, learned it wasn't for him, and moved on cleanly.

## The Mindset Shift

The six-month test transforms anxiety-inducing uncertainty into a structured experiment:

- **Without the framework**: "Should I keep going? Is this working? Am I wasting my time?"
- **With the framework**: "I have four more months. I'll evaluate then. Until then, I execute."
