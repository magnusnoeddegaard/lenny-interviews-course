# Abstraction Over Brute Force

> "I think just understand abstraction or system is a better curve than pecan curve, right? Linear. You can create progress through better abstractions. And that thing compounds faster, can catch up to all the things you build much quicker than you ever thought." - Ivan Zhao

## What It Is

Abstraction Over Brute Force is the principle that building better systems, tools, and abstractions creates compounding returns that outperform simply adding more people to solve problems. Humans tend to think linearly—if we need to do twice as much, we hire twice as many people. But the right abstraction can achieve exponential leverage.

Ivan Zhao draws on computing history to illustrate this. Smalltalk, one of the first programming systems and a major influence on Notion, was a tiny codebase—perhaps a hundred lines at its core. Yet from this small kernel, complex behavior emerged. Like mathematics, a few powerful primitives can compound into enormous capability.

This insight drove Notion's approach to staying small. Before adding headcount, they ask whether a better system or tool could solve the problem. They built Notion itself as a meta-tool—a Lego system for building other tools—and then used it internally to run everything. The result: a profitable company with high revenue per employee that competes against teams many times their size.

## How It Works

The framework operates on the recognition that different approaches have different growth curves:

1. **Linear scaling (brute force)**: Adding people adds capacity linearly, but also adds communication overhead, coordination costs, and organizational complexity. Returns diminish.

2. **Exponential scaling (abstraction)**: The right system or tool can unlock capability that compounds. Once you find the right abstraction, progress accelerates rather than decelerates.

3. **The reset opportunity**: When you discover a better abstraction, you can often catch up to months or years of linear work surprisingly quickly. Don't be afraid to reset if you've found a better foundation.

The kernel of things can be really small. A few powerful Lego bricks, like math axioms, can create complex emergent behavior. If you find the right primitives, the system works for you rather than against you.

## How to Apply It

1. **Default to systems before people** - When facing a capacity problem, first ask: "Can we build a tool or system to solve this?" Only hire when you've genuinely exhausted systematic solutions.

2. **Invest in your meta-tools** - Notion uses Notion to run Notion. What tools does your company build for itself? The leverage from internal tooling compounds over time.

3. **Hunt for the right abstraction** - When something feels harder than it should be, you may be working with the wrong primitives. Step back and ask if there's a simpler foundation that would make everything easier.

4. **Don't fear resets** - If you discover a better abstraction, the sunk cost of past work is less than you think. A superior foundation can catch up quickly and then accelerate past where you were.

5. **Think in compounding curves** - When evaluating solutions, ask: "Does this scale linearly or exponentially? Does this create leverage that compounds, or just add capacity?"

## When to Use It

- When the team argues for more headcount to solve capacity problems
- When you're evaluating whether to build vs. hire
- When facing a technical or product architecture decision
- When something feels harder than it should be
- When considering whether to reset and rebuild on a better foundation
