# Dual Track Agile

> "Having dual track agile going where you're doing discovery and delivery simultaneously and doing it in a way that's not waterfall... having this continuous cycle of essentially de-risking your assumption and getting to a point where you're able to do that with speed so that you can chart your way to new paths and to innovation by constantly figuring out where the errors are in your thinking." - Camille Hearst

## What It Is

Dual Track Agile is a product development approach where discovery (learning what to build) and delivery (building it) run in parallel rather than sequentially. Instead of the traditional waterfall approach where designers tinker for months before handing off to engineers, teams continuously validate assumptions while simultaneously shipping proven features.

The core principle is de-risking assumptions at speed. Rather than betting everything on a single plan, teams run a continuous cycle of testing ideas, learning from results, and adjusting course - all while maintaining a steady delivery cadence.

This approach originated from Marty Cagan's work at Silicon Valley Product Group and has been adopted by high-performing product teams to balance innovation with execution.

## How It Works

**Track 1: Discovery**
- Continuously testing assumptions about user needs, solutions, and viability
- Running experiments, prototypes, and user research
- Identifying and prioritizing risks to validate
- Learning what errors exist in current thinking

**Track 2: Delivery**
- Building and shipping features that have been de-risked through discovery
- Maintaining predictable delivery cadence
- Executing on validated ideas

**The Key Difference from Waterfall:**
- Not: "Designers go tinker for months, then lob it over the wall to coders and cross fingers"
- Instead: Continuous parallel tracks where discovery feeds delivery with validated opportunities

## How to Apply It

1. **Set up parallel workstreams** - Have discovery work running ahead of delivery work
2. **Identify your riskiest assumptions** - What beliefs about users, problems, or solutions could be wrong?
3. **Design rapid experiments** - Create fast, cheap ways to validate or invalidate assumptions
4. **Feed validated ideas to delivery** - Only commit engineering resources to de-risked opportunities
5. **Maintain delivery cadence** - Keep shipping while discovery continues
6. **Iterate continuously** - Use delivery learnings to inform new discovery questions

## When to Use It

- When building new products or features with significant uncertainty
- When you want to balance innovation (trying new things) with execution (shipping reliably)
- When waterfall approaches are causing slow cycles and missed assumptions
- When you need to chart paths to innovation through continuous learning
- When teams are large enough to support parallel workstreams
