# Node Graph Visualization

> "You could hover over and see this person's at the center of this node graph and all of these people that spread from this one person at the company. And that, I think, was the unlock to be like, 'Oh yeah, these internal champions, they're really the key to all of this.'" - Claire Butler

## What It Is

A data visualization approach that maps how products spread within organizations by tracking user-to-user invite and collaboration chains. Rather than looking at aggregate metrics like "users per company," node graphs show the actual pattern of how adoption spreads—who invited whom, which teams are connected, and who the key connectors are.

Figma built an internal tool where you could type in any organization's name and instantly see a visualization of:
- Every user in that organization
- Who invited whom (with generation tracking: gen 1, gen 2, etc.)
- Clusters representing teams
- Bridges between clusters showing cross-org spread
- The "patient zero" at the center of each cluster

This revealed that internal champions—the people at the center of node graphs with the most connections—were "really the key to all of this."

## How It Works

**What the Graphs Show:**

- **Clusters** - Groups of tightly connected users, usually representing teams
- **Centers** - Users at the heart of clusters who started adoption in that group
- **Bridges** - Connections between clusters where someone invited a colleague in a different team/org
- **Generations** - How many degrees of separation from the original inviter (gen 1, gen 2, gen 3)

**Key Insights:**

1. **Champion Identification** - The person at the center of a cluster is usually the internal champion. They're your most important user for enterprise expansion.

2. **Spread Patterns** - You can see if adoption is organic and viral (many bridges, multiple clusters) or stuck in a silo (one cluster, no bridges).

3. **Expansion Opportunities** - Isolated clusters suggest an organization could adopt more broadly if the right connections are made.

4. **Sales Prioritization** - Organizations with rich, multi-cluster graphs are warm leads for enterprise upsells.

## How to Apply It

1. **Track Invite Relationships**
   - Log who invites whom to collaborate
   - Track which user created which account (via referral or shared link)
   - Record collaboration patterns (who's in files together)

2. **Build the Visualization**
   - Create a queryable system where you can input an organization domain
   - Display users as nodes, invites/collaborations as edges
   - Highlight key metrics: cluster count, bridge count, champion identification

3. **Use It Operationally**
   - Sales: Identify champions to work with on enterprise deals
   - Success: Spot accounts with stalled adoption (single cluster, no spread)
   - Product: Understand which features drive cross-team collaboration
   - Marketing: Find users for case studies and speaking opportunities

4. **Build Champion Intelligence**
   - Who invited the most people?
   - Which clusters are disconnected from the rest?
   - Where are there opportunities to bridge clusters?

## When to Use It

**Most valuable for:**
- Collaborative products where users invite each other
- Bottom-up or product-led growth motions
- Enterprise sales where you need to identify champions
- Products with natural viral loops through sharing

**Prerequisites:**
- Enough organizational usage to create meaningful graphs
- User tracking that captures invite/collaboration relationships
- Data infrastructure to query and visualize at scale
