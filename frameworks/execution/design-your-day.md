# Design Your Day

> "There's a tactic in the book called Design Your Day that is really about kind of drawing out your day, and using your calendar as a canvas where you can design how you want to spend your time rather than using your calendar as a thing that is done to you." - John Zeratsky

## What It Is

Design Your Day is a reframe of how to use your calendar. Instead of viewing it as a record of meetings that others have scheduled for you, treat it as a design tool—a canvas where you actively shape how you want to spend your time.

Most people hate their calendars because calendars feel like things done to them. But the calendar is actually a powerful tool for protecting your priorities if you use it proactively rather than reactively.

The practice emerged from Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky's work running design sprints, where they controlled every aspect of how teams spent their time. They realized individuals could apply the same intentional design to their own days.

## How It Works

### The Shift in Mindset
- **Old view**: Calendar = where my meetings go
- **New view**: Calendar = how I design my time

### Practical Application

**1. Block Everything**
Put everything on your calendar, not just meetings:
- Exercise
- Breakfast/lunch
- Walking the dog
- Shower/getting ready
- Focus time for your highlight
- Even commuting or transitions

This lets you see your actual time reality and notice where assumptions don't match reality.

**2. Create Templates**
Develop a repeating template for your ideal week:
- Certain mornings for focus work
- Certain times for meetings
- Specific days for specific types of activities

John Zeratsky blocks Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday mornings for focus work. Tuesday and Friday mornings are for meetings. This isn't random—it's designed.

**3. Protect Highlight Time**
Block 60-90 minutes for your daily highlight at your peak energy time. When others see your calendar, they see you're busy. This changes the default from "that time is free" to "ask before booking."

**4. Use Reality to Iterate**
Compare what you planned vs. what happened:
- Did that block actually work?
- Did you need more or less time?
- Was that the right time of day?

Treat discrepancies with curiosity, not judgment. Adjust the template.

### Team Application
Teams can create shared calendar templates:
- Designated focus blocks that are team-wide
- Meeting windows when collaboration happens
- Content buckets filled with specific activity types

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with one week**: Block out everything you actually do on an ideal day
2. **Set it to repeat**: Make it a template that recurs weekly
3. **Protect your highlight time**: Block focus time at your best energy window
4. **Observe and adjust**: At week's end, compare plan vs. reality
5. **Iterate**: Move blocks, adjust durations, try different configurations

The goal isn't perfection—it's conscious design that you can improve over time.

## When to Use It

- When your calendar feels like it controls you
- When you're struggling to protect time for important work
- When joining a new team and setting expectations
- When starting a new role or project phase
- At the beginning of each quarter for a fresh design
