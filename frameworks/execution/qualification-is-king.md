# Qualification is King

> "It's qualification. If you spend your time on the wrong leads, that equates to a zero. Everyone that I know says they have a bottom of funnel problem. It's never a bottom of funnel problem. It's a top of funnel problem. I've actually never seen a bottom of funnel sales problem." - Jen Abel

## What It Is

Qualification is King is the principle that nearly every sales "problem" can be traced back to poor qualification at the top of the funnel. When deals stall, prospects go dark, or close rates are low, the instinct is to fix the bottom of the funnel—better demos, better proposals, better negotiation tactics. But the real issue is almost always that unqualified leads entered the pipeline in the first place.

Poor qualification is a symptom of:
- Reaching out to the wrong person
- Using the wrong message
- Solving the wrong problem
- Not being different enough

## How It Works

### Why Bottom-of-Funnel Problems Are Illusions

When founders say they have conversion problems, they usually mean:
- "Prospects seemed interested but went dark"
- "Deals keep stalling in procurement"
- "We can't get to a decision"

These look like closing problems, but they're actually:
- The prospect was never qualified to buy
- The problem wasn't urgent enough for them
- You were talking to someone without authority
- They were being polite, not interested

### The Qualification Cascade

Bad qualification creates a cascade of wasted effort:

```
Wrong person → Nice conversations → No authority → No decision
Wrong problem → Interest → No urgency → Deal stalls
Wrong message → Surface engagement → No alignment → Goes dark
Not different enough → "Better" framing → Stays with incumbent
```

Each stage looks like a "funnel problem" but originates from qualification.

### Win Rate vs. Conversion Rate

This framework connects to prioritizing **win rate** over **conversion rate**:

- **Conversion rate**: How many people respond to outreach
- **Win rate**: Of those who enter the funnel, how many close

If win rate is high (30-40%), you can tolerate lower conversion rates because qualified prospects close.

If win rate is low, high conversion rates just fill your pipeline with noise.

## How to Apply It

1. **Diagnose "stuck" deals backward**
   - For every stalled deal, ask: "Were they ever truly qualified?"
   - Look for signals that qualification was weak from the start

2. **Define true qualification criteria**
   - Do they have the problem you solve?
   - Is it a priority for them?
   - Do they have budget/authority?
   - Are they measuring/managing this problem today?

3. **Qualify harder, not softer**
   - It's better to have 10 highly qualified leads than 100 maybes
   - Disqualify quickly and move on
   - Time on wrong leads = zero return

4. **Listen for qualification signals on first calls**
   - "We're measuring this problem" → Good sign
   - "We hired someone to manage this" → Even better
   - "It's not really a priority" → Disqualify

5. **Don't confuse politeness with qualification**
   - "This looks interesting" ≠ qualified
   - "Let me think about it" ≠ qualified
   - "I'll introduce you to my colleague" = maybe qualified

## The Questions That Reveal Qualification

On first calls, these questions expose qualification:

1. **"Are you measuring or managing this problem today?"**
   - No = likely not qualified
   - Yes = explore further

2. **"How have you tried to solve this?"**
   - Haven't tried = low urgency
   - Hired someone = high urgency
   - Tried multiple approaches = very high urgency

3. **"What's the implication if this doesn't get solved?"**
   - Vague answer = low priority
   - Specific business impact = qualified

4. **"Who else would need to be involved in this decision?"**
   - "Just me" = either great or they lack authority
   - Names other stakeholders = good sign

## When to Use It

- When close rates are declining
- When deals keep stalling
- When prospects go dark after good conversations
- When you're wondering if it's a "sales problem" or "product problem"
- During pipeline reviews and forecasting

## The Uncomfortable Truth

When qualification is poor, it's usually because:
- The founder doesn't want to hear that their market is limited
- They're accepting any interest as validation
- They're avoiding the hard question: "Is this really a problem people will pay to solve?"

Bad qualification can also mask product-market fit issues. When everyone seems interested but no one buys, the problem often isn't sales—it's that the problem isn't painful enough or the solution isn't different enough.
