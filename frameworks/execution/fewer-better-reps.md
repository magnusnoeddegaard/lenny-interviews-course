# Fewer Better Reps

> "I'd much rather have two reps, each closing a million than 20 reps struggling to close 100k each." - Jason Lemkin

## What It Is

Fewer Better Reps is the principle that quality beats quantity in early-stage sales hiring. While "capacity planning" at scale requires specific headcount, in the early days you should concentrate leads on your best closers rather than spreading them thin across a large, mediocre team.

The math looks the same ($2M closed either way), but the organizational dynamics are completely different.

## Why This Matters

**20 Struggling Reps Create:**
- Cultural problems (everyone is frustrated)
- No domain knowledge (too much turnover)
- Fighting over leads (not enough to go around)
- Misery (missing quota is demoralizing)
- No learnings (nobody's winning enough to learn)

**2 Excellent Reps Create:**
- Strong culture (winning is energizing)
- Deep domain knowledge (they learn over time)
- Clear playbook (what works becomes obvious)
- High morale (hitting quota feels good)
- Valuable learnings (concentrated success = pattern recognition)

## How It Works

**The Concentration Principle:**

In early stages, leads are precious. Every meeting matters. You can't afford to waste them on reps who can't convert.

Instead of distributing equally:
- Identify your best closers
- Give them more leads, not fewer
- Let them get really good
- Learn from what works
- Then carefully add more reps

**The Compounding Effect:**

Good reps get better. They:
- Learn the objections
- Perfect the demo
- Build reference customers
- Develop product expertise
- Create a repeatable playbook

Bad reps stay bad—or leave. Either way, you've wasted months and leads.

## How to Apply It

### In Early Stages (0-5 reps)

1. **Start with two** - Never just one (need the A/B test)
2. **Give them time** - 3 months minimum to see patterns
3. **Concentrate leads** - Don't spread thin
4. **Watch who wins** - The gap will become clear

### When Scaling

5. **Feed your stars first** - Best closers get priority
6. **Bring up new reps slowly** - Don't flood them with leads before they're ready
7. **Maintain quality bar** - Never add reps just for headcount
8. **Accept slower growth** - Better than wasted leads

### When to Add Headcount

9. **When best reps are at capacity** - They literally can't handle more
10. **When playbook is clear** - You know what to teach new hires
11. **When you find someone exceptional** - Don't wait if the right person appears
12. **When data supports it** - Conversion rates justify more reps

## The Capacity Planning Trap

At scale, capacity planning matters:
- "We need 10 reps to hit our number"
- "Each rep can close $400K"
- "Therefore, we need to hire 10 reps"

This logic fails early because:
- You don't know what a "good" rep can close
- Your playbook isn't established
- Your leads are too precious to waste
- Bad reps create negative returns

Later, yes—you need math-based capacity planning. Early? Focus on fewer, better.

## The Pipedrive Story

The first sales rep at Pipedrive (when the company was ~$2M) made more than any founder within three months. The founders were frustrated:

> "I'm like, 'Guys, I know we have different backgrounds and cultures, but this is what you want.'"

He concentrated leads. He closed. The company learned. That's the goal.

## Warning Signs You've Hired Too Many

- Reps fighting over inbound leads
- Everyone missing quota
- High turnover in sales
- "Not enough leads" is the constant complaint
- No one developing deep product expertise
