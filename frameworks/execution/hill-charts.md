# Hill Charts

> "A project's more like a hill. It's not like a linear line. If you're on the left side of the hill, it means you're still pushing this thing up the hill. You're still trying to figure out how to do this. But once work gets to the top, it's downhill from there. It's just pure execution and we know how to nail it." - Jason Fried

## What It Is

Hill Charts are a visual method for tracking project progress that reveals the actual risk in work—not just how much time has been spent or how many tasks are done.

Traditional progress tracking treats projects as linear: you're 25% done, then 50%, then 75%, then shipped. But this misses a crucial reality—a project where you've spent 75% of the time but are still "figuring things out" is at far greater risk than one where you've spent 25% of the time but have clarity on exactly what to build.

Hill Charts capture this by visualizing work as climbing a hill. The left side (uphill) represents the "figuring out" phase—uncertainty, unknowns, problem-solving. The right side (downhill) represents the "execution" phase—you know exactly what to do, you just need to do it.

## How It Works

**The Uphill Phase (Left Side)**:
- You're still figuring things out
- There are unknowns and open questions
- The approach isn't yet clear
- This is where scope often expands unexpectedly
- High risk phase

**The Peak**:
- The moment of clarity
- You now know how to solve the problem
- No more major unknowns remain
- Scope is locked

**The Downhill Phase (Right Side)**:
- Pure execution mode
- You know exactly what to do
- It's just about putting in the work
- Low risk phase
- Highly predictable

**Reading the Chart**:
- Work on the left side = still figuring out (risky)
- Work on the right side = executing known work (safe)
- Work stuck at the peak = often means hidden unknowns

## How to Apply It

1. **Plot work visually**: Create a hill representation for each major piece of work in progress.

2. **Move markers based on clarity, not time**: A piece moves up the hill as unknowns get resolved, not as hours accumulate.

3. **Pay attention to stuck items**: Work that hasn't moved in a while, especially on the left side, signals problems.

4. **Make scope decisions based on position**: At deadline time, look at where work sits. Uphill work might need to be cut. Downhill work can be completed.

5. **Use it in check-ins**: Instead of "how's it going?" ask "where is this on the hill?"

6. **Be honest about position**: It's tempting to move work downhill prematurely. Resist—the chart is only useful if it reflects reality.

## When to Use It

- Sprint or cycle progress reviews
- When traditional percentage-based progress tracking feels misleading
- Risk assessment for ongoing projects
- Deciding what to cut when time runs out
- Identifying which projects need more attention or support
