# Book the Next Call

> "Get the second call booked on the first call. Pull up calendars. Look at calendars. Who else should be invited? It's just a natural evolution to ending the call... And if they say, 'Ah, I'll email you,' that's also kind of a leading indicator." - Jen Abel

## What It Is

Book the Next Call is a simple but critical sales discipline: never end a conversation without scheduling the next meeting while you're still on the call. Don't accept "I'll email you" or "Let me check my calendar and get back to you."

This practice serves two purposes: it maintains deal momentum, and it's a qualification test. Prospects who won't commit to a next step on the call are often not truly interested.

## How It Works

### The Momentum Principle

When a call ends without a scheduled next step:
- You enter email limbo
- Urgency dissipates
- Other priorities take over
- You become one of dozens of follow-ups they owe

When the next call is booked:
- The deal has structure
- Both parties have commitment
- The prospect has cleared time = investment
- You can prepare knowing exactly what's next

### The Qualification Test

"I'll email you" is polite rejection in disguise 9 times out of 10:

> "Nine times out of ten, 'I'll email you' is usually 'I don't have the heart to tell you I'm not interested.'"

If they're truly interested, they will:
- Pull up their calendar
- Suggest times that work
- Ask who else should be invited
- Want to move forward

### The Calendar as Truth Serum

People protect their calendars. Getting on someone's calendar is commitment. If they won't commit 30 minutes in the next week or two, what does that tell you?

## How to Apply It

1. **End every call with scheduling**
   - "Let's pull up calendars and find time for our next conversation"
   - "I'd love to continue this—what does next week look like for you?"
   - Make it a natural part of the call flow, not an awkward ask

2. **Add structure to the ask**
   - "For our next call, I'd like to go deeper on X. Who else should join?"
   - "I'll prepare a demo of the specific area you mentioned. When works for you?"
   - Give them a reason for the next call

3. **Expand the invite list**
   - "Who else on your team would benefit from this conversation?"
   - "You mentioned your boss cares about this—should we include them?"
   - Getting more stakeholders = more qualification

4. **When they deflect, read the signal**
   - "I'll email you" = probably not interested
   - "I need to check with my team first" = might be genuine, suggest a specific follow-up
   - "Let me think about it" = low interest

5. **Keep calls tight**
   - Don't schedule the next call for two weeks out
   - One week maximum if possible
   - Elongated timelines = elongated sales cycles

## What It Looks Like

**End of Call Script:**
```
"This was really helpful. I'd love to continue the conversation
and show you [specific thing relevant to what they mentioned].
Let's find a time—what does next week look like for you?"

[Pull up calendar]

"And should we include [person they mentioned] for that call?"
```

## When to Use It

- End of every first call
- End of every subsequent call
- Anytime you need to maintain momentum
- When you suspect interest might be lukewarm (test it)

## The "I'll Email You" Response

If they say "I'll email you," you have two options:

**Option 1: Soft push**
- "I totally understand—just to make it easy, can we tentatively block something? We can always move it."

**Option 2: Accept the signal**
- "Of course, I'll follow up via email."
- But internally: mark as low priority
- Their follow-through (or lack thereof) will confirm

## Why This Works

1. **Commitment psychology**: Scheduling = commitment
2. **Momentum**: Deals lose energy without next steps
3. **Qualification**: Interest is revealed through calendar willingness
4. **Time efficiency**: Don't chase people who won't commit
5. **Professionalism**: It's what real business people do
