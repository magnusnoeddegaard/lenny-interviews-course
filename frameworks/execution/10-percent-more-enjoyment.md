# 10 Percent More Enjoyment

> "If you say, 'I'm going to figure out how to enjoy what I do 10% more' and you succeed, you are 10% more efficient. Not only that, usually, the quality is going to get a lot better too." - Joe Hudson

## What It Is

The 10 Percent More Enjoyment framework is a simple question that transforms productivity: "How do I enjoy this 10% more right now?" It redefines efficiency not as getting things done quickly, but as ending activities with more energy than you started—the state where you can't wait to do it again tomorrow.

Joe Hudson distinguishes this from the common approach of pursuing enjoyment by changing what you do (fewer unpleasant tasks, more vacations). That approach doesn't work—billionaires who arrange their lives to maximize pleasure still often feel unhappy. The key is learning to enjoy what's in front of you, which paradoxically leads to doing more things you enjoy naturally.

The framework also challenges the idea that enjoyment is about trying harder. Usually it's about letting go of trying—taking a deeper breath, settling into your body, relaxing. The phrasing matters: "How do you enjoy it 10% more?" invites relaxation; "What can I change to enjoy this?" invites trying.

## How It Works

**Why enjoyment is a productivity tool:**
- True efficiency = minimum energy to achieve an outcome
- Getting things done quickly but feeling exhausted isn't efficient
- Ending with energy means you'll sustain the work longer
- Enjoyment correlates with quality, staying power, and ability to do it again

**The internal shift:**
- You can enjoy taking out the trash or hate taking out the trash—that's a choice
- Nothing in your external circumstances needs to change
- When asked the question, people typically: breathe deeper, settle into their body, relax, get more comfortable
- The shift is internal, immediate, and available anytime

**Why "trying" backfires:**
- Trying is usually not more enjoyment
- Letting go of trying creates more enjoyment
- The precise phrasing of the question matters

## How to Apply It

1. **Notice your current state** - During any activity, pause and check in

2. **Ask the question** - "How do I enjoy this 10% more right now?"
   - Not: "What can I change to make this better?"
   - Not: "How should I feel about this?"
   - Exactly: "How do I enjoy this 10% more right now?"

3. **Let the response arise** - Don't force it. Notice what naturally shifts: breath, posture, attention, presence

4. **Repeat throughout the day** - Use this in meetings, during focused work, even during tasks you think you hate

5. **Track the ripple effects** - Notice how energy levels, quality, and desire to continue change over time

**Order of operations:**
- First: Learn to enjoy what you're doing
- Then: You'll naturally start doing more things you enjoy
- NOT: First do only things you enjoy, then you'll learn to enjoy things

## When to Use It

- In any meeting (even boring ones)
- During tasks you've been dreading
- When you notice energy flagging
- When quality of work seems low
- As a daily practice throughout all activities
- When you catch yourself thinking "I have to do X so I can eventually do Y"
