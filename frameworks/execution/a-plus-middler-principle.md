# A+ Middler Principle

> "Almost all founders are A+ middlers, A+ middlers, A+ middlers." - Jason Lemkin

## What It Is

The A+ Middler Principle is a reassuring truth for founders who think they're "bad at sales": almost every founder is naturally excellent at the middle part of sales conversations. You might not know how to find leads or close deals, but once someone is in front of you, you can talk about your product and industry better than anyone.

This is your superpower. Embrace it.

## How It Works

**Sales Has Three Parts:**

1. **Opening** (Finding leads, cold outreach, getting meetings)
2. **Middle** (Product discussions, demos, answering questions, solving problems)
3. **Closing** (Asking for the business, negotiating, getting signatures)

**Founders are natural A+ Middlers because:**
- They know the product deeply
- They understand customer problems intimately
- They can answer questions sales reps can't
- They built the solution and know why it works
- Prospects love talking to the CEO

**Where founders typically struggle:**
- Outbound prospecting (opening)
- Cold emails and calls (opening)
- Asking for money (closing)
- Pushing for next steps (closing)

## The Middler Advantage Over Sales Reps

Sales reps need help in the middle. Most can only handle the first 10 basic questions about your product. After that:
- They need sales engineers
- They need product people
- They need to escalate to leadership

Founders? They can run circles around 98% of competitor sales reps in the middle. You can answer questions about:
- How the database works
- How to eliminate hallucinations
- Why your approach is different
- Edge cases and integrations
- The roadmap and vision

This is why customers love talking to founders. They get depth they can't get anywhere else.

## How to Apply It

### Embrace the Middle

1. **Stop apologizing** - You're not "bad at sales"—you're great at the hardest part
2. **Get in more conversations** - Every meeting is a chance to showcase your strength
3. **Let people find you** - While you figure out outbound, be ready for inbound

### Learn the Ends (Minimally)

4. **Work up courage for closing** - You don't need to be pushy. Just ask: "What would it take to get going?"
5. **Ask for next steps** - "Who else should see this? Can we schedule a follow-up?"
6. **Document what works** - Your middle conversation becomes the playbook

### Hire for What You Lack

7. **SDRs handle opening** - They find leads, you close them
8. **Sales reps handle closing** - They ask for money, you provide depth
9. **Stay in the middle** - Even with a team, join calls where your expertise wins deals

## The Closing Bridge

Founders don't need to become sharks. The bridge from middle to close can be gentle:

- "What would it take to get going next week?"
- "How can we get this started for you?"
- "I'd love to help you solve this—what are the next steps on your side?"

That's it. You're not selling a used car. You're helping someone solve a problem. Ask for next steps and work up to asking for money.

## Why This Matters for Hiring

Understanding this principle changes how you hire:

- Don't hire sales reps expecting them to know your product deeply
- Expect to be in calls during the middle phase for your biggest deals
- Hire people good at opening and closing—you provide the middle
- Your first reps need to be "product savants" because you can't scale yourself

## Warning: This Changes at Scale

As companies grow, founders can't be in every deal. This is when you need:
- Sales engineers who can go deep
- Product people on sales calls
- VP of Product who can close enterprise deals
- Documentation and training that captures middle expertise

Until then, your middler advantage is your secret weapon.
