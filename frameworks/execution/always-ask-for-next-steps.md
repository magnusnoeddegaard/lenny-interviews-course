# Always Ask for Next Steps

> "The number one thing they can do... learn to ask for what's the next step. Even if you're not comfortable asking for money, learn to ask for what's the next step." - Jason Lemkin

## What It Is

Always Ask for Next Steps is the single most important sales behavior for founders who think they're "bad at sales." You don't need to be pushy or ask for money—but you must never end a meeting without an explicit agreement on what happens next.

The best salespeople march deals step by step by step. Mediocre salespeople (and most founders) end the Zoom and wait for their inbox. The next step rarely comes on its own.

## Why This Matters

**What happens without explicit next steps:**
- Momentum dies after the call
- Prospects get busy with other priorities
- You wait hoping they'll reach out
- Deals stall indefinitely
- You have no idea where you stand

**What happens with explicit next steps:**
- Energy from the call carries forward
- You have a reason to follow up
- Prospects expect to hear from you
- Deals move through the pipeline
- You know where you stand

## How It Works

**The Progression:**
Good salespeople don't jump from demo to close. They move through steps:

1. Demo → Schedule follow-up call
2. Follow-up → Introduce to another stakeholder
3. Stakeholder meeting → Start a pilot
4. Pilot → Discuss pricing
5. Pricing → Get to signature

Each step earns the right to the next step.

## How to Apply It

### End Every Meeting with a Next Step

1. **Before the call ends** - "What should our next step be?"
2. **Be specific** - Get a date and time, not "sometime next week"
3. **Get it on the calendar** - Send the invite before you hang up
4. **Have a fallback** - If they're unsure, suggest: "Can I follow up in a week?"

### Easy Next Steps That Aren't "Buy Now"

5. **"Who else should see this?"** - Expand within the organization
6. **"Can I do a demo for your team?"** - Not threatening, adds value
7. **"Should we schedule a technical deep-dive?"** - For technical products
8. **"Can I send you a pilot proposal?"** - Moves toward action
9. **"When should I follow up?"** - If nothing else, set a check-in

### For Founders Who Hate Selling

You don't need to ask for money. You need to ask:

- "What would it take to get going?"
- "How can we move this forward?"
- "What's the best next step for you?"

These questions feel like helping, not selling—because they are.

## The Step-by-Step Journey

Deals close through cumulative next steps:

> "The best salespeople march deals step by step by step by step. They've done the demos, they've done the pilot if they need to, they've helped them get going, they've helped them see the value."

By the time you ask for the signature, you've earned it through all the previous steps.

## Common Mistakes

- Ending with "Let me know if you have questions"
- Saying "I'll follow up next week" without scheduling it
- Waiting for them to reach out
- Being vague: "We should talk again sometime"
- Assuming they'll do what they said without confirmation

## Log It in Your CRM

Every next step should be:
- Written down immediately
- Logged in your CRM
- With a specific date
- And clear action items

If it's not in the system, it's not real.

## The Natural Close

When you've done enough next steps, closing becomes natural:

> "Okay, Lenny, now we've got five folks at the organization using it. They've seen, here's the deal. They love it. What can we do, Lenny, to get going? Can we get a contract signed so we can get going on February 1st?"

This isn't aggressive—it's earned through all the previous steps.

## Works Beyond Sales

This principle applies everywhere:
- Investor meetings → Next meeting, intro requests
- Partnership discussions → Pilot agreements, technical reviews
- Internal meetings → Action items, owners, deadlines
- Hiring → Next interview stages, reference checks

Never leave a meeting without knowing what happens next.
