# Slow Your Inbox

> "If you respond to emails really fast, you respond to messages really fast, people respond back to you and then there's more to respond to. And if you slow down that little hamster wheel, it slows down." - Jake Knapp

## What It Is

Slow Your Inbox is the observation that your email volume is partly determined by your response speed. Fast responses create fast responses back, which creates more to respond to. The inbox is a hamster wheel that spins as fast as you run.

The counterintuitive solution: respond more slowly. This doesn't mean ignoring email—it means checking less frequently, responding less immediately, and letting go of the "inbox zero" compulsion. The result is that the entire system slows down, reducing total email volume over time.

This complements Reset Expectations (telling people you'll be slow) by actually being slow. Together, they break the cycle of escalating email urgency.

## How It Works

### The Email Feedback Loop

**Fast Response Pattern:**
1. You respond within minutes
2. Sender responds quickly back
3. Conversation accelerates
4. More threads get created
5. Inbox volume increases
6. More pressure to respond fast
7. Repeat

**Slow Response Pattern:**
1. You respond once or twice daily
2. Sender adjusts expectations
3. Conversations consolidate
4. Fewer total messages
5. Less pressure overall
6. Inbox volume decreases

### The Inbox Zero Trap
The goal of "inbox zero" can actually worsen the problem. Clearing your inbox feels productive but just accelerates the wheel. Every email you respond to potentially creates 1-3 more emails.

### What Actually Matters
Most email doesn't need immediate response. Most threads resolve themselves. The truly urgent finds other channels. The discipline is recognizing that responsiveness and effectiveness are not the same thing.

## How to Apply It

1. **Check email on a schedule, not reactively**
   - Pick 2-3 times per day (e.g., 9am, 1pm, 5pm)
   - Don't check between those times
   - Batch your responses

2. **Remove email from your phone**
   - If you can't check, you won't check
   - True emergencies come via text or call
   - The relief is real once you try it

3. **Let go of inbox zero**
   - Respond to what needs response
   - Archive or delete the rest
   - Not every email deserves a reply

4. **Watch the system slow down**
   - At first, some people may escalate
   - Most people simply adjust
   - Total volume decreases over weeks

5. **Pair with Reset Expectations**
   - Tell people you're checking less frequently
   - Provide an escalation path for urgency
   - The "because" makes it acceptable

### Tools That Help
- **Email batching apps** (e.g., Mailman HQ) that hold email until scheduled times
- **Turn off notifications** completely
- **Use autoresponders** that set expectations
- **Separate accounts** for different response-time needs

## When to Use It

- When email volume feels overwhelming
- When you're caught in rapid back-and-forth threads
- When email anxiety is affecting your focus
- When you notice you check email reflexively
- When important work keeps getting displaced by email
