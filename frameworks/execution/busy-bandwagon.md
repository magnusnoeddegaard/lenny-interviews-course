# Busy Bandwagon

> "Part of the busy bandwagon, or part of the infinity pools thing, is this feeling inside that I'm responsible for staying up to date with the most important news in the world, or the most important news in my inbox, or my company or my team." - Jake Knapp

## What It Is

The Busy Bandwagon is the cultural phenomenon where being busy has become the default answer and expected state. When someone asks "How's it going?", the automatic response is "Busy"—and that's considered good. Business is booming, I'm important, I'm productive.

But the real damage isn't just the actual busyness—it's the internal pressure created by perceiving that everyone else is busy. This creates a feeling that you should be busy too, that fast reactions are expected, that being responsive is mandatory. Most stress comes from this internal monologue, not from actual demands.

Jake Knapp identifies this as one of two forces (along with Infinity Pools) that create a "bad flywheel"—you feel like you need to be on top of everything, and there are products designed to exploit that feeling, which makes you feel even more behind.

## How It Works

The Busy Bandwagon operates through several mechanisms:

### Internal Pressure
- Comparing yourself to perceived productivity of others
- Feeling shame or guilt when not responding immediately
- Believing others have figured out how to handle it all
- Fear of falling behind or being seen as lazy

### External Signals
- Seeing colleagues always available on Slack
- CEOs and bosses modeling constant reactivity
- Social media showing others' accomplishments
- Work culture that celebrates "hustle"

### The Flywheel Effect
When combined with Infinity Pools (endless content and messages), the busy bandwagon creates a self-reinforcing cycle:
1. Feel pressure to stay on top of everything
2. Products are designed to capture that anxiety
3. More things compete for attention
4. Feel even more behind
5. Repeat

## How to Apply It

Recognizing the Busy Bandwagon is the first step to breaking free. Practical approaches:

1. **Name it**: When you feel the pressure to respond immediately, ask: "Is this real urgency or the busy bandwagon?"

2. **Renegotiate with yourself**: Most expectations of instant response are self-imposed. The feeling that you "should" respond quickly is often just anxiety.

3. **Reset expectations externally**: Use email signatures or conversations to signal slower response times (see Reset Expectations framework).

4. **Find the relief**: When you step away from the bandwagon, notice the feeling of relief that "I don't have to check this." That feeling is evidence of how much stress the default creates.

5. **Question the model**: People in power (CEOs) apply their influence through constant reactivity—but that's their job. For most people, being a "reaction machine" means no meaningful work gets done.

## When to Use It

- When you feel stressed about how quickly you're responding to messages
- When you notice yourself saying "I'm so busy" as a default
- When comparing yourself to seemingly productive others
- When designing team communication norms
- When coaching others who seem overwhelmed
