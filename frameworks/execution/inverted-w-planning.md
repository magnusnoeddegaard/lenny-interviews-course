# Inverted W Planning

> "We run a kind of inverted W process. We typically have teams surface what their immediate thoughts are on the most important things to do. We'll then have a group of product leaders get together and try to synthesize the most important parts of that into a kind of draft overall company strategy, and then take that back down to teams to figure out, 'Well, if that's where we're making a big push, should that tweak my plans at all?' We bring it back up for synthesis, and then back down for everyone to really distribute with a lot of context within their orgs." - David Singleton

## What It Is

Inverted W Planning is a strategic planning process that alternates between bottom-up team input and top-down leadership synthesis multiple times. Rather than pure top-down (executives dictate strategy) or pure bottom-up (teams propose and leadership approves), this approach cycles through four phases that form a "W" shape when visualized: up from teams, down from leadership, up again for refinement, and down for final distribution.

The key insight is that neither teams nor executives alone have complete information. Teams understand ground-level reality and opportunities. Leadership can see across teams and align to company-wide strategy. The W process captures both perspectives iteratively.

## How It Works

1. **Teams surface initial priorities** (bottom up): Individual teams identify what they believe are the most important things to do based on user needs and product opportunities.

2. **Leadership synthesizes** (top down): Product leaders gather team input and synthesize it into a draft company strategy, identifying where to make big pushes.

3. **Teams refine based on strategy** (bottom up again): Teams receive the draft strategy and adjust their plans - "If that's where we're making a big push, should that tweak my plans?"

4. **Final leadership synthesis** (top down): Leadership brings refined plans back up for final synthesis and alignment.

5. **Distribution with context** (down to teams): Final strategy is distributed back to teams with full context about why decisions were made.

## How to Apply It

Actionable steps for implementing Inverted W Planning:

1. **Start with team proposals** - Have each team independently document their priorities based on user needs and opportunities
2. **Bring leaders together** - Convene product leaders to review all proposals and identify themes and conflicts
3. **Create a draft strategy** - Synthesize team input into a coherent draft that identifies major company-wide priorities
4. **Share back to teams** - Let teams review the draft strategy and adjust their plans accordingly
5. **Iterate once more** - Bring refined plans back to leadership for final alignment
6. **Distribute with rationale** - Share final decisions with full context so teams understand the "why"

## When to Use It

- Annual or semi-annual strategic planning
- When you've grown past the point where one person can hold all context
- When teams need autonomy but also need alignment
- When you want to balance ground-level insight with company-wide priorities
- When previous planning processes felt either too top-down or too chaotic
