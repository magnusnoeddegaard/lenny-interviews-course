# Friday Celebrations

> "People do not value celebrations enough. I've had CEOs who said, 'Well, it was the middle of the quarter, so we didn't start OKRs, but we did start Friday celebrations and oh my God, things are already changing. Things are already getting better.'" - Christina Wodtke

## What It Is

Friday Celebrations is a weekly ritual where teams gather to share and acknowledge the wins from the past week. Unlike status meetings focused on what's not done or Monday planning sessions focused on what's ahead, Friday Celebrations deliberately focus on what went right.

The practice is deceptively simple but creates powerful effects on team morale and culture. By ending each week acknowledging accomplishments, teams feel like they're part of something meaningful—even before implementing any formal goal-setting process.

## How It Works

The celebration follows a simple format where team members share positive highlights:

**The Core Question:**
"What was the most awesome thing that happened this week?"

**The Coverage:**
- What's awesome from your work personally?
- What's awesome that happened in [other team/department]?
- What did [specific function like design or engineering] do this week that was great?

**The Mechanics:**
- Brief gathering at end of week (Friday)
- Each person/team shares a win
- Focus on recognition and appreciation, not just progress metrics
- Keep it quick but genuine

## How to Apply It

1. **Schedule a recurring Friday slot** - 15-30 minutes at the end of the day works well.

2. **Open with the question** - "What was the most awesome thing that happened this week?" Go around the room/call.

3. **Cross-pollinate recognition** - Ask people to recognize wins they observed in other teams, not just their own. This builds appreciation across silos.

4. **Keep it consistent** - The power comes from the weekly rhythm. Don't skip weeks even when things are tough.

5. **Model vulnerability** - Leaders should share their wins too, including small ones. This gives permission for everyone to celebrate.

6. **Don't add agenda items** - Keep this purely celebratory. The moment it becomes a status meeting, it loses its power.

## When to Use It

**Ideal for:**
- Any team that wants to improve morale without big process changes
- Companies implementing OKRs (pairs with Monday commitments)
- Remote/distributed teams that need connection rituals
- High-stress environments where wins go unnoticed
- Teams where people feel like their work doesn't matter

**The surprising insight:** CEOs report this single practice changes company culture even before any formal goal-setting is in place.

## Why It Works

- **Retrieval practice** - Weekly recognition helps people remember and internalize what went well
- **Social validation** - Public acknowledgment satisfies a fundamental human need
- **Counter-balancing negativity** - Work naturally surfaces problems; celebrations create deliberate balance
- **Building meaning** - Helps people feel they're "part of something really special"
- **Temporal landmark** - Friday provides a natural boundary that makes the ritual stick
