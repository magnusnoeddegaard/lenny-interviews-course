# Readiness vs Awareness

> "There's two things. There's the knowing something's coming and then there's the knowing what to do with it." - Christine Itwaru

## What It Is

A critical distinction in launch execution: awareness that something is happening is not the same as readiness to act on it. Organizations often confuse the two, leading to failed launches where everyone technically knew about the release but nobody was prepared to support it.

This framework emerged from Pendo's experience with a "really bad launch" in Christine Itwaru's fifth week—the biggest launch in company history since the product itself. Teams knew it was coming, they received training, but they didn't understand the extent of what to expect or how to prepare customers and prospects.

## How It Works

**Awareness** answers:
- What is launching?
- When is it launching?
- What features does it include?

**Readiness** answers:
- How should I position this with customers?
- What questions will customers ask?
- How does this impact my role specifically?
- What should I do differently starting now?
- How do I get customers ready for this change?

The gap between awareness and readiness is where launches fail. You can send status updates, maintain a roadmap, announce dates—and still have teams unprepared because they don't know what to do with the information.

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your current communication** - For your next launch, ask: "Does this help people know something is coming, or know what to do?" If it's only the former, you have a readiness gap

2. **Create role-specific playbooks** - Don't just announce features. Create content for each stakeholder group:
   - Sales: How to position, objections to expect, competitive angles
   - Success: How to enable existing customers, training to provide
   - Support: New tickets to expect, escalation paths, documentation
   - Marketing: Messaging, launch timing, demand generation

3. **Test for readiness, not awareness** - Before launch, quiz key stakeholders: "A customer asks about X. What do you tell them?" If they can't answer, you have awareness but not readiness

4. **Treat content as part of done** - Define-of-done for product development should include readiness materials, not just code and QA

5. **Build feedback loops** - After launch, measure the quality of questions coming to product. "Teach me how this works" indicates readiness failure. "Here's what our customers need next" indicates readiness success

## When to Use It

Use this framework when:
- You're planning any significant launch that affects multiple teams
- Past launches have "surprised" teams despite communication
- Stakeholders complain they weren't prepared despite roadmap visibility
- Customer-facing teams are fielding basic questions post-launch
- You want to assess the quality of your internal communication
