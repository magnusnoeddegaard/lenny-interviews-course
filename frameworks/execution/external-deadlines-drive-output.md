# External Deadlines Drive Output

> "I was a great, I think I was a really diligent employee. I always tried to get my work done, show up on time, I tried to meet all expectations. But what I noticed is, when I started to work for myself, it just went out the window." - Gergely Orosz

## What It Is

When you work for yourself—as a creator, freelancer, or entrepreneur—internal motivation often fails. The structure that made you productive as an employee disappears. Gergely discovered that the solution is creating external commitments that force you to deliver, regardless of how you feel.

This is why he promised subscribers two posts per week, why authors get book contracts (not for the advance, but for the deadline), and why Alexander Dumas wrote The Three Musketeers in weekly magazine installments. Public commitment to others creates accountability that self-discipline cannot match.

## How It Works

**The Problem:**
- Without bosses, meetings, or deadlines, unstructured time expands
- Self-employed people often feel guilty about not being productive enough
- Internal goals can be rationalized away when you're the only one tracking them

**The Solution:**
- Make public promises that create real obligations
- Structure your commitments so others are counting on you
- Use the deadline pressure to focus your work

**Why It Works:**
1. **Social contract** - Breaking a promise to others feels worse than breaking one to yourself
2. **Economic incentive** - Subscribers paying creates accountability
3. **Reputation risk** - Your professional standing depends on delivery
4. **External structure** - Deadlines create the framework that employment provided

## How to Apply It

1. **Announce a cadence** - Tell your audience exactly when they can expect content
2. **Start a paid product** - When people pay, you owe them something
3. **Get a contract** - Publishers, clients, or collaborators create external pressure
4. **Create dependencies** - Structure work so others are waiting on you

Gergely's approach: "I told people, 'You're going to get this every week,' and now I have to do it. I just have no choice."

## When to Use It

- When transitioning from employee to self-employed
- When launching a newsletter, podcast, or content business
- When writing a book (seek a publisher for the deadline, not the advance)
- When you notice unstructured time leading to lower output

## The Forcing Function

Gergely found that almost every day of his week has pressure to write because of his external commitments:

- **Monday**: Finish the Tuesday post
- **Tuesday**: Publish and do free writing
- **Wednesday afternoon**: Start Thursday newsletter
- **Thursday**: Finish and publish Thursday newsletter
- **Friday**: Write for next Tuesday

"So almost every day except for Wednesday, I have a strong pressure to write."

## Warnings

- Don't over-commit initially—start with what you can sustain
- The stress is real—external deadlines create external pressure
- Build in flexibility—Gergely added his second weekly post only after proving the first
