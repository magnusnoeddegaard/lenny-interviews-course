# GIST Board

> "If you do have this, you create a lot more context in the minds of your team and then they need to ask you fewer questions. You need to tell them less what to do. They know what's success and they are able to actually do a lot more on their own." - Itamar Gilad

## What It Is

The GIST Board is a project management tool that brings together the top three layers of the GIST model - Goals, Ideas, and Steps - in one visible artifact for a team. Unlike traditional backlogs that focus purely on tasks, the GIST Board shows WHY the team is doing what they're doing and HOW they're validating that they're on the right track.

It bridges the gap between the "planning world" (managers, stakeholders, roadmaps) and the "Agile world" (developers focused on moving tickets), giving everyone shared context and ownership.

## How It Works

**Structure**
The board has three columns/sections per team:

1. **Goals (Key Results)**: Maximum 4 key results from your OKRs, showing the outcomes you're trying to achieve. These come from your metrics trees.

2. **Ideas**: The current ideas you're working on to achieve those goals, often with ICE scores visible. These are hypotheses about how to move the metrics.

3. **Steps**: The next validation steps for each idea - not engineering milestones but learning milestones. What will you test/measure next?

**Example**
| Goals | Ideas | Steps |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Avg onboarding time < 2 days (currently 5.5) | Onboarding wizard (ICE: 7/6/8) | 1. Usability test with mockups |
| | | 2. Usability test with prototype |
| | | 3. A/B test |
| Feature adoption > 40% (currently 25%) | In-app tutorials | 1. User interviews on friction points |
| | | 2. Competitive analysis |

**Dynamics**
- The board changes actively as you learn
- Ideas get removed when evidence is negative
- Steps get updated based on results
- Goals might shift if you achieve them or realize they're wrong
- Not a static roadmap - a living learning document

## How to Apply It

1. **Create one board per team**: Each team needs their own focused board, not a company-wide one.

2. **Start with key results**: At the beginning of each quarter, copy your team's OKRs (max 4 key results) into the Goals column.

3. **Let the team pick ideas**: Managers and stakeholders can propose ideas, but the team (especially PM) uses ICE scoring to decide which to test first.

4. **Define learning steps, not just building steps**: Each idea should have associated validation steps. "Build feature X" is not a step. "Test X with 10 users and measure Y" is a step.

5. **Meet around it regularly**: At least every two weeks, review: Are these still the right ideas? What did we learn from recent steps? What's blocking us?

6. **Update actively**: When a step completes with negative results, immediately decide: pivot the idea, try a different test, or kill it. Don't let failed ideas linger.

7. **Share evidence broadly**: When steps generate results (positive or negative), share with stakeholders. This builds trust and can shift opinions.

## When to Use It

- **Delivery-focused teams that need discovery**: When engineers are only focused on shipping, not learning
- **Teams stuck in the PM bottleneck**: When the PM is exhausted translating between planning and execution
- **Teams with unclear context**: When developers don't understand why they're building what they're building
- **Outcome-oriented organizations**: When you want to manage to outcomes, not outputs
- **Alternatives to traditional roadmaps**: When release roadmaps are causing more harm than good
