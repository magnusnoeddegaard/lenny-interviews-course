# Soft Launch vs Hard Launch

> "When this new thing comes out, that's a soft launch. As soon as that soft launch is out, great, let's kick off this launch meeting with launch steps. Now you've got something else to go do. And it's so much better for marketing anyways because they're not setting up their launch steps based on something that they don't have eyes on." - Janna Bastow

## What It Is

Soft Launch vs Hard Launch is a coordination framework that decouples when engineering finishes a feature from when marketing promotes it to the world. Instead of trying to synchronize two fundamentally different types of work to hit the same date, you separate them into sequential phases.

This approach eliminates one of the most common sources of timeline pressure and cross-functional friction: the attempt to coordinate development schedules (inherently uncertain) with marketing campaigns (which require lead time and planning).

## How It Works

**Two Distinct Phases:**

1. **Soft Launch** - When engineering completes the feature and it goes live
   - Feature is functional and in production
   - Available to early users or beta testers
   - Marketing isn't yet promoting it externally
   - Team can iterate and fix issues

2. **Hard Launch** - When marketing fully promotes the feature
   - Marketing has a working product to showcase
   - Can gather real testimonials from early users
   - Can create accurate screenshots and videos
   - Full promotional campaign begins

**The Coordination Flow:**

```
Development → Soft Launch → Marketing Prep → Hard Launch
     |            |              |              |
  Building    Go Live      2-6 weeks       Promote
```

During the marketing prep phase:
- Marketing works with a real, functional product
- Sales can show actual demos, not mockups
- Customer success can gather testimonials
- Development continues with the next priority

## How to Apply It

1. **Establish the separation upfront** - Set expectations with stakeholders that development completion and marketing launch are different milestones.

2. **Define soft launch criteria** - What's the minimum bar for soft launch? Feature-complete? Performance benchmarks? Core happy path working?

3. **Plan marketing lead time** - Determine how much time marketing needs between soft and hard launch. This could be days, weeks, or months depending on the scale.

4. **Use soft launch for validation** - Treat the soft launch period as a buffer to find and fix issues before the spotlight is on.

5. **Keep development moving** - While marketing prepares the hard launch, engineering should be working on the next priority, not waiting.

## When to Use It

- For any feature launch that involves marketing coordination
- When development timelines are uncertain
- When marketing needs real assets (screenshots, videos, testimonials) to create campaigns
- When you want to reduce pressure on engineering to hit arbitrary dates
- When features need a beta period before full rollout

## Benefits

**For Engineering:**
- Less pressure to hit arbitrary marketing dates
- Can ship when ready rather than when scheduled
- Time to fix issues before high-visibility launch

**For Marketing:**
- Working with real, functional products
- Accurate screenshots and demos
- Real user testimonials
- No scrambling when features slip

**For the Organization:**
- Reduces cross-functional friction
- Higher quality launches
- More predictable marketing calendar (based on soft launches that already happened)

## Common Mistakes

- **Skipping soft launch** - Going straight to hard launch means marketing is working blind
- **Making soft launch too short** - Allow enough time for marketing to prepare quality materials
- **Letting soft launch become limbo** - Every soft launch should have a hard launch plan
