# Highlight Method

> "The notion with the highlight is imagine it's the end of the day if someone asks you, 'What was the highlight of your day,' what would you say? That's the anchor of everything. That's the core, that's the foundation." - Jake Knapp

## What It Is

The Highlight Method is the core of the Make Time system—a simple practice of choosing one thing each day that you want to be your "highlight." Instead of trying to accomplish many things or empty your inbox, you focus on making one meaningful moment happen.

The insight comes from observing that most days, people don't get anything they're truly proud of done. They're distracted by small tasks, email, and meetings. The highlight creates a different frame: if you accomplish one thing you care about, that's a great day—even if everything else is chaotic.

John Zeratsky originally developed this concept, and Jake Knapp describes it as "the most powerful best part" of their entire system. It works because it aligns daily action with what people intuitively know matters but struggle to prioritize.

## How It Works

Each morning (or the night before), ask yourself: **"If someone asks me at the end of today what the highlight of my day was, what do I want to say?"**

Your highlight should be:
- **60-90 minutes** of focused time (the minimum to really engage deeply)
- **Specific and completable** (not vague like "work on project")
- **Written down** where you'll see it

### Three Lenses for Choosing

1. **Urgency**: What absolutely has to happen today? This might be a deadline, a meeting, or something that won't wait.

2. **Satisfaction**: What would feel most meaningful to accomplish? Big projects that never get attention, creative work, deep thinking.

3. **Joy**: What would bring the most happiness? Time with family, a hobby, exercise, cooking a great meal.

The right lens changes day to day. Most days John uses satisfaction (project-focused), but he stays attuned to when he needs joy instead—a pressure release valve.

## How to Apply It

1. **Pick your highlight** in the morning or the night before
2. **Write it down** on a sticky note, in your calendar, or in a notebook
3. **Place it visible**—stuck to your monitor, on your desk, somewhere you'll see it
4. **Protect the time** by blocking 60-90 minutes on your calendar
5. **Trust your gut** about what matters—you know better than any system

### The Groundhog Day Rule
If you don't accomplish your highlight, repeat it the next day. Keep repeating until it happens. This removes the guilt of "failing" and treats each day as a fresh attempt.

### Stack Ranking
When life gets chaotic, write out your priorities in order. Be explicit about trade-offs. Sometimes work must come before family for a week; sometimes the opposite. Seeing it clearly helps you make conscious choices instead of reactive ones.

## When to Use It

- Every single day—this is meant to be a daily practice
- When you feel like days slip by without meaningful accomplishment
- When important projects keep getting pushed aside for urgent small tasks
- When you want to feel more satisfied with how you spend your time
- When life circumstances change and you need to re-anchor priorities
