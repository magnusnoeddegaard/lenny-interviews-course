# Choreography Over Control

> "I needed to move from a mindset of control to one of choreography. I needed to try to set the culture and set certain design tenets that everyone could internalize and follow and hopefully then make the right decisions in that groove." - Bob Baxley

## What It Is

As organizations grow, leaders can no longer maintain direct control over every decision. Choreography over control is the recognition that effective leadership at scale requires shifting from personally directing work to creating the conditions where distributed teams can make good decisions autonomously.

Bob Baxley discovered this at ThoughtSpot, where he had too many people across too many engineering teams (many in India) to have any "command and control" over the product. Instead, he focused on establishing design tenets—clear decision-making principles everyone could internalize—and setting the cultural tone.

Interestingly, this insight also came from Baxley's use of AI as a life coach. When he asked ChatGPT about outdated mindsets he was holding onto, it suggested his attachment to "control" might not serve him in his next chapter of writing, speaking, and advising. The phrase "choreography over control" emerged from that AI coaching session.

## How It Works

The framework involves several key shifts:

1. **From decisions to principles** - Instead of making individual calls, establish tenets that help others make aligned decisions.

2. **From inspection to culture** - Rather than reviewing every output, invest in building shared values and understanding.

3. **From approval to trust** - Move from being a bottleneck to being a culture-setter who trusts teams to execute.

4. **From tactics to philosophy** - Spend more time on "why" and "what" at a strategic level, less on "how" at the execution level.

The metaphor of choreography is apt: a choreographer doesn't control each dancer's movements in real-time. They set the vision, teach the principles of movement, rehearse the patterns, and then trust dancers to perform.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your control patterns** - Notice where you're still trying to be involved in every decision. These are candidates for choreography.

2. **Create decision-making tools** - Establish 3-4 clear tenets (not generic principles) that help teams resolve debates without you.

3. **Invest in culture-building** - Spend time articulating values, running calibration sessions, and modeling desired behaviors.

4. **Accept variance** - Choreography means some decisions won't be exactly what you'd choose. That's okay if they're within the "groove."

5. **Stay connected to outputs** - Choreography isn't abdication. Review work to ensure the culture and tenets are working, and adjust them if not.

6. **Recognize when control is appropriate** - Early-stage work, high-stakes decisions, and novel problems may still require more direct involvement.

## When to Use It

- When scaling a design, product, or engineering organization
- When working with distributed or remote teams
- When you've become a bottleneck in your organization
- When transitioning from IC to leadership
- When feeling burned out from trying to control everything
- When preparing for a role transition (like moving to advising)
