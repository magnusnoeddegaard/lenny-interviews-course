# Design Sprint

> "The big idea with a design sprint is to go from a zero to a prototype and a test of that prototype in just five days." - Jake Knapp

## What It Is

The Design Sprint is a five-day process for rapidly prototyping and testing ideas with real users. Instead of spending months building something before learning if it works, teams compress the cycle to one week: understand the problem, generate solutions, decide what to test, build a realistic prototype, and validate with customers—all in five days.

Jake Knapp developed the method at Google while working on Gmail and co-founding Google Meet. The origin story: a 20% project had been going nowhere for a year and a half. In one focused week of working together, the team cleared everything else, created a working prototype, and put it in front of colleagues. That moment of clarity—versus the paralysis of trying to perfect plans and PRDs—became the foundation for design sprints.

Jake and John Zeratsky refined the process through hundreds of sprints at Google Ventures, working with startups to find and expand product-market fit. The method is documented in their book "Sprint."

## How It Works

### The Five-Day Structure

**Day 1: Understand**
Map the problem, bring in expert perspectives, and agree on a target for the week.

**Day 2: Sketch**
Generate solutions individually. Everyone sketches ideas without groupthink, creating a diverse set of possibilities.

**Day 3: Decide**
Review sketches, critique them, and choose the strongest idea to prototype. Use structured voting rather than open debate.

**Day 4: Prototype**
Build a realistic facade of the solution—enough for users to react to, not a functioning product. "Fake it before you make it."

**Day 5: Test**
Put the prototype in front of five real target users. Watch them use it. Learn what works and what doesn't.

### Key Principles

**Change the Defaults**: The sprint controls how teams work—no phones, no email, focused attention, structured activities. This is the same philosophy as Make Time applied to teams.

**Prototype, Don't Build**: A realistic prototype takes one day to build. A real product takes months. The learning from both is similar.

**Five Users Is Enough**: Five user tests reveal about 85% of usability issues. You don't need statistical significance—you need directional learning.

**Evaluate by Observation**: Strategy and intuition are great, but watching customers react to something tangible is better. Sprints replace debate with evidence.

## How to Apply It

1. **Pick a big challenge**: Sprints work best for important problems where the path forward is unclear.

2. **Assemble the right team**: 4-7 people with diverse perspectives—design, engineering, product, business, customer insight.

3. **Block five full days**: No half-measures. Clear calendars, dedicated space, full focus.

4. **Follow the script**: The Sprint book provides hour-by-hour instructions. The structure is the magic.

5. **Include a Decider**: Someone who can make binding decisions for the team. This person breaks ties and keeps things moving.

6. **Interview real users on Friday**: Book five target customers before the sprint begins. The deadline is essential.

### Resources
- **Sprint book**: Detailed instructions for every step
- **thesprintbook.com**: Free resources including a Miro template with videos
- **Character Labs**: Intensive program running sequences of sprints with startups

## When to Use It

- When starting a new product or major feature
- When stuck in analysis paralysis
- When a project has been spinning without progress
- When you need to align a team around a direction
- When validating ideas before major investment
- When pivoting and need to test new directions quickly

### Especially Valuable For
- AI products where trust and behavior change are barriers
- Healthcare, education, and other high-stakes domains
- Pre-seed startups trying to find product-market fit
- Established companies launching new initiatives
