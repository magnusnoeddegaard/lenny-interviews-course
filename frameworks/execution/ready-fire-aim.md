# Ready Fire Aim

> "We used to actually half joke there, some of us leaders would be like, 'It's ready, fire, aim.' And it was like, people would be like, 'I'm just going to run through a wall. I have no idea if that's the right wall to run through, but at least I know I'm running through a wall.'" - JM Nickels

## What It Is

Ready Fire Aim is a cautionary observation about execution bias—when organizations prioritize action so heavily that they skip proper strategic thinking. JM Nickels observed this pattern at DoorDash, where the culture emphasized speed and wall-running sometimes at the expense of direction.

The term itself is a twist on "Ready, Aim, Fire" and captures the feeling of shooting before you've identified the target. While bias toward action is generally positive (especially vs. analysis paralysis), Ready Fire Aim can waste resources on the wrong problems.

The insight is that this is a spectrum, and different organizations err in different directions. Uber's marketplace team sometimes over-indexed on theory; DoorDash sometimes over-indexed on execution. Neither extreme is ideal.

## How It Works

**The Ready Fire Aim Pattern:**
- Strong urgency to act and ship
- Limited time spent on strategy and direction
- "I don't know if this is right, but at least we're moving"
- Learning happens through doing, sometimes expensively

**The Opposite Pattern (Theory Land):**
- Too much time deliberating and analyzing
- Beautiful whiteboard diagrams that never ship
- "This looks great in theory but I don't know how to start"
- Paralysis by analysis

**The Balance:**
- Neither extreme is optimal
- Need enough strategy to pick the right wall
- Need enough action to actually run through it
- Dynamic adjustment based on situation

**When Each Makes Sense:**
- Ready Fire Aim: When learning requires action, when costs of inaction are high
- More aiming: When strategy is unclear, when stakes are high, when you can afford to think

## How to Apply It

1. **Diagnose your bias** - Does your team/company tend toward over-analysis or over-action? Be honest.

2. **Adjust the other direction** - If you're naturally theory-heavy, force faster shipping. If you're action-heavy, force more strategic thinking.

3. **Match approach to situation** - Major pivots need more thinking. Iteration within a known strategy needs more action.

4. **If you must pick one** - JM suggests biasing toward action: "I'd rather run through the wrong wall than not do anything, because you still get learnings from that."

5. **Watch for failure modes** - Theory land: beautiful plans that never ship. Action land: effort wasted on wrong problems.

## When to Use It

- When evaluating team or company culture
- When planning sprints or quarters (how much strategy vs. execution?)
- When noticing patterns of spinning without progress
- When noticing patterns of building without learning
- During retrospectives on failed projects
- When coaching teams on finding the right balance

- **Note**: Lowenhar identifies this as the most common CEO failure mode, especially in the era when founders could "paper over poor execution with easy access to capital." His fix: basic business planning that starts with working backwards from a milestone (fundraise, exit, profitability).
