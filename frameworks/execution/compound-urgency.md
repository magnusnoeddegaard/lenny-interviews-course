# Compound Urgency

> "He understands that by pushing a road map up, even by a week, if you can continuously push up what you ship by a week, you're going to end up lapping competitors who are just one week behind because you're going to start the next thing a week sooner, and you're getting that 1.1, 1.01x return. And then it grows and grows and grows." - Keith Yandell

## What It Is

A mental model for understanding why small improvements in shipping speed matter enormously over time. Just like financial compound interest, shipping one week faster doesn't just save seven days—it accelerates every subsequent project because you start each new initiative sooner.

Tony Xu at DoorDash and Christopher Payne (President) are "frustratingly good" at creating this sense of urgency, constantly pushing to move roadmaps up even by small margins.

## How It Works

### The Math

Imagine two competitors starting at the same point:
- **Company A** ships features on schedule
- **Company B** ships one week faster on every project

After one project, Company B is one week ahead.
After ten projects, Company B has gained ten weeks—2.5 months of additional market learning, customer feedback, and iteration.

But it's worse than that for Company A. During those 2.5 months, Company B shipped additional features, learned from them, and started new projects. The gap compounds.

### The Psychology

This isn't about working harder or longer hours. It's about constantly asking:
- "Do we really need to test this thing again or can we ship it?"
- "How can we move that much faster?"
- "What's the minimum required to learn what we need?"

Even small acceleration—shipping Tuesday instead of Friday—matters when multiplied across dozens of initiatives per year.

### The DoorDash IPO Story

Keith describes DoorDash's IPO day: They had to wake up early for a virtual bell ringing. The second it was over, they had their weekly business review with tough questions. No champagne being passed around, just "How are we going to serve our customers today?"

This wasn't asceticism for its own sake—it was compound urgency in action. Every hour spent celebrating is an hour not spent on the next thing.

### The Reference Point

Keith cites a saying (possibly from athletics): "Somewhere, someone out there is practicing, and when you meet them, they will beat you."

If you take too long being self-congratulatory, you fall behind the people who are still hungry.

## How to Apply It

1. **Question every delay** - For each timeline, ask: "What would it take to ship this a week earlier?" Not "can we ship earlier if we work overtime" but "what could we cut or defer?"

2. **Reframe small wins as compound** - A one-week improvement sounds trivial. Frame it as "one week on every project this year = 50 weeks of compound advantage."

3. **Celebrate briefly, then move** - Acknowledgment matters, but extended celebration has compound costs.

4. **Model it from the top** - Tony and Christopher's urgency is described as "frustrating" because it never lets up. Leaders must embody this.

5. **Track shipping velocity** - Make "time from decision to launch" a metric you monitor.

## When to Use It

- **Competitive markets** - Where speed determines who captures opportunities
- **Early-stage companies** - Where learning velocity matters most
- **Platform businesses** - Where network effects amplify first-mover advantage
- **Annual planning** - Frame the full year's potential compound gains
- **After any success** - The moment when urgency naturally drops is when to invoke this most

## The Trade-off

This isn't "ship broken things faster." Quality still matters. The question is: what's the minimum quality bar, and are you overshooting it?

Keith notes that at DoorDash, WeDash (their customer empathy program) catches quality issues early. Urgency + customer obsession keeps speed and quality aligned.
