# Data-Informed Product Loop

> "You need a strategy, you need to develop qualitative models, you need to add measurement to those models... You need to prioritize where to focus. You need to design bets, you need to measure the impact of those bets. And then you need to circulate what you learned back into the strategy, back into your models, back into how you prioritize." - John Cutler

## What It Is

The Data-Informed Product Loop is a comprehensive framework developed at Amplitude that describes how high-performing product teams create continuous learning cycles. Rather than treating data as an afterthought or metrics as standalone goals, this framework shows how measurement integrates into every phase of product work.

The key insight is that skill development comes from completing full loops, not just accumulating knowledge. Teams that go through this entire cycle repeatedly build compounding capability.

## How It Works

The loop consists of six interconnected phases:

1. **Strategy** - Define your strategic direction and what you're trying to achieve
2. **Develop Qualitative Models** - Create frameworks like North Star metrics that describe how your product creates value
3. **Add Measurement** - Attach metrics and tracking to your qualitative models
4. **Prioritize** - Use your models and data to decide where to focus
5. **Design Bets** - Create experiments and initiatives to test your hypotheses
6. **Measure Impact** - Evaluate what happened and why

The critical final step: **Circulate Learning** - Feed insights back into strategy, models, prioritization, and future bets.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify where you're weak** - Most teams break the loop somewhere:
   - No strategy? Nothing downstream works
   - Strategy but no models? Can't prioritize
   - Models but no measurement? Can't learn
   - Ship but don't measure impact? No feedback
   - Measure but don't circulate learning? Wasted insight

2. **Get reps** - Focus on completing full loops, even small ones, rather than perfecting any single step

3. **Start with qualitative models** - Before jumping to metrics, understand the system you're trying to measure (e.g., "What behaviors indicate users are getting value?")

4. **Prioritize learning circulation** - Many teams measure impact but fail to feed it back into strategy and models. Build explicit practices for this.

5. **Embrace uncertainty** - You don't need perfect data to progress. You need to reduce uncertainty enough to make the next decision.

## When to Use It

- When building or improving your product development process
- When auditing why your team isn't improving over time
- When implementing analytics (don't just track events - connect to strategy)
- When onboarding new product managers
- When feeling overwhelmed by product advice (use this to organize what you're learning)
