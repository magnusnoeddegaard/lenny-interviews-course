# Think It Build It Ship It Tweak It

> "I think off the cuff, I said, 'Well, it's four phases. It's think it, build it, ship it, tweak it.' And then the think it phase, it should be cheap, not a lot of money spent. In the build it phase, you're going to start spending a lot of money. So then you must have reduced the risk in the think it phase that you're right." - Gustav Söderström

## What It Is

A four-phase framework for product development that makes investment escalation explicit. The key insight is that each phase has a dramatically different cost profile, and the primary job of earlier phases is to de-risk later phases.

What started as an off-the-cuff explanation at Spotify became sticky internal vocabulary because it provides a simple mental model for where a project is and what should be happening. "We're in the think it phase" immediately communicates expectations.

## How It Works

**Phase 1: Think It**
- **Investment**: Low (time, not money)
- **Goal**: Reduce risk before heavy spending starts
- **Activities**: Research, prototyping, validation, exploration
- **Exit Criteria**: Confidence that building is worth the cost

**Phase 2: Build It**
- **Investment**: High (engineering, design, infrastructure)
- **Goal**: Create the product/feature
- **Activities**: Development, design, testing
- **Risk**: This is where most money is spent—think it phase should have de-risked

**Phase 3: Ship It**
- **Investment**: Medium (launch, marketing, support)
- **Goal**: Get to users
- **Activities**: Release, monitor, support, initial marketing
- **Outcome**: Real user data begins

**Phase 4: Tweak It**
- **Investment**: Variable (optimization resources)
- **Goal**: Improve based on reality
- **Activities**: Iterate, optimize, A/B test, respond to feedback
- **Outcome**: Product reaches intended performance

**The Investment Escalation:**
```
Think It  →  Build It  →  Ship It  →  Tweak It
   $           $$$           $$          $-$$
```

## How to Apply It

1. **Use it as vocabulary** - "What phase are we in?" creates immediate alignment on expectations and activities.

2. **Gate phase transitions** - Don't move from Think It to Build It without demonstrating reduced risk. What did you learn? Why should we invest?

3. **Match activities to phase** - If you're in Think It, don't build production code. If you're in Tweak It, don't redesign from scratch.

4. **Keep Think It cheap** - Resist the urge to over-invest in thinking. The goal is enough confidence to build, not perfect knowledge.

5. **Plan for Tweak It** - Many teams plan only through Ship It. Budget time and resources for post-launch iteration.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Skipping Think It entirely → expensive Build It failures
- Think It that never ends → analysis paralysis
- Shipping without planning for Tweak It → abandoned launches
- Building during Think It → sunk cost fallacy pressure

## When to Use It

- When explaining where a project is to stakeholders
- When planning resource allocation across phases
- When a team is confused about what they should be doing
- When diagnosing why a project failed (which phase broke down?)
