# Designs as Motivation

> "We use designs as a way to motivate teams. So we spend a lot of time with designers crafting out what the future of this thing could look like and that's also extremely motivating. So we constantly go back to these cornerstone, Loom walkthroughs of Figma prototypes." - Geoff Charles

## What It Is

Designs as Motivation is Ramp's practice of investing heavily in visionary design prototypes—not for specification, but for inspiration. When teams can see what the future could look like, they become motivated to build it. The designs become "cornerstones" that teams return to repeatedly for alignment and energy.

This works alongside market comparables (large public companies like Bill.com, Expensify, Coupa) and revenue goals to create motivation. But designs add something unique: a tangible vision of the outcome that makes ambitious goals feel achievable.

The format matters too: Loom video walkthroughs of Figma prototypes create an emotional experience that static specs cannot. Teams can watch the designer explain their vision, see how flows connect, and feel what the product could become.

## How It Works

**The investment:**
Designers spend significant time on visionary prototypes—not detailed production specs, but explorations of what the future could look like. This feels expensive in the moment but pays off through sustained motivation.

**The format:**
- Figma prototypes (interactive, explorable)
- Loom video walkthroughs (emotional, explanatory)
- Regularly referenced "cornerstone" artifacts

**How it complements other motivation sources:**

1. **Market comparables** - "When you look at Bill.com, they're a publicly traded company... these are all large players that are actually very motivating and largely de-risk some of the business decisions you're making."

2. **Revenue goals** - "Go attack that market and go drive that revenue is very motivating."

3. **Visionary designs** - "What the future of this thing could look like is extremely motivating."

## How to Apply It

**1. Create dedicated design investment time**
Don't just have designers spec what's already decided. Give them time to explore what's possible and create compelling visions of the future.

**2. Make walkthroughs, not just mocks**
Record Loom videos explaining the vision. The designer's narrative creates emotional connection that static images cannot.

**3. Create referenceable artifacts**
The best designs become "cornerstones"—artifacts teams return to repeatedly to stay aligned on where they're heading.

**4. Connect vision to achievable goals**
Pair the visionary design with market comparables and revenue goals. This makes the vision feel like a destination you can actually reach.

**5. Update the vision as you progress**
Revisit cornerstone designs periodically. Have designers update the vision to reflect what you've learned and where you're heading next.

## When to Use It

- Kicking off a major new initiative
- When teams feel disconnected from outcomes
- To complement revenue or OKR-based goal setting
- When motivation is flagging mid-project

## Common Mistakes

**Treating design as specification only:**
Designs that only document what's already decided miss the motivational opportunity. Invest in exploration.

**Static artifacts instead of walkthroughs:**
Loom walkthroughs create a different emotional experience than Figma links. The designer's voice and narrative matter.

**One and done:**
The best designs are referenced repeatedly, not created and forgotten. Build the habit of returning to cornerstone visions.
