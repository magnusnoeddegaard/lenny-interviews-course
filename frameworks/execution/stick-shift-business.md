# Stick Shift Business

> "I like to draw these parallels because this is how I see the world. It reminded me of our business, actually. I think we have a very stick shift business. We have a very direct business. Everything's very, very tight, very straightforward. There are not a lot of layers of abstractions." - Jason Fried

## What It Is

Stick Shift Business is a metaphor for running a company with direct, unabstracted connections between you and the work—like driving a manual transmission car where you physically feel the road, control the gears, and stay engaged with the machine.

The opposite is the "automatic transmission" business: layers of management, abstracted metrics, intermediaries between decision-makers and customers, dashboards instead of conversations. Modern cars (and modern businesses) add convenience but remove connection.

The metaphor captures something important: there's value in the harder, more engaged way of operating. When you feel the work directly, you make better decisions. When everything is mediated through layers and dashboards, you lose touch with reality.

## How It Works

**Automatic Transmission Business**:
- Many layers between leadership and work
- Decisions based on reports, not direct observation
- Metrics dashboards instead of customer conversations
- Specialists handle narrow functions
- Comfort prioritized over connection
- "Simulated" feel through abstractions

**Stick Shift Business**:
- Few layers between leadership and work
- Decisions based on direct involvement
- Regular contact with actual customers
- Generalists who understand the whole system
- Engagement prioritized over comfort
- Direct feel of the road

**What Direct Connection Enables**:
- Faster feedback loops
- Better intuition from lived experience
- Catching problems before they show up in metrics
- More satisfying work
- Decisions grounded in reality, not reports

## How to Apply It

1. **Stay close to the work**: Leaders should regularly do the actual work—write code, answer support tickets, talk to customers.

2. **Minimize management layers**: Each layer is an abstraction that reduces signal fidelity. Fewer layers = more direct connection.

3. **Talk to customers directly**: Not through surveys or analytics—actual conversations with actual people.

4. **Be skeptical of dashboards**: Dashboards are summaries. Summaries lose information. Go to the source regularly.

5. **Keep teams small**: Small teams can stay direct. Large teams require management layers.

6. **Value the harder path**: Automatic is easier. Stick shift requires more engagement. The engagement is the point.

## When to Use It

- Designing organizational structure
- Deciding how much to delegate
- Evaluating whether you're losing touch with customers
- Building company culture around craft and directness
- Choosing between convenience and connection
