# Low Burn, Many Shots on Goal

> "Keep the burn rate as low as possible, because you need as many shots on goal as you can possibly get. Because you have no idea." - Eric Simons

## What It Is

This framework is a capital allocation philosophy for early-stage startups: minimize burn rate to maximize the number of strategic experiments you can run before finding product-market fit. It's not about being cheap—it's about extending your runway to increase your odds of success through more attempts.

Eric Simons and his co-founder learned this from bootstrapping their previous company. When they started StackBlitz, they didn't raise money for the first two to three years and bootstrapped instead. Even after raising, they barely spent the capital. This discipline allowed them to survive seven years and take the shot that became Bolt.

## How It Works

**Core Principle**: Every dollar saved is another experiment you can run, another pivot you can make, another month you can survive until you find what works.

**The Math**:
- If you have $1M and burn $100K/month, you get 10 shots
- If you have $1M and burn $50K/month, you get 20 shots
- Your odds of finding PMF roughly double

**Implementation**:
1. Default to "no" on spending
2. Negotiate everything ("We're a tiny startup. Can you sell it for half?")
3. Hire slowly and deliberately
4. Only accelerate spend when you see genuine market pull

## How to Apply It

1. **Until you see pull, don't spend money** - "Unless you're seeing immediate demand and pull, you should be default no"

2. **Negotiate every purchase** - Eric recommends asking vendors for discounts simply because you're a startup

3. **Resist pressure to scale prematurely** - During 2020-2021, the consensus was to hire aggressively and grow headcount. StackBlitz resisted. If they hadn't, "there would be no Bolt"

4. **Make every dollar stretch beyond reasonable** - This requires creativity, not just frugality

5. **Accept that this requires going against consensus** - "There are periods of time where you have to make judgment calls that are not going to be the consensus view"

## When to Use It

- Pre-product-market fit (always)
- When building deep technology that requires patient capital
- When the market isn't ready for your vision yet
- During economic downturns when capital is expensive

## When to Abandon It

Once you have genuine product-market pull—people pulling the product out of your hands—you can and should invest to capture the opportunity. Eric's team went from trying to add "maybe 100K ARR" to adding $20M ARR in two months. At that point, the constraint shifts from runway to execution speed.

## Contrast with "Blitzscaling"

This framework directly contradicts the blitzscaling mentality of spending aggressively to capture market share. Eric explicitly notes that the 2020-2021 era advice to triple headcount and kick up burn rate would have killed StackBlitz. The right time to blitzscale is after you've found PMF, not before.
