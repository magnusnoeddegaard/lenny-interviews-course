# What's Holding You Back Question

> "We don't want to hear updates, we don't want to hear strategy questions. We want to understand what's slowing you down or what's holding you back from moving even faster." - Gustaf Alstromer

## What It Is

The "What's Holding You Back?" question is the central diagnostic tool used in YC Office Hours to cut through noise and identify the real blockers preventing startup progress. Gustaf Alstromer explains that by asking this simple question, founders are forced to crystallize their priorities and surface the true constraints on their growth.

This approach assumes founders have a goal, and the question shifts focus from general updates or abstract strategy discussions to the specific obstacles preventing faster progress toward that goal.

## How It Works

### The Office Hours Dynamic

In regular YC Office Hours (one-on-one with founders), the question is used to:

1. **Skip the updates** - Founders naturally want to share what they've done, but that's backward-looking
2. **Avoid strategy debates** - Abstract discussions about market positioning don't move the needle
3. **Surface the real blocker** - Force identification of the single biggest constraint

### Why Founders Don't Know the Answer

Gustaf notes that usually the founders don't know what's slowing them down when asked directly. The conversation and probing questions help both the founders and advisors discover the real blocker together.

The question works because:
- It assumes there's always something slowing you down
- It presumes you could be moving faster
- It demands specificity rather than generalities
- It connects blockers to defined goals

### The Crystallization Effect

By asking what's holding you back, you're forced to:
1. Define what your current goal actually is
2. Identify the things driving toward that goal
3. Recognize what's preventing faster progress
4. Prioritize among multiple potential blockers

## How to Apply It

### For Self-Diagnosis

Ask yourself weekly:
1. **What is my current primary goal?** (Be specific: "Close 5 enterprise customers" not "grow revenue")
2. **What specific thing is the biggest obstacle to achieving that goal faster?**
3. **What would I do differently if that obstacle didn't exist?**

### For Team Meetings

Transform status updates into problem-solving sessions:
- Replace "What did you accomplish this week?" with "What's holding you back from moving faster?"
- Don't accept "nothing" as an answer - there's always something
- Dig into the specifics of each blocker

### For Advisors and Mentors

When meeting with founders or colleagues:
- Open with the question immediately
- Resist the urge to catch up on news first
- Probe to help them discover what they don't yet know is blocking them

## When to Use It

- **Weekly check-ins** - Either personal or with your team
- **Advisor meetings** - Most valuable use of limited time
- **When feeling stuck** - The question forces articulation of the problem
- **When progress has stalled** - Identifies whether you're working on the right things

## The Underlying Philosophy

This question embodies YC's execution-first mindset. As Gustaf explains, at the early stage, strategy doesn't matter because you can only do one thing at a time. The question of "what's holding you back" assumes:

1. You should be executing, not strategizing
2. Speed is the primary metric that matters
3. There's always a constraint worth identifying
4. Most founders don't naturally prioritize correctly
