# GTM as Product

> "The experience that you have of being sold to will increasingly actually differentiate a company and drive buying decisions if products are only different at the margin." - Jeanne DeWitt Grosser

## What It Is

GTM as Product is the philosophy that your go-to-market process should be designed with the same care and intentionality as your product. As software becomes more commoditized and technical differentiation narrows, how customers experience being sold to becomes a meaningful competitive advantage.

Just as product teams map user journeys and optimize every touchpoint, go-to-market teams should create a customer buying journey that feels like a series of unique, valuable experiences rather than a transactional sales process.

The insight came from observing how Gmail's massive technical differentiation in 2004 (a gigabyte of storage when competitors offered megabytes) gave way to a more commoditized software landscape. When products are only different at the margins, the buying experience itself becomes the differentiator.

## How It Works

The framework treats the entire customer lifecycle as a product:

1. **Map the Journey**: Document every touchpoint from first awareness through to becoming a retained, high-LTV customer
2. **Design Experiences**: For each touchpoint, ask: "How can this feel like a unique experience rather than a transaction?"
3. **Add Value Unconditionally**: Every interaction should provide value whether or not the customer buys
4. **Create Assets**: Turn discovery calls into collaborative sessions that leave the customer with something useful
5. **Personalize at Scale**: Use data and AI to make each interaction feel tailored to the specific customer

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit Your Current Process**: Walk through your sales process as a customer would experience it. Note where it feels transactional or boring.

2. **Transform Discovery Calls**: Instead of interrogating prospects with questions, try collaborative whiteboarding sessions. At Stripe, sales would have prospects draw their payments architecture—customers learned as much as salespeople did.

3. **Create Leaving Value**: Ensure customers get something useful from every interaction even if they don't buy. Share benchmarking data, industry insights, or analysis they couldn't easily get elsewhere.

4. **Build Replicable Wow Moments**: Identify 2-3 moments in your sales process that can become signature experiences unique to your company.

5. **Measure Experience**: Track not just conversion rates but qualitative feedback on the buying experience.

## When to Use It

- When your product is in a competitive market with multiple similar offerings
- When you're selling to sophisticated buyers who have many options
- When you want to build long-term relationships, not just close deals
- When your sales cycle is long enough to have multiple touchpoints
- When customers who don't buy today might buy in 3-5 years
