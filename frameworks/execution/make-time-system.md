# Make Time System

> "It's not really about productivity, it's not about time management. It's really just about, look, at any given day, we're lucky if we can have one great moment where we have our peak attention and we use it well." - Jake Knapp

## What It Is

The Make Time System is a four-part framework for taking control of your daily time and attention. Unlike traditional productivity systems that focus on getting faster at tasks already in front of you, Make Time focuses on changing your defaults so you can spend time on what actually matters to you.

The system emerged from Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky's work running design sprints at Google Ventures, where they learned to control "how everything happens" during focused work periods. They found that the tactics working well in structured sprints could be applied to daily life.

The core insight is that most productivity advice fails because it accepts the default environment of constant busyness and distraction. Make Time works by redesigning those defaults around one key principle: if you can protect time for one meaningful thing each day, you'll feel satisfied—even if everything else is a mess.

## How It Works

The system has four interconnected parts:

### 1. Highlight
Start each day by choosing one thing you want to be the highlight. Ask: "If someone asks me at the end of today what the highlight of my day was, what do I want to say?" This becomes your anchor.

Choose based on:
- **Urgency**: What absolutely has to happen today?
- **Satisfaction**: What would feel most meaningful to accomplish?
- **Joy**: What would bring the most happiness?

### 2. Laser
Create barriers to distraction so you can focus on your highlight. The principle is that willpower will never win against infinite pools of content—you need environmental changes. This includes removing apps, logging out of accounts, blocking time on your calendar, and creating physical distance from distractions.

### 3. Energize
Have the right energy when your highlight time arrives. Your brain and body are connected—sleep, food, exercise, and social interaction all affect your ability to focus. Apply the same experimental mindset to these areas.

### 4. Reflect
At the end of each day, look back with curiosity, not judgment. Did your highlight happen? What worked or didn't? This creates a feedback loop for continuous improvement and treats each day as an experiment you can learn from.

## How to Apply It

1. **Morning**: Write your highlight on a sticky note and place it somewhere visible
2. **Schedule**: Block 60-90 minutes on your calendar for your highlight at your peak energy time
3. **Environment**: Remove or create barriers to your biggest distractions
4. **Execute**: When highlight time comes, you've cleared the path to focus
5. **Evening**: Reflect on what happened—what helped, what got in the way?

Start with just the highlight. If you do nothing else, picking one meaningful thing each day and writing it down will shift how you experience your time.

## When to Use It

- When you feel overwhelmed by email, meetings, and small tasks
- When important projects keep getting pushed aside
- When you feel busy but not satisfied at the end of days
- When you want a sustainable system rather than quick productivity hacks
- When you need a framework that works with life changes (kids, new jobs, etc.)
