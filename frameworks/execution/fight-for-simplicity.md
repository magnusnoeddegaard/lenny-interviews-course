# Fight for Simplicity

> "Simplicity is worth fighting for. That's thing number one. But the other one is that it requires fighting for. It does not happen, and it will be a fight, because the universe is working against you." - Dharmesh Shah

## What It Is

Fight for Simplicity is HubSpot's cultural principle that explicitly acknowledges simplicity doesn't happen naturally—it requires active, continuous effort. The phrase captures two truths: simplicity matters enough to fight for, AND achieving it requires a fight.

This framework operationalizes the battle against entropy (the Second Law of Business) through practical mechanisms and systems that constrain complexity.

## How It Works

**The "One In, One Out" Product Rule**

In HubSpot's early years, every time you added what they called a "knob or dial" (a feature), you had to remove one somewhere else. It's a coarse measurement—not every checkbox is equivalent—but it's better than no constraint. The rule forces teams to think about cumulative complexity.

**Third-Order Thinking on Features**

Most people evaluate features based on:
- First-order: Cost of implementation
- Second-order: Maintenance cost over time

But the most important cost is third-order: the dimensional complexity added to the business. When you go from product one to product two:
- Every engineer hire requires deciding which product they work on
- Every marketing campaign requires allocation between products
- Every metric chart now needs to be sliced by product
- Every decision gains a new dimension

This dimensional complexity is rarely planned for but always arrives.

**Binary Over Gradated Decisions**

"Everything or nothing is much simpler." HubSpot's transparency policy: everyone sees all information, period. This eliminates endless debates about who gets access to what. When deciding between options, prefer binary choices that eliminate ongoing judgment calls.

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit complexity additions** - For any new feature, product, or process, explicitly ask: "What dimensional complexity does this add to every future decision?"

2. **Implement constraints** - Build systems with guardrails, not just cultural values. "A reasonably well-done system will outbeat any other mechanism."

3. **Start simple, scale complexity only when broken** - Keep the simple approach until it demonstrably fails. HubSpot's seat lottery worked for hundreds of people.

4. **Challenge complexity defaults** - The conventional approach often includes unnecessary complexity. Test if simpler works. (Can we have 1,000 insiders? Turns out, yes.)

5. **Make simplicity cultural** - State it explicitly as a value. Talk about it at all-hands. Call out when complexity is sneaking in.

## When to Use It

- Product planning and roadmap discussions
- Process design and policy creation
- Organization design decisions
- Any situation where "let's just add one more thing" pressure exists
- When things feel slow or bureaucratic
