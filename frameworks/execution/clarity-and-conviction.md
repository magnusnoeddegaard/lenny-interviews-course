# Clarity and Conviction

> "Product management is clarity and conviction. That's what product management is. You bring clarity and you have conviction." - Ebi Atawodi

## What It Is

A simple but profound definition of product management craft. Every activity a PM does can be understood through the lens of either bringing clarity (removing ambiguity, simplifying complexity, aligning understanding) or demonstrating conviction (having a strong point of view about where to go and committing to it).

This framework helps PMs understand what they're actually trying to achieve and provides a filter for evaluating their effectiveness.

## How It Works

### Clarity

**Definition**: Transparency and simplicity of understanding. Sifting out everything that's polluting the core thing.

Clarity manifests in:
- **Problem definition** - Everyone understands what problem we're solving
- **Communication** - Emails, docs, presentations that are crisp and actionable
- **Prioritization** - Clear reasons for what we're doing and not doing
- **Alignment** - The whole team can articulate the same top problems and goals

**The Email Test**: When you send an email, the recipient should immediately know: Is this an FYI? Is there a problem? Do you need help? If they can't tell, you haven't brought clarity.

### Conviction

**Definition**: A feeling of what you think the way the world should be. Not certainty, not absolute, not perfect - but a feeling of what is right.

Conviction manifests in:
- **Vision** - A clear picture of the future you're working toward
- **Decisions** - Taking a stand rather than presenting endless options
- **Product sense** - The intuition built from exposure to products
- **Commitment** - Backing your choice even when uncertain

**The Options Test**: When someone presents "here are options A and B with pros and cons" without a recommendation, they don't have conviction. The work isn't done.

## How to Apply It

### Building Clarity

1. **Write things down** - Documents force precision. "Clarity comes when you write."

2. **Use structured frameworks** - Insights → Strategy → Big Rocks creates a clear narrative

3. **Force prioritization** - If you have more than 3-5 priorities, you haven't achieved clarity

4. **Test understanding** - Ask your team the top problems. If answers differ, more clarity work is needed.

5. **Strip away complexity** - What's the one thing? What's the headline? What's the core?

### Building Conviction

1. **Do the understand work** - Use products, talk to users, analyze data until you have a feeling

2. **Make a recommendation** - Don't just present options. Say which one you believe in.

3. **Identify your uncertainty** - Be honest about what would increase your confidence

4. **Stress test with constraints** - "If you could only build one thing, what would it be?"

5. **Commit to learning** - Conviction isn't about being right; it's about having a hypothesis worth testing

## When to Use It

- When evaluating your own PM effectiveness
- When coaching or developing other PMs
- When something feels off about how a team is working
- When making hiring decisions about PM candidates
- When deciding what skills to invest in developing

## Red Flags

**Lack of Clarity**:
- Rambling when asked about top problems
- Long emails with no clear ask
- "It depends" as a default answer
- Endless meetings without decisions

**Lack of Conviction**:
- "Here are the options, you decide"
- Waiting for more research before forming a view
- Changing direction with every new input
- Consensus-seeking without a perspective

## The Interplay

Clarity without conviction is analysis paralysis - you understand everything but don't know where to go.

Conviction without clarity is reckless confidence - you know where to go but can't explain why or bring others along.

The best PMs have both: they can explain the situation with clarity AND they have a strong point of view about what to do.
