# Cycles Not Sprints

> "I don't like the word sprint because how do you feel after a sprint? Exhausted. You can't layer that back to back to back to back. You cannot sprint back to back to back to back in life. And you can't do it at work. People do it at work, but I don't think it actually works." - Jason Fried

## What It Is

Cycles Not Sprints is a philosophical shift in how to think about development timeboxes. While sprints imply maximum intensity for short bursts, cycles suggest sustainable, repeating rhythms with intentional recovery built in.

The distinction matters because language shapes behavior. "Sprint" suggests going all-out, which is fine for a one-time effort but unsustainable as a permanent way of working. Teams doing two-week sprints back-to-back indefinitely aren't really sprinting—they're running a marathon at sprint pace, which is a recipe for burnout.

Cycles, by contrast, acknowledge that work comes in waves. There's focused production time, then there's recovery time, then the cycle repeats. Just like seasons in nature or workout-recovery patterns in fitness, sustainable performance requires rhythm.

## How It Works

**Sprint Model** (what most teams do):
- 2-week intense periods
- Back-to-back, no break
- Same intensity expected every sprint
- Burnout accumulates over time
- "Sprint" implies urgency every time

**Cycle Model** (the alternative):
- 6-week production periods
- 2-week cool-down between cycles
- Sustainable pace throughout
- Recovery built into the system
- "Cycle" implies repetition and rhythm

**Why 6 Weeks?**:
- Long enough to build something meaningful
- Short enough to avoid project sprawl
- Creates natural checkpoints for direction changes
- Fits well with quarterly planning

## How to Apply It

1. **Change the language**: Stop calling timeboxes "sprints." The word matters. Use "cycle" or another term that implies sustainability.

2. **Extend the duration**: Two weeks is often too short for meaningful work. Consider four to six weeks as the active period.

3. **Build in recovery**: Add explicit cool-down time between cycles. Don't just chain intense periods together.

4. **Set sustainable expectations**: A cycle isn't about maximum intensity. It's about focused, professional work at a pace you could maintain indefinitely.

5. **Use cycles for fresh starts**: Each cycle is an opportunity to reconsider priorities, not just continue the backlog.

6. **Plan around cycles**: Shape upcoming work during cool-downs so cycles can start clean.

## When to Use It

- Teams experiencing sprint fatigue or burnout
- Organizations where "sprinting" has become meaningless due to overuse
- Development teams wanting a more sustainable rhythm
- When two-week sprints feel too short for meaningful work
- Any team that runs back-to-back intensive periods indefinitely
