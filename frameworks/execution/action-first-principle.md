# Action First Principle

> "Remember, action is the first principle of business. You do stuff and my book is very oriented towards that. The idea was not to tell you what to do, but to give you guideposts while you're on that journey." - Hamilton Helmer

## What It Is

The Action First Principle holds that execution precedes strategy, not the reverse. Even Hamilton Helmer—author of the most respected strategy book in Silicon Valley—emphasizes that doing things matters more than planning them. Strategy is a tool for navigating while in motion, not a prerequisite for starting.

This principle counters the tendency to over-plan and under-execute, especially common among analytically-minded founders who want to have everything figured out before beginning.

## How It Works

### Strategy as Navigation, Not Prescription
Helmer's 7 Powers framework isn't meant to be a planning document you complete before starting. It's meant to be:
- A set of guideposts while you're already moving
- A way to evaluate what you're learning
- A lens for understanding emerging opportunities

"The idea was not to tell you what to do, but to give you guideposts while you're on that journey."

### The Doing Reveals the Path
Business is full of surprises that can only be discovered through action:
- Customer reactions you couldn't predict
- Market dynamics you couldn't model
- Opportunities you couldn't foresee

"Life is full of surprises. You'll end up in a place you didn't expect."

### Strategy Emerges from Action
The best strategic insights often come from being in the arena:
- Ideas about transformation "bubble up from down below"
- Product managers "really have the knowledge of what the heck's going on"
- Learning happens through "doing stuff"

## How to Apply It

1. **Start before you're ready** - Don't wait for perfect strategy
   - Your initial plan will be wrong anyway
   - Real information comes from real activity

2. **Use strategy as a lens, not a plan** - While doing:
   - Ask: "What does this tell us about power?"
   - Ask: "Are we tilting toward defensibility?"
   - Ask: "What's emerging that we didn't expect?"

3. **Let action inform strategy** - Learn, then adjust:
   - What's working better than expected?
   - What competitive dynamics are we discovering?
   - What power opportunities are appearing?

4. **Avoid analysis paralysis** - Common traps:
   - Waiting for certainty that will never come
   - Over-investing in strategic planning documents
   - Studying theory without practicing

5. **Stay in motion** - Strategy serves execution:
   - Keep building, shipping, talking to customers
   - Update your strategic understanding continuously
   - Let emerging data guide strategic choices

## The Paradox

Helmer's insight is paradoxical: the author of the definitive strategy book says action matters most. But this makes sense:
- Strategy is descriptive (what patterns lead to success)
- Execution is generative (what creates opportunities)
- You need both, but action comes first

"People that are enthused about it, I encourage you to do stuff. That's where it all starts and I can think about it and maybe help a little bit, but it's mostly doing stuff."

## When to Use It

- Feeling paralyzed by strategic decisions
- Spending more time planning than building
- Waiting for "the right strategy" before acting
- Wanting everything figured out before starting
- Over-indexing on theoretical frameworks
