# Leave Nothing to Chance

> "There will never be a time like this. I've never seen anything like it, I doubt I'll ever feel anything like this in business again where there's unlimited demand... Leave nothing to chance. How do you make sure that three months from now, six months, you have no regrets?" - Garrett Lord

## What It Is

Leave Nothing to Chance is an operating philosophy for rare moments when market conditions create extraordinary opportunity. During these windows—which may only happen once in a career—the appropriate response is maximum intensity execution where nothing is left on the table.

The framework recognizes that most of business is about sustainable pacing and prioritization. But occasionally, conditions align (unlimited demand, clear path to capture, time-limited window) where the only acceptable approach is all-out effort with zero regret.

## How It Works

**Recognize the Moment**: Not every opportunity warrants this intensity. The trigger is a rare confluence: unlimited demand, clear competitive advantage, time-limited window. When you're bottlenecked only on execution and the opportunity is fleeting, this is the moment.

**Countdown Mentality**: The Handshake team literally drew the number of days in the year on the whiteboard, counting down the window of opportunity. This visual reminder keeps urgency front of mind when fatigue sets in.

**No Regrets Test**: Every decision is filtered through: "Will I regret not doing this three to six months from now?" If the answer is yes, do it—get on the plane, make the late-night push, check the data again.

**Celebrate Intensely**: High intensity is only sustainable with high celebration. Recognize people putting up points. Make the environment fun despite the intensity. Flat structures and direct recognition keep energy high.

## How to Apply It

1. **Honestly assess whether this is a "leave nothing to chance" moment** - Most opportunities don't qualify. Reserve this intensity for genuine once-in-a-career windows.

2. **Make the timeline visible** - Put the countdown somewhere everyone can see it. Make the finite nature of the opportunity tangible.

3. **Apply the regret filter** - Before deprioritizing anything, ask: "Will I regret not doing this in six months?" If yes, find a way to do it.

4. **Get on the plane** - Literally. When customers or opportunities require in-person presence, go. Don't optimize for efficiency over relationship.

5. **Check the data again** - When quality matters, verify obsessively. The difference between 99% confident and 100% confident can be enormous.

## When to Use It

- When market conditions create genuine unlimited demand for what you offer
- When the window of opportunity is demonstrably time-limited
- When you're bottlenecked purely on execution, not strategy
- When failure to capture means watching competitors take what could have been yours

## When NOT to Use It

- For normal business operations (this isn't sustainable)
- When the "opportunity" is actually just anxiety or FOMO
- When you haven't validated that demand is real
- When the intensity would burn out the team for no lasting gain

## Example

Handshake AI during their first year:

- CEO working over Christmas and New Year flying to meet potential customers
- Team members regularly working 2-3 AM nights
- Office five days a week plus weekends
- 12 people starting in a single week to meet scaling needs
- Drawings on whiteboard counting down days of opportunity

Result: Zero to $50M ARR in four months, trajectory to exceed a decade-old business within two years.
