# Radical Focus / OKRs

> "OKRs are more of a vitamin, they're not a medicine. If you take OKRs and you're like, 'Oh, this will fix everything that's wrong with you.' No, that's not going to happen. It's just going to reveal everything that's wrong with your company." - Christina Wodtke

## What It Is

OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are a goal-setting framework that helps organizations focus on what actually matters and make sure they don't forget in the chaos of everyday life. The system creates alignment across the company, establishes a cadence of progress, and builds a learning cycle through regular retrospectives.

The key insight is that OKRs aren't a medicine that fixes broken companies—they're a vitamin that supercharges healthy ones. Companies that succeed with OKRs already have their fundamentals in place: strategy, empowered teams, and psychological safety.

The atomic unit of an OKR isn't the objective or key result itself—it's the answer to one simple question: "What am I doing this week to get closer to our goals?"

## How It Works

**The Structure:**
- **Objective**: An inspiring, qualitative goal for the quarter that makes you want to get out of bed. It should be motivating but not ridiculous. Avoid making it too fluffy (meaningless) or too boring (just shipping something).
- **Key Results**: 2-3 measurable outcomes that answer "How do we know we succeeded?" These triangulate success with:
  - One hardcore number (revenue, users, etc.)
  - One quality measure (delight, NPS, etc.)
  - One business metric (often with a dollar sign)

**The Hierarchy:**
1. **Mission**: What you're trying to achieve over 5+ years
2. **Strategy**: Your hypothesis about how to win in the market
3. **Quarterly OKRs**: What specifically happens this quarter
4. **Weekly Commitments**: What you're doing this week to advance the OKRs

**The Cadence:**
- Quarters are "long enough to get something done and short enough to not forget what you did"
- Weekly check-ins keep the OKRs top of mind
- End-of-quarter grading creates a learning cycle

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with mission and strategy** - OKRs without strategy are directionless. Answer: Why does this company exist? What's our hypothesis for winning?

2. **Set one inspiring objective per quarter** - Ask what needs to happen this quarter to move toward your strategy. Frame it as something worth getting excited about.

3. **Define 2-3 key results** - Spend 10 minutes brainstorming every possible way to measure success. The weird ideas that come after you run out of obvious ones often contain the best insights.

4. **Establish the weekly rhythm**:
   - **Monday**: Commit to what you'll do this week toward the OKRs
   - **Friday**: Celebrate wins across the company

5. **Keep status emails short** - Three P1s maximum, with what you did last week and what you're doing next week. Learning happens when you note what stopped you.

6. **Grade at quarter end** - Focus on retrospective learning, not precise measurement. Ask: Why 80%? What got in our way? What should we try next?

7. **Pilot with your best team first** - They'll figure out how to make it work in your culture, then you can scale.

## When to Use It

**Use OKRs when:**
- You have a strategy but struggle to execute against it
- Teams are spreading too thin across too many initiatives
- You need alignment across the organization
- You want to build a learning culture with regular reflection

**Don't use OKRs when:**
- Your company lacks psychological safety
- You have no strategy to connect OKRs to
- You're trying to "fix" a broken team or company
- You're not willing to commit to the weekly cadence

## Common Pitfalls

- **Tasks instead of outcomes** - Key results should be outcomes, not activities
- **Too many OKRs** - One objective with 2-3 key results is enough
- **Review meetings in the weeds** - CEOs shouldn't be reviewing IC tasks
- **Approval bottleneck** - Use peer review instead of top-down approval
- **Obsessing over precise measurement** - Focus on learning, not perfect numbers
