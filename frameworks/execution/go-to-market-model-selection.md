# Go-to-Market Model Selection

> "I think there's a small handful of go-to-market models that have been proven to work, and I think it's important to choose the right one for the product category you're going after." - Bret Taylor

## What It Is

A framework for selecting the appropriate go-to-market strategy based on the fundamental dynamics of your market—specifically, who uses your product versus who buys it, and the decision-making latitude of your target user.

Many startups fail not because of product issues, but because they chose a go-to-market model that doesn't match their market dynamics. Each model has specific requirements, and choosing wrong means fighting the structure of your market.

## The Three Models

### 1. Developer-Led

**How it works**: Appeal to individual engineers within companies who have autonomy to adopt tools, then expand from there.

**Famous examples**: Stripe, Twilio

**Requirements**:
- Product is a platform or developer tool
- Users (developers) have significant latitude to choose solutions
- Technical evaluation can happen without procurement

**Works well for**:
- Platform products
- Startups selling to other startups
- Infrastructure and tooling

**Doesn't work for**:
- Line of business applications (marketing, HR, finance)
- Products where the buyer isn't technical
- Markets where developers don't control purchasing

### 2. Product-Led Growth (PLG)

**How it works**: Users sign up from the website, get trials, and can often purchase with a credit card. Product drives adoption.

**Requirements**:
- **User = Buyer** (same person)
- Low friction to try and evaluate

**Works well for**:
- Small business software (sole proprietors do everything)
- Products like Shopify where the merchant is both user and buyer
- Tools where individuals control their own purchasing

**Doesn't work for**:
- Products where user ≠ buyer
- Example: Expense reporting software—employees use it, but finance department buys it
- "Having sign up and buy with your credit card doesn't make sense because the person using is not the person with the credit card"

### 3. Direct Sales

**How it works**: Dedicated sales team engages with enterprise buyers through traditional sales motions.

**Lineage**: Oracle → SAP, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Adobe

**Requirements**:
- Large enough deal sizes to support sales motion
- Complex purchasing decisions
- Buyer and user may be different people

**Works well for**:
- Enterprise software
- Products sold to lines of business
- Complex, multi-stakeholder decisions

**Recent trend**: Direct sales "had gone a little bit out of fashion" as PLG became popular, but is "coming back in fashion" especially in AI because:
- Many AI opportunities have user ≠ buyer dynamics
- Requires engaging with the actual decision maker

## How to Apply It

**Step 1: Map your buyer and user**

| Question | Implications |
|----------|-------------|
| Who uses the product day-to-day? | This is your user |
| Who has budget authority? | This is your buyer |
| Are they the same person? | Determines viable models |

**Step 2: Assess user latitude**

- Can users adopt without procurement approval?
- Do they have credit card authority?
- Is technical evaluation possible without sales engagement?

**Step 3: Match to model**

| Situation | Recommended Model |
|-----------|------------------|
| Technical users with adoption latitude | Developer-led |
| User = buyer, can self-serve | PLG |
| User ≠ buyer, complex decisions | Direct sales |

**Step 4: Be first-principles**

Don't choose based on what's popular or what you're comfortable with:
- "Don't choose a go-to-market motion without thinking through what is the process of purchasing this software"
- If you're a technical founder uncomfortable with sales, that doesn't mean PLG is right for your market

## Common Mistake

Founders choose go-to-market models based on comfort, not market fit:

> "Candidly, I think a lot of companies should leverage direct sales more than they do. And even though because of the sometimes justified reputation of the quality of products of some of these direct sales companies, it had gotten a bad name."

Technical founders often avoid direct sales because it feels uncomfortable or "enterprise-y," but if your buyer isn't your user, PLG simply won't work.
