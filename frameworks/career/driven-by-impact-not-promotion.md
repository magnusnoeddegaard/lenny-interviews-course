# Driven by Impact Not Promotion

> "If you forget about everything else, forget about politics, forget about promotion or having a bigger org or whatever, if you simply wake up every day trying to have the biggest impact you can... that's a really good guiding light." - Ian McAllister

## What It Is

Driven by Impact Not Promotion is a mindset framework for career development that inverts conventional career thinking. Instead of working backwards from "how do I get promoted?" and optimizing for visibility, politics, or title accumulation, you focus entirely on having maximum impact every single day.

Ian McAllister describes how during his first 10 years at Amazon, he was "just hungry to have an impact"—taking his business and growing it as fast as possible. He wasn't strategizing about promotions or bringing it up with his manager. The result? He was promoted multiple times anyway.

The counterintuitive truth: the surest path to promotion is to stop thinking about promotion and focus relentlessly on impact.

## How It Works

**The Impact-First Approach:**
1. Identify the metric or outcome that defines success for your business
2. Wake up every day asking: "How can I make that number go up and to the right?"
3. Marshal your team's resources toward the highest-leverage opportunities
4. Repeat indefinitely

**What This Means in Practice:**
- Choosing projects based on business impact, not visibility
- Spending energy on execution rather than politics
- Taking on problems that matter, even if they're not glamorous
- Being a good steward of resources regardless of recognition

**The Flywheel Effect:**
Impact → Trust → Resources → Larger Scope → More Impact → Faster Promotion

When you focus on impact, you build trust. Trust gives you more resources. More resources let you tackle bigger challenges. Bigger challenges create more impact. This eventually leads to promotion—but as a byproduct, not a goal.

## How to Apply It

1. **Find Your Fitness Function**: What's the one metric that best captures success for your product or business? Make that your North Star.

2. **Audit Your Time**: Are you spending time on activities that drive impact, or activities that you think will help you get promoted?

3. **Stop Talking About Promotion**: Don't bring up promotion in 1:1s. Talk about the work, the problems, the opportunities.

4. **Compare Horizontally**: Look at people at your level who have the most impact. What are they doing differently?

5. **Play the Long Game**: This approach works over years, not months. Trust the compound effect.

## When to Use It

- Every day (this is a mindset, not a situational framework)
- When you feel frustrated about career progress
- When tempted to work on "visible" projects over impactful ones
- When coaching or mentoring others on career development
- When evaluating job opportunities (will you have impact?)

## Common Pitfalls

**"But I need to play politics to survive"**
In healthy organizations, sustained impact wins. If politics truly trumps impact where you work, consider whether you're at the right company.

**"Impact is hard to measure in my role"**
Find the closest proxy. Even in ambiguous roles, there's usually something that indicates whether you're moving the needle.

**"What if my manager doesn't see my impact?"**
This is a communication problem, not an impact problem. Make your impact visible through updates, demos, and metrics—but do this as a byproduct of the work, not the goal.
