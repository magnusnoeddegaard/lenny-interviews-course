# When You Got Nothing to Do, Sweep

> "When you've got nothing to do, sweep. Never sit around." - Fred (Kayvon Beykpour's first boss)

## What It Is

"When You Got Nothing to Do, Sweep" is a work ethic principle that shaped Kayvon Beykpour's entire career. The lesson came from his first job at age 14, doing maintenance on fire extinguishers. After completing his assigned task, he sat in the truck waiting. His boss Fred noticed and said: "When you've got nothing to do, sweep. Never sit around."

The insight is deceptively simple: there's always something productive you can do. The choice to sit idle is a choice—and it's the wrong one. In any role, at any level, there are improvements to make, skills to develop, problems to anticipate, or messes to clean up.

This isn't about grinding yourself into exhaustion. It's about the orientation: proactive contribution versus passive waiting for instructions.

## How It Works

**The Default State Shift**:
Most people's default when a task is done is to wait for the next assignment. "Sweep" makes the default finding the next thing yourself.

**Why It Compounds**:
- You notice problems others miss
- You build skills through extra reps
- Leaders trust you with more because you seek it
- You move from follower to leader naturally

**What "Sweeping" Looks Like at Different Levels**:
- **IC**: Document what you learned, help a teammate, clean up code, prep for the next sprint
- **Manager**: Check in on struggling projects, unblock teams, anticipate next quarter's challenges
- **Executive**: Build relationships, scout market changes, mentor rising leaders, think about long-term strategy

**The Meta-Lesson**:
Fred wasn't just teaching productivity—he was teaching that agency and contribution are choices you make moment by moment.

## How to Apply It

1. **Kill waiting time** - When a meeting ends early, a task finishes ahead of schedule, or you're blocked on something—immediately ask: "What's my sweep?"

2. **Keep a sweep list** - Maintain a running list of low-priority but valuable tasks you can pick up in empty moments: documentation, code cleanup, learning, relationship-building.

3. **Notice the dust** - Actively look for problems that aren't assigned to anyone. Organizational "dust" accumulates in the gaps between roles.

4. **Make it visible** - When you complete your main work and tackle something extra, let relevant people know. This builds trust and often surfaces that the "extra" was actually important.

5. **Teach others to sweep** - Share this principle with your team. An organization where everyone sweeps operates at a higher level.

## When to Use It

- When you finish a task and feel the pull to check email/slack passively
- When waiting for a decision or blocker
- When onboarding (before you have a full workload)
- When between projects
- When you're new to a role and want to build credibility quickly

## Cautions

This principle pairs well with rest ethic and sustainable pace:
- **Sweep** when you have capacity—don't use it to justify overwork
- **Rest** when you need rest—idleness for recovery is different from idleness from passivity
- Know the difference between productive sweeping and busy-work that just feels productive
