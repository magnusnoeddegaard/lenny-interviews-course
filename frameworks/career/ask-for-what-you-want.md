# Ask for What You Want

> "If we're asking for it regularly, if we're listening to the response, we're expecting the no's we get from the world, then we can get the sense of, 'Yeah, I'm honoring what's important to me. I'm honoring the world's response and I'm moving forward towards what I want.'" - Kenneth Berger

## What It Is

Ask for What You Want is a three-step framework for pursuing your goals while staying in integrity with yourself and others. The core insight is that most people either don't ask for what they want (people pleasers) or demand it without respecting others (control freaks)—both approaches lead to frustration, stuckness, and damaged relationships.

The framework recognizes that we can't guarantee outcomes, but we can ensure we're genuinely pursuing what matters to us while respecting others' autonomy. Not asking for what you want isn't playing it safe—it's living out of integrity with yourself and almost guaranteeing you won't get what you want.

## How It Works

The framework has three steps:

### Step 1: Articulate What You Want

First, get clear on what you actually want. This is harder than it sounds because many people either:
- **Suppress their desires** - "I'm fine" is a common deflection that masks real wants
- **Articulate unrealistic goals** - Entitled demands like "everyone should obey me"

To find the middle ground, use complaints as inspiration (see Dream Behind the Complaint). Check whether your articulated want:
- Feels inspiring and motivating
- Is credible and possible
- Is something you can say out loud without embarrassment

### Step 2: Ask Intentionally

Most people get stuck in patterns:
- **People pleasers** hope others will read their minds rather than asking
- **Control freaks** order people around rather than making genuine requests

Asking intentionally means:
- Combining clarity with humility: "I really disagree with this decision. I know it's not my call, but it's important to me that you know. Would you be willing to reconsider?"
- Not using data as a crutch—your opinion matters because of your relationships and expertise
- Being willing to risk some discomfort rather than staying safe and silent

### Step 3: Accept the Response

This is the trickiest step. You need to:
- **Hear no as data, not defeat** - Most responses are no, and that's fine
- **Avoid over-accepting** - A no from this person now doesn't mean no forever
- **Avoid under-accepting** - Don't skip over no because it's inconvenient

Accepting the response requires emotional regulation—the no itself is just data for your next ask.

## How to Apply It

1. **Check for integrity**: Ask yourself if there's something you keep thinking about wanting to say but haven't. If so, you're probably out of integrity.

2. **Use complaints as raw material**: When you find yourself complaining, identify the implied dream behind the complaint.

3. **Practice humble clarity**: State what you want clearly while acknowledging you can't control the outcome: "This is what I think, and I hope that's enough on its own."

4. **Expect no**: Reframe "no" as valuable data that helps you figure out what to try next.

5. **Focus on iteration**: Each ask is an experiment. Learn from the response and try again.

## When to Use It

Use this framework when you:
- Feel stuck in the same place week after week
- Experience recurring interpersonal conflict
- Sense that stakes feel unusually high
- Notice you're focused more on fear than on goals
- Haven't fully expressed yourself in a situation that matters

## Common Pitfalls

- **Using data as a crutch**: Your gut opinion is valid data too—don't wait for perfect evidence
- **Fearing any discomfort**: You can't guarantee no one will ever be upset
- **Confusing discipline with motivation**: Shouting at yourself doesn't create sustainable change—vision does
- **Blaming others when you haven't asked**: If you haven't articulated what you want, you can't be surprised when you don't get it
