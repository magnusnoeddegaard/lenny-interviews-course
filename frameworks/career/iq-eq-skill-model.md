# IQ-EQ Skill Development Model

> "What I've seen in my career is that early on, I leaned more into the hard skills, the IQ stuff. That was what was most helpful to me. And then later on, I spent more time getting better at the EQ skills... it's much harder to learn these skills than the IQ stuff." - Jules Walter

## What It Is

The IQ-EQ Skill Development Model is a framework for understanding the two fundamentally different types of skills PMs need to develop, and why they require different approaches to learning.

**IQ Skills** (Hard Skills): Execution, product sense, strategy, analytics, technical knowledge
- Learn relatively fast (3-6 months to see clear progress)
- Can be taught through frameworks and mental models
- Knowledge transfers well between people
- Progress is measurable and visible

**EQ Skills** (Soft Skills): Communication, leadership, management, influence, self-awareness
- Learn slowly (years of continuous work)
- Highly personal—what you need to work on differs from others
- Requires ongoing practice (muscles atrophy without use)
- Progress is less linear and harder to measure

Jules Walter found that early in his career, IQ skills drove the most impact. As he became more senior with larger scope, EQ skills became the differentiator—and also the reason many PMs hit "terminal levels."

## How It Works

### The Two Buckets

**IQ Skills (Intellectual / Hard Skills)**

| Skill | What It Means | How to Learn |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Execution | Shipping products, running experiments, managing projects | Study artifacts, watch great PMs, practice |
| Product Sense | Intuition for good product decisions | Analyze products, read case studies, iterate |
| Strategy | Setting direction, making tradeoffs | Study strategy docs, reverse engineer winners |
| Analytics | Using data to inform decisions | Practice with real data, learn frameworks |
| Interviewing | Passing PM interviews | Mock interviews (dozens of them) |

**EQ Skills (Emotional / Soft Skills)**

| Skill | What It Means | How to Learn |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Communication | Clarity, storytelling, adapting to audiences | Practice, feedback, writing regularly |
| Leadership | Driving initiatives across teams, inspiring others | Stretch assignments, coaching, reflection |
| Management | Developing people, building teams | Experience, mentorship, feedback |
| Influence | Getting buy-in without authority | Understand stakeholders, build relationships |
| Self-awareness | Knowing your patterns, triggers, strengths | Coaching, feedback, honest mentors |

### Why EQ Skills Are Harder

1. **Personal specificity**: What you need to work on is unique to you. "The EQ stuff... What you need to focus on is specific to you."

2. **Requires self-awareness**: You need to know what to work on before you can work on it. Most people have blind spots.

3. **Continuous practice**: "A lot of it is like lifting weights or building muscles; you have to do it every day or every week. And then if you stop doing it, over time you atrophy again."

4. **Harder to get feedback**: People are reluctant to give honest EQ feedback. "You won't get feedback after an interview at any company."

5. **Less visible progress**: You can't easily measure "I'm 20% better at communication."

### Career Progression Pattern

**Early Career (IC PM)**
- Focus: IQ skills
- Impact drivers: Execution, product sense, shipping
- Learning mode: Frameworks, artifacts, practice

**Mid Career (Senior PM)**
- Shift: EQ skills become more important
- Impact drivers: Communication, influence, collaboration
- Learning mode: Feedback, coaching, self-reflection

**Senior Career (Lead/Director+)**
- Focus: EQ skills dominate
- Impact drivers: Leadership, vision, organizational effectiveness
- Blocker: "Terminal levels" often due to EQ gaps

Jules notes: "A lot of people reach terminal levels in product because people are like, 'Oh, they lack emotional intelligence.' They say that in calibration rooms but not in your face."

## How to Apply It

### For IQ Skills

1. **Set concrete outcomes** - "Within 6 months, improve activation by X%"
2. **Study great examples** - Find the best artifacts at your company
3. **Reverse engineer** - Break down what makes them great
4. **Practice with real work** - Apply immediately to your projects
5. **Get feedback** - Compare your output to excellent examples

Timeline: 3-6 months of focused effort per skill

### For EQ Skills

1. **Get honest mirrors** - Find mentors/coaches who will tell you the truth
2. **Identify patterns** - Through feedback, understand your specific areas
3. **Focus on one thing** - Don't try to improve everything at once
4. **Practice continuously** - Build it into daily work
5. **Accept the long game** - "It was the most frustrating learning for me"

Timeline: Ongoing, years of continuous development

### Getting EQ Feedback

The challenge: People won't volunteer this feedback. Jules's approach:

1. **Make it safe** - "If you manage to get them to take the risk to give you the feedback, your answer has to be enthusiastically grateful."

2. **Ask specifically** - Not "how did I do?" but "I'm working on executive presence—did you see that?"

3. **Model vulnerability** - Give yourself critical feedback first, then ask if they agree

4. **Build trust over time** - The best feedback comes from long relationships

## When to Use It

- Planning your professional development focus
- Prioritizing which skills to invest in
- Understanding why certain skills feel harder to develop
- Diagnosing why career progression has stalled
- Structuring mentorship conversations

## The Listening Example

Jules shares that he's currently working on listening:

"I'm good at seeking information to solve a problem... However, there's also different listening patterns, one of which is you just create space for someone."

This illustrates the personal nature of EQ work—listening might feel trivial to someone else, but for Jules it's an edge he's deliberately developing.
