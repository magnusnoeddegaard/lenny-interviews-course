# Be Known for Something

> "I think it's really important to become really good at and also known for something... Find something that you can be really, really good at. And the reason I give that advice is because when you do that, you can crush the projects that you get because you're making a name for yourself, reputation, and then you are given more responsibility. People tend to flock and give responsibility to the people that are known for being excellent at something." - Jiaona Zhang

## What It Is

Be Known for Something is a career acceleration framework that emphasizes building a visible reputation for excellence in a specific domain. The key insight is that career advancement isn't just about doing good work—it's about being *known* for a particular strength that causes opportunities to flow to you.

This differs from generic advice about "building skills." The framework requires two components: actually being excellent at something AND having that excellence be recognized within your organization. One without the other limits your career trajectory.

JZ developed this framework through her own career progression from consulting to gaming to Dropbox to Airbnb, where she found that cultivating a visible specialty created a flywheel of increasingly important opportunities.

## How It Works

**The Two Components:**

1. **Being Good** - Having genuine skill and competence in an area
2. **Being Known** - Having a reputation within your organization (and beyond) for that skill

**Why Both Matter:**

- Good but not known = Underutilized, passed over for opportunities
- Known but not good = Quickly exposed when given responsibility
- Good AND known = Opportunities seek you out

**Types of Things to Be Known For:**

JZ suggests these domains where you can build a reputation:

1. **Complex launches** - Quarterbacking multi-stakeholder, go-to-market-heavy releases
2. **Technical complexity** - Working on deeply technical problems that intimidate others
3. **Regulatory complexity** - Navigating compliance, legal, and policy challenges
4. **Analytics** - Making data-driven decisions and finding insights others miss
5. **Execution** - Keeping many plates spinning and hitting deadlines reliably
6. **Zero-to-one** - Taking ambiguous ideas and making them real
7. **Turnarounds** - Fixing struggling products or teams

**The Flywheel Effect:**

When you're known for something:
1. You get assigned projects that leverage that strength
2. You crush those projects (because they play to your strength)
3. Your reputation grows
4. You get even more important projects
5. You gain more responsibility and accelerate your career

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your current strengths** - What do you do better than most of your peers? What comes naturally that others find hard?

2. **Pick one to double down on** - Don't try to be known for five things. Choose the strength most valued in your current context.

3. **Volunteer for relevant projects** - Actively seek opportunities to exercise and demonstrate your specialty

4. **Deliver exceptional results** - The reputation only works if you actually deliver when given the opportunity

5. **Make it visible** - Share learnings, write internal docs, present at team meetings. Excellence unobserved doesn't build reputation.

6. **Evolve over time** - Your "thing" may shift as you grow. JZ started with analytics, evolved to execution, and later flexed into leadership.

## When to Use It

- **Early career** - Establish your initial reputation and differentiation
- **New company** - Quickly signal your value by demonstrating a specialty
- **Seeking promotion** - Build the reputation that makes you the obvious choice
- **Career pivots** - Identify which existing strengths transfer to the new domain
- **Mentoring others** - Help direct reports identify and cultivate their "thing"

## JZ's Career Example

**Early Career (Gaming):**
- Came from consulting with no CS or design background
- Leaned into analytics as her differentiator
- Became known for data-driven decision making
- Discovered she was also excellent at execution

**Dropbox:**
- Brought her execution reputation
- Took on a complex launch with multiple platforms, third-party APIs, small team, tight deadline
- Delivered, which led to: "She can do hard things with small teams"
- Got increasingly important assignments

**Evolution to Leadership:**
- Recognized that "best executor" isn't what gives you responsibility as a leader
- Flexed her core strengths into new expressions
- At Airbnb and beyond, her "thing" evolved with her role
