# Dimensionality of Skills

> "If you take that as the model, you realize that none of these dimensions are you entirely. So I can make a comment like 'Lenny, your ax throwing really could use some improvement,' and ideally you're not like, 'Julie is saying I'm a bad person, my identity is at risk.'" - Julie Zhuo

## What It Is

A mental model for understanding yourself and receiving feedback without feeling your identity is threatened. The core insight is that every person can be evaluated across infinite dimensions - from ax throwing to podcast hosting to zero-to-one product work. Your profile across these dimensions is like a fingerprint: unique to you.

Because you exist across infinite dimensions, no single dimension represents who you truly are. This separation between specific skills and core identity makes it psychologically easier to:
- Receive critical feedback
- Acknowledge weaknesses
- Work on improvement areas
- Avoid defensive reactions

The framework also reveals that every strength is its own weakness, and every weakness is a strength. These are often flip sides of the same coin.

## How It Works

**Dimensional mapping:**
- You have some dimensions where you're in the top 1%
- Some where you're in the top 10%
- Some where you're average
- Some where you're below average
- This is true for everyone

**Strength-weakness duality:**
- Being thoughtful often means not being quick on your feet
- Being decisive often means not being reflective
- Being detail-oriented often means missing big picture
- The same quality manifests differently in different contexts

**Identity separation:**
- No single dimension defines your worth
- Feedback about a skill is not judgment of you as a person
- You are all dimensions combined, and none of them individually

## How to Apply It

1. **Map your dimensions** - Identify where you're strong (top 1-10%) and where you have room to grow. Be honest about the areas where you're average or below.

2. **Identify your strength-weakness pairs** - For each strength, ask: "What's the flip side of this?" Julie's example: being thoughtful meant she wasn't quick in dynamic discussions.

3. **Receive feedback as dimensional input** - When someone gives you critical feedback, mentally categorize it as input about one specific dimension, not about you as a whole person.

4. **Consider context when developing skills** - Ask whether improving a weak dimension serves your goals. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.

5. **Aim for mastery through balance** - True mastery is knowing when to lean into your natural tendencies versus when to stretch into the opposite behavior based on context.

## When to Use It

- When receiving performance feedback
- When feeling defensive about criticism
- When coaching others on receiving feedback
- When struggling with imposter syndrome
- When deciding which skills to develop
- When your identity feels threatened by a setback
