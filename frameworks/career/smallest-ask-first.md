# Smallest Ask First

> "What I do specifically is when I'm trying to build a mentor relationship, I should make the smallest ask possible, which is the opposite of what 95% of people do. 95% of people is like, 'Hey, I've never met you, but I heard your talk or I saw you on LinkedIn or whatever. Can we set up a call?' That's like a big ask." - Jules Walter

## What It Is

Smallest Ask First is a relationship-building technique for developing mentor connections with busy, accomplished people. Instead of starting with a meeting request (which feels like a commitment), you start with a question they can answer in two minutes via email.

The approach inverts the typical networking playbook. Most people try to "get time" with someone important. This approach focuses on getting value and proving you'll use it wisely—the relationship develops organically from there.

Jules Walter used this technique to build relationships with top product leaders like Bangaly Kaba, Bradley Horowitz, and Nikhyl Singhal, all while having no prior connection to them.

## How It Works

**The Three-Step Process**

1. **Smallest Ask**: Start with something they can answer in 2 minutes via email, tweet, or brief comment
2. **Circle Back**: Return later to show you applied their advice and got results
3. **Escalate Gradually**: Each subsequent ask can be slightly bigger, eventually leading to calls or ongoing mentorship

**What Makes a "Small" Ask**

- Can be answered in one email/message
- Requires minimal context to understand
- Has a specific, clear question
- Shows you've done homework already
- Isn't asking them to teach you from scratch

**Examples of Small Asks**

| Context | Small Ask |
|---------|-----------|
| After someone's talk | "You mentioned finding 'the heat' for products. Could you share an example of a product built this way?" |
| After reading their article | "In your piece on X, you mentioned Y framework. How would you apply that to Z specific situation?" |
| After an intro | "I'm facing [very specific challenge]. What's one thing you'd recommend I focus on?" |

**Examples of Too-Big Asks (Avoid)**

- "Can we hop on a call to discuss your career?"
- "I'd love to pick your brain about product management"
- "Can you mentor me?"
- "Could you introduce me to people in your network?"

## How to Apply It

### Initial Outreach

1. **Find a specific hook** - Something they said, wrote, or did that's relevant to a real challenge you face

2. **Frame a narrow question** - Not "tell me about growth" but "you mentioned X approach to activation—is there an example company that did this well?"

3. **Send via the right channel** - Email after events, Twitter for public figures, LinkedIn if that's your only option

4. **Make it effortless to respond** - They should be able to answer in 2-3 sentences

### The Critical Follow-Up

The key differentiator is what happens next:

1. **Apply their advice** - Actually use what they told you
2. **Circle back with results** - "I applied your framework to my situation. Here's what happened. Thank you!"
3. **Ask the next question** - Can be slightly bigger: "Now I'm facing this related challenge..."

Jules describes the pattern: "What I would do then later is maybe a month or two months later, reach out again for another problem and maybe I could say, 'Hey, this time it's a little bit more nuanced. Can we grab 15 minutes?' And the person says 'Yeah, sure.'"

### Ongoing Relationship

Over time, the relationship builds naturally:
- Quick email exchanges → occasional calls → regular mentorship
- Always continue showing you act on their advice
- Look for ways to be helpful back (see "Finding Ways to Help" section)

## Finding Ways to Help

Even very senior people need help. Jules asks mentors: "Hey, is there anything I can help you with? Anything top of mind for you?"

Examples of what busy leaders need:
- "I'd love to better understand how the team is really doing. Nobody tells me the truth."
- "I'm trying to hire for this role. Do you know anyone?"
- "I'm trying to understand [new trend]. Can you explain it?"

The John Lou story from Gibson Biddle illustrates this: Lou kept asking Biddle if he could help, and eventually built Biddle's website on Squarespace—creating a lasting relationship through a simple act of helpfulness.

## Maintaining the Relationship

Jules maintains mentor relationships by:

1. **Taking notes** during every conversation
2. **Referencing previous conversations** in follow-ups: "Remember when you mentioned X? I tried it and..."
3. **Asking about their life**: "How's your daughter? I know she was starting college."
4. **Making it feel like continuation**, not transaction

## When to Use It

- When you want to connect with someone accomplished who doesn't know you
- When reaching out after conferences, talks, or events
- When you need advice on a specific challenge
- When you want to build your mentor network organically

## Common Mistakes

1. **Starting too big** - Asking for a call before establishing any connection
2. **Being generic** - "I'd love to learn from you" vs. specific question
3. **Not following up** - Getting advice but never circling back
4. **Asking to be their mentee** - Let the relationship evolve naturally
5. **Only reaching out when you need something** - Maintain consistent connection
