# Mastery Before Management

> "Don't stop being a hands-on technical until you feel like it's in your bones. You feel like you've got mastery that you could... if you know a second language fluently or if you played an instrument really, really seriously for a long time, you'll be familiar with the... I haven't done that in a long time, but if I was to pick it up, it would be rusty, but I would get there pretty quickly." - Camille Fournier

## What It Is

Mastery Before Management is a heuristic for timing the transition from individual contributor to engineering management. The core insight is that you should develop deep technical mastery—skills that feel "in your bones"—before moving into management. Like fluency in a second language or expertise in a musical instrument, true technical mastery becomes a permanent foundation that you can always return to, even after years away from hands-on work.

The danger of moving too early is twofold: you lose the confidence that comes from knowing you could always go back, and you never develop the deep empathy for engineering work that makes you an effective technical leader.

## How It Works

**Signs you've reached mastery:**

- Your skills feel like second nature, "in your bones"
- You could pick them up again after years away, even if rusty
- You've developed a baseline that will stay with you
- You have internal confidence in your technical abilities
- You feel "done" with pure IC work and ready for new challenges

**The timeline heuristic:**

Based on Fournier's experience, expect roughly 10 years of serious coding:
- Could include undergraduate + graduate education (if coding-intensive)
- Plus 4-5 years of full-time professional work
- Or more if you started coding later

If you were programming a lot in high school and got an undergraduate degree, you might only need 4-5 years of post-graduation work. But for someone who started coding in college, expect a longer runway.

**Why this matters:**

1. **Confidence** - You won't feel anxious about being hands-off because you know you could return
2. **Empathy** - Deep experience helps you understand what makes a good engineer
3. **Credibility** - Teams respect leaders who have earned technical respect
4. **Resilience** - If management doesn't work out, you have a strong IC career to fall back on

**Special considerations for underrepresented groups:**

"If you happen to be a woman or otherwise underrepresented person in tech because people will tend to underestimate your technical abilities just unfortunately as a get-go. I also think it's particularly important to develop that internal confidence in your abilities before you make this scary leap."

## How to Apply It

**Questions to ask yourself:**

1. Do my technical skills feel like second nature?
2. Could I pick this up again after years away?
3. Am I still having fun writing code? (If so, don't rush)
4. Am I being pushed into management before I'm ready?
5. Do I have genuine mastery, or am I just frustrated with IC work?

**Red flags for moving too early:**

- Becoming a manager the first time somebody offers it
- Moving to management to escape IC challenges
- Being pushed toward "project management" which is a different (and often worse) path to leadership
- Having less than 4-5 years of serious coding experience

**How to stay technical after the transition:**

- Surround yourself with smart technical people and listen to them
- Stay curious about technical problems and stories
- Ask good questions rather than giving specific technical directives
- Stay in group chats and communities where engineers discuss technical work
- Don't try to tell ICs which library to use—that's annoying and usually wrong

## When to Use It

- When considering a move from IC to engineering management
- When evaluating if you're ready for technical leadership
- When someone offers you a management role
- When advising junior engineers on career timing
- When assessing why a technical leader lacks credibility
