# Interoception Training

> "Interoception is known as our sixth sense, and basically it's our ability to sense, track and feel our internal landscape." - Jonny Miller

## What It Is

Interoception is the ability to sense and interpret signals from inside your body—your breath, heartbeat, tension, emotions, and subtle sensations. Just as you can train your palette to distinguish flavors, you can train your interoceptive capacity to better detect and interpret internal states.

Research shows that higher interoception correlates with better decision-making (Wall Street traders with higher interoception made more money), while low interoception correlates with ADHD, PTSD, and burnout. Many high-achievers in tech are "numb from the neck down"—highly developed intellectually but disconnected from body wisdom.

## How It Works

**What You're Training**
- Breath awareness: Is it shallow or deep? Chest or belly? Fast or slow?
- Sensation tracking: Temperature, tension, tingling, heaviness
- Emotional awareness: What is the "flavor" or mood present?
- Somatic markers: Body signals that accompany decisions and intuitions

**Why It Matters**
- Early warning detection: Catch stress signals at the "feather" stage
- Better decisions: Access body-based wisdom and intuition
- Reduced reactivity: More space between stimulus and response
- Emotional intelligence: Understand what you're actually feeling

**Barriers to Interoception**
- Cortisol: Stress hormones act as numbing agents
- Habit: Years of ignoring body signals
- Dissociation: Using thoughts to avoid uncomfortable sensations
- Culture: Tech rewards "solving problems" in your head

## How to Apply It

1. **Daily APE practice** - Regular check-ins on Awareness, Posture, Emotion
2. **NSDR practice** - Guided body scan practice (15-20 minutes)
3. **Pre/post comparison** - Notice how you feel before and after practices
4. **Label sensations** - Put words to what you're experiencing
5. **Follow curiosity** - When something feels "off," investigate with curiosity

**The Body Scan Practice:**
- Lie down with an eye mask
- Follow a guided audio moving attention through your body
- Notice sensations without trying to change them
- Practice daily for best results

**Research Insight:**
"When there's cortisol present in our body, the cortisol basically acts as a numbing agent, so it's much harder to kind of tune into those sensations."

## When to Use It

- Daily as a foundational practice
- When making important decisions
- When something feels "off" but you can't identify why
- Before difficult conversations
- When recovering from burnout or trauma
- As part of a personal development practice
