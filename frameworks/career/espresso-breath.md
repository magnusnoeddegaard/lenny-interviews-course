# Espresso Breath

> "If Wim Hof is like Red Bull, this is kind of like a small coffee." - Jonny Miller

## What It Is

Espresso Breath (also known as Bellows Breath or Breath of Fire) is an activating breathing technique for creating energy and alertness. It's the opposite of calming breath practices—instead of emphasizing the exhale, you pump rapid exhales to activate the sympathetic nervous system.

The name comes from the effect: it gives you an energy boost similar to a small espresso, making it a useful alternative to afternoon caffeine.

## How It Works

**The Technique**
1. Sit up straight
2. Pump the breath rapidly from your lower belly
3. Emphasize the exhale through the nose
4. The inhale happens passively/automatically
5. Do 30 pumps per round
6. Rest with a full breath in, pause, then exhale
7. Repeat for 2-3 rounds

**The Science**
- Rapid breathing activates the sympathetic nervous system
- Increases alertness and energy
- Oxygenates the body
- Creates slight tingling sensation
- Opposite cascade of calming breath

**Important Notes**
- Keep breathing through the nose only (mouth can be too activating)
- Gentler than Wim Hof breathing
- Do not do while driving or operating machinery
- May cause lightheadedness—that's normal

## How to Apply It

1. **Replace afternoon coffee** - When energy dips between 1-3pm
2. **Before early meetings** - When you haven't quite woken up yet
3. **Stack with calming breath** - Espresso breath first to activate, then 4-4-8 to ground that energy

**The Stacking Technique:**
"Especially if you are meetings early in the morning and you haven't quite got going yet, you can do the espresso breath to begin with and that activates you. And then do some of the downshifting practices to kind of ground and stabilize that aliveness."

## When to Use It

- Morning meetings when you're not fully awake
- Afternoon energy dips
- Before workouts or physical activity
- When feeling lethargic or unmotivated
- As a caffeine alternative

## Contraindications

- Don't use if already anxious or activated
- Avoid before sleep
- Skip if you have high blood pressure (consult doctor)
- Not while driving
