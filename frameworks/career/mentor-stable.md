# Mentor Stable

> "It's actually better to have a stable of mentors. You want to have three or four. And ideally, what you do is you meet with each one of them once a month on a different Friday of the month." - Bangaly Kaba

## What It Is

The Mentor Stable is a framework for structuring mentorship relationships to maximize learning and career development. Instead of having a single mentor (which creates dependency and gaps), you build a "stable" of 3-4 mentors with complementary expertise, meeting each one monthly on a rotating schedule.

This ensures you always have someone to talk to, provides diverse perspectives, and creates resilience when any single mentor becomes unavailable.

## How It Works

### The Structure

- **Number**: 3-4 mentors
- **Frequency**: Meet each mentor once per month
- **Schedule**: Different Friday each month (Week 1: Mentor A, Week 2: Mentor B, etc.)
- **Result**: Someone to talk to every week

### Why This Beats Single-Mentor Relationships

**Single mentor risks**:
- If they're busy one month, you go two months without guidance
- Single perspective limits your thinking
- Their blind spots become your blind spots
- Dependency on one relationship

**Stable benefits**:
- If 1-2 cancel, you still have 2 people that month
- Diverse perspectives on the same problem
- Different expertise areas covered
- No single point of failure in your development

## How to Apply It

### Finding Mentors

1. **Don't Ask "Will You Be My Mentor?"**: This generic request often fails.

2. **Start with a Specific Challenge**: Tell people what you're working on or struggling with. Be specific: "I'm trying to figure out how to change the way this team operates because we need to shift from model A to model B."

3. **Ask for Referrals**: "Do you know someone who's really good at [specific skill] that I could talk to?"

4. **Use the Triad**: The best mentor connections come through referrals:
   - **You**: Person seeking guidance
   - **Recommender**: Person who sees the match
   - **Mentor**: Person with relevant expertise

   The recommender creates affinity by saying "There's common purpose here."

5. **Let Relationships Develop Naturally**: Initial conversations about specific problems can evolve into ongoing mentor relationships.

### Maintaining the Stable

1. **Diversify Expertise**: Each mentor should bring different strengths:
   - Strategic thinking
   - Execution and operations
   - Leadership and people management
   - Technical or domain expertise

2. **Keep Meetings Consistent**: Same day each month creates rhythm and commitment.

3. **Come Prepared**: Have specific topics, challenges, or decisions to discuss.

4. **Give Back**: Share what you're learning, make introductions, help where you can.

5. **Rotate Over Time**: As your career evolves, your mentor needs change. Add new mentors and gracefully transition out of relationships that are less relevant.

## When to Use It

- When building your career development infrastructure
- When you realize you're too dependent on one advisor
- When facing challenges that need diverse perspectives
- When your single mentor relationship becomes stale
- When moving into a new role or problem space

## Practical Tips

**Sample Mentor Stable**:
- **Mentor A** (Week 1): Former manager, strong on organizational politics and influence
- **Mentor B** (Week 2): Industry expert, deep domain knowledge
- **Mentor C** (Week 3): Peer at another company, fresh perspective on similar challenges
- **Mentor D** (Week 4): Executive, strategic thinking and big-picture guidance

**Conversation Starters**:
- "I'm facing this specific challenge: [describe]. How would you approach it?"
- "I'm considering [decision]. What am I not seeing?"
- "I observed [situation]. What does that tell me about the dynamics?"
- "I want to develop [skill]. What worked for you?"
