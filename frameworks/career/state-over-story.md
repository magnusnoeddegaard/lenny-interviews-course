# State Over Story

> "By learning how to pull on the levers of our physiology, we can rapidly change our state. And then from there, by changing our state, that impacts the thoughts and feelings that we have." - Jonny Miller

## What It Is

State Over Story is the principle that you should address anxiety and stress through your physiology (bottom-up) rather than through cognitive reframing (top-down). Most people try to calm themselves by changing their thoughts—telling themselves "it will be fine" or reframing situations positively. This approach is slow and often ineffective.

The insight is grounded in neuroscience: there are four times more neurons sending signals from the body to the brain than vice versa. Your body is constantly telling your brain how to feel. By changing your physical state first (through breath, posture, or movement), your thoughts and feelings naturally follow.

## How It Works

**The Top-Down Trap (Less Effective)**
- Trying to convince yourself not to be nervous
- Positive self-talk and affirmations
- Mindfulness meditation to observe thoughts
- Rational analysis of why you shouldn't worry

**The Bottom-Up Solution (More Effective)**
- Change your breathing pattern
- Adjust your posture
- Expand your visual awareness
- Move your body

**The Science**
- The insular cortex constantly monitors your breathing pattern
- Shallow, rapid, upper-chest breathing signals danger to your brain
- This triggers the endocrine system to release cortisol and adrenaline
- Your brain then finds reasons to justify feeling anxious
- Reversing the breath pattern reverses this cascade

## How to Apply It

1. **Catch the spiral** - Notice when you're creating stories to explain your anxious state
2. **Don't engage the story** - Instead of trying to fix the narrative, shift attention to your body
3. **Change your breath** - Use 4-4-8 breathing (exhale twice as long as inhale) to signal safety
4. **Adjust your posture** - Sit up straight, ground your feet, relax your shoulders
5. **Expand awareness** - Defocus your gaze and become aware of peripheral space
6. **Then proceed** - Once your state has shifted, make decisions or have conversations

## When to Use It

- Before high-stakes presentations or meetings
- When noticing anxiety without clear cause
- During conflict or difficult conversations
- Before making important decisions
- When you can't sleep due to racing thoughts
- Any time you notice your body is tense
