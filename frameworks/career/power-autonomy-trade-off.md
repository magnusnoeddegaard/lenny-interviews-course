# Power vs Autonomy Trade-off

> "You can have power or you can have autonomy, but you cannot have both." - James G. March (via Jeffrey Pfeffer)

## What It Is

The Power vs Autonomy Trade-off is a fundamental career principle that Jeffrey Pfeffer learned from Stanford colleague James G. March: the pursuit of power comes at the direct expense of personal freedom, and vice versa.

This framework serves as a crucial counterbalance to the drive for status and influence. While Pfeffer teaches how to acquire power, he emphasizes that the costs are real and often underappreciated. Understanding this trade-off helps people make intentional choices about what they truly want from their careers.

## How It Works

### What Power Costs

**Loss of time control:**
- Powerful people don't control their own schedules
- Every hour is booked for months in advance
- Others (assistants, stakeholders) determine how time is spent

**Intense scrutiny:**
- Everything you do is examined
- Past behavior gets re-evaluated under a microscope
- No privacy—what car you drive, who you associate with, how you spend time

**The trust dilemma:**
- Are people praising you for you, or your position?
- Genuine relationships become harder to form
- Sycophants and opportunists surround power

**Family impact:**
- Powerful roles demand time away from family
- The emotional toll affects spouses and children
- High divorce rates and relationship strain are common

### Pfeffer's Examples

**The Dean's wife:** A Stanford Business School dean's wife was dying of cancer. The school gave him fall off to be with her, but she lived until June. By then, he had obligations—alumni meetings, fundraising, university events. Power meant he couldn't spend her final months as he might have chosen.

**The schedule test:** When Pfeffer wanted to invite powerful guests to his class:
- He didn't call Jack Valenti (head of MPAA)—he called Jack's assistant Judy Dickey
- He didn't call Gary Loveman (CEO of Caesars)—he called his assistant Reggie Kirk
- Powerful people don't control their own calendars

**Satya Nadella:** When trying to book the Microsoft CEO for a podcast: "Every hour for the next three months is booked already. We know what he's doing."

### What Autonomy Offers

Pfeffer chose autonomy over power:
- No assistant controls his schedule
- His Outlook calendar isn't on any company computer
- He can adjust his schedule on a whim
- He controls how he spends his time

As he puts it: "If I said to you, 'I will give you $10 billion if you can have last week again'—you can't. Time goes in only one direction. I want control of my time."

## How to Apply It

1. **Get honest about what you want**: Do you actually want power, or do you want the things you think power brings?

2. **Understand the full package**: Power doesn't come à la carte. You get the influence AND the loss of autonomy.

3. **Consider the "price of power" class**: Pfeffer dedicates a session to this topic, including having children of powerful people share the impact on their families.

4. **Design your career intentionally**:
   - If you want autonomy, don't pursue traditional power paths
   - If you want power, accept and prepare for the trade-offs
   - Hybrid approaches exist but require careful calibration

5. **Revisit periodically**: What you want may change over time

## Questions to Ask Yourself

- If I achieve the powerful position I'm pursuing, what will my typical Tuesday look like?
- Who will control my calendar?
- What will I have to give up?
- How will this affect my relationships and family?
- Am I pursuing power, or pursuing what I think power represents?
- Could I get what I actually want through a different path?

## When to Use It

- When considering a promotion or new role with more responsibility
- When feeling envious of powerful people's positions
- When designing your career trajectory
- When evaluating whether the "next level" is worth pursuing
- When advising others on career decisions
- When feeling burned out by power's demands
