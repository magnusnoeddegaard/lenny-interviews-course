# Superpowers Identification (Peak Experiences Method)

> "Pull your superpowers out of your stories from your past, your present, and then eventually figure out how to apply them and transpose them to your future." - Donna Lichaw

## What It Is

The Superpowers Identification framework is a method for discovering your unique strengths by examining peak experiences throughout your life. Rather than relying on personality tests or abstract assessments, this approach grounds your superpowers in concrete memories where you were at your best—making them memorable, meaningful, and actionable.

Research shows that playing to strengths is far more effective than trying to fix weaknesses. But most people struggle to articulate their strengths beyond generic terms like "I'm strategic" or "I'm a good communicator." This method extracts specific, contextual superpowers that have genuine meaning because they're rooted in your actual lived experience.

The key insight is that your superpowers show up as patterns across multiple peak experiences—from childhood through your current role. When you overlay these stories, the recurring themes reveal what truly differentiates you.

## How It Works

**The Three-Story Method**

To identify superpowers, examine at least three peak experiences from different life stages:

1. **Childhood Story** - A project or activity from when you were young that completely lit you up
2. **Recent Professional Story** - A project from the last 10 years where you were at your best
3. **Career Origin Story** - The meandering path that led you to your current work

When you lay these stories on top of each other, your superpowers emerge at the intersection points—the recurring themes and capabilities that enabled your success across different contexts.

**What Makes a Peak Experience**

- You were at your best (not necessarily your happiest)
- It completely lit you up and energized you
- You made a meaningful impact
- The memory is vivid and significant

**Why Tests Fall Short**

Donna notes that assessments like StrengthsFinder provide lists that lack context: "If I just get a list of things, I will never remember what the list is." Superpowers extracted from your own stories are memorable because they come with built-in context and emotional resonance.

## How to Apply It

1. **Recall your childhood peak experience** - Go back as far as you can. What's something you did as a kid—a project, activity, or achievement—that completely energized you? Write down the story in detail.

2. **Identify a recent professional peak** - Think of a project or accomplishment from the last 10 years where you were truly at your best. What were you doing? Why did it matter?

3. **Map your career origin story** - How did you end up in your current work? What was the winding path? What decisions and activities felt right along the way?

4. **Find the patterns** - Lay these three stories side by side. What themes repeat? Look for:
   - Types of activities you were doing
   - How you approached problems
   - What roles you naturally took
   - What energized you in each case

5. **Name your superpowers** - Articulate 2-3 specific superpowers based on the patterns. Be specific—"connecting ideas, trends, and people" is more useful than "strategic thinking."

6. **Test and refine** - Share your identified superpowers with people who know you well. Do they recognize these patterns? What examples do they see?

## When to Use It

- When evaluating a new job or career direction (does it leverage your superpowers?)
- When feeling stuck or unfulfilled (are you using your superpowers enough?)
- When building a personal brand or positioning yourself
- When delegating work (give away what doesn't leverage your superpowers)
- When onboarding into a new role (how can you apply your superpowers here?)
