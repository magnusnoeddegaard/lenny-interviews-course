# PM Skills as AI Leverage

> "The people we see that are most successful are people that are amazing PMs. Because these are people that understand enough about how the technology works, and their job is to direct developers on how to go and improve the product... There's a huge overlap of the skill set of being a rock star PM, and being really good at using any of these text-to-app or Cogen tools." - Eric Simons

## What It Is

This framework identifies the surprising skill-transfer from product management to AI tool proficiency. As AI coding tools become more capable, the skills that matter most aren't traditional programming skills—they're the skills PMs already have: scoping work, writing clear specifications, debugging through iteration, and having taste about what's good.

Eric Simons observed this pattern in Bolt's user data: 67% of their users are not developers. The most successful non-developers aren't random—they're people with PM skills who already know how to direct developers effectively.

The implication is profound: PMs aren't being replaced by AI tools—they're the people best positioned to wield them.

## How It Works

**Why PM Skills Transfer to AI Tools**:

1. **Specification Writing** - PMs write JIRA tickets and PRDs. AI agents need the same clear, scoped instructions

2. **Technical Understanding** - PMs understand how software works without writing code. This is exactly what AI tools need—enough context to guide, not enough to manually implement

3. **Scope Management** - PMs know how to break big problems into smaller pieces. AI agents work best with well-scoped requests

4. **Debugging Through Iteration** - PMs iterate with developers to refine features. AI tools require the same "this isn't quite right, try this instead" loop

5. **Taste and Quality Judgment** - PMs know what good looks like. AI generates options; humans select the good ones

## How to Apply It

1. **Talk to AI tools like you talk to developers** - Eric's advice: "Talk to this thing like you do a Linear ticket, or a JIRA ticket"

2. **Be specific where it matters, leave room for creativity elsewhere** - "Be specific on things that matter. And on things where you can let it be creative, you can just say 'make it prettier'"

3. **Lean into your specification-writing skills** - The skill of clearly describing what you want is now directly executable

4. **Use AI for prototyping, not just production** - PMs can now validate ideas without waiting for developer time

5. **Don't wait for permission** - If you can direct an AI to build it, you can demonstrate the idea rather than just writing about it

## The Changing Org Chart

Eric argues that current org charts don't reflect this new reality. In the future:

- **PMs and designers will lead UI work**, with developers reviewing and supporting
- **Engineers will focus on intellectually challenging tasks** that AI handles poorly
- **The ratio shifts** from many engineers per PM to many PMs per engineer
- **"Writing code"** becomes a PM activity through AI tools

## Career Implications

For PMs: Your skills are more valuable, not less. The bottleneck is no longer "we need a developer to build this"—it's "we need someone who knows what to build and can articulate it clearly."

For founders: This is equally true. Product-thinking founders can now execute directly.

For designers: The same skill transfer applies—taste and judgment about what's good translates directly.

For engineers: Focus on the work AI can't do well yet—complex architectures, debugging edge cases, system design.
