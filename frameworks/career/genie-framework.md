# Genie Framework

> "Imagine that you're walking home from work, you see this bright, shiny object, and you realize it's a magic lamp. And you rub the lamp and this genie comes out and the genie says, 'Hey, I can give you one wish. Whatever you throw yourself into with your whole life and your career, it's going to turn out great.'" - Graham Weaver

## What It Is

The Genie Framework is a thought experiment designed to bypass your fear of failure and reveal your true career aspirations. By imagining a genie who guarantees success (but not ease), you unlock the answer to what you really want to do with your life.

Graham Weaver first encountered this exercise from motivational tapes by Brian Tracy when he was 13 years old, mowing lawns. He's since adapted it and uses it with his Stanford MBA students to help them identify their authentic career goals—ones they've often been talking themselves out of.

The key insight: when students come to Graham with career dilemmas (Option A vs Option B), they usually already know they want B. They're just looking for permission to pursue it and help dismantling the fears keeping them from it.

## How It Works

### The Exercise

1. **The Setup**: Imagine you're walking home from work and find a magic lamp. A genie emerges, but this genie isn't fully formed—they've only been in the bottle 10,000 years, not long enough for three wishes.

2. **The One Wish**: The genie offers this: "Whatever you throw yourself into with your whole life and your career, it's going to turn out great. It's probably going to take longer than you think. It's going to be harder than you think, but you're going to be really happy you did it, and it's going to work out beyond your wildest imagination."

3. **The Question**: If this were true, what would you wish for?

4. **The Answer**: Your answer is close to your heart—it's what you would do absent the fear of failure.

5. **The Conclusion**: That's what you should go do. Maybe not tomorrow if you have financial obligations, but "at some point in this one life we get, you want to get yourself on that path of that journey."

### Why It Works

The framework eliminates fear as a decision factor. Most career decisions are clouded by:
- Fear of financial failure
- Fear of looking foolish
- Fear of disappointing others
- Fear of the unknown

When success is guaranteed (even if difficult and slow), your true preferences emerge.

### Supporting Questions

Graham offers additional prompts if the genie question doesn't immediately unlock an answer:

- **If you didn't have to make money, what would you do?** (Reveals what you enjoy)
- **What's play for you that is work for other people?** (Naval Ravikant's question)
- **What's the thing you really want to do, but you're too embarrassed to say it?**
- **Who are people you admire and want to be more like? What do they do?**
- **Five to ten years from now, you're amazing, best in the world at X. What's X?**

## How to Apply It

1. **Find quiet time** - This requires space away from daily pressures
2. **Ask the genie question** - Write down your answer, even if it seems crazy
3. **Try the supporting questions** - See which one unlocks something
4. **Identify your fears** - What's stopping you from pursuing this?
5. **Create a path** - Even if you can't start tomorrow, how do you eventually get there?

### Example from the Episode

A Brazilian student came to Graham's class. His prior job was consulting, which he planned to return to. But when asked the genie question, he revealed he wanted to start a nonprofit in Brazil to help underprivileged students access education.

Over the course of the class, they "chipped away at all the fears and limiting beliefs of why he shouldn't or couldn't do that." By the end, that's exactly what he did.

## When to Use It

- **Career crossroads** - When deciding between options (you probably already know which one you want)
- **Feeling stuck** - When you're going through the motions but don't know why
- **Life planning** - During transitions or milestone ages
- **Coaching others** - Help them identify what they're talking themselves out of

## The Time Element

Graham emphasizes: the genie doesn't promise quick success. His own firm, Alpine Investors, took:
- 14 years to confidently know they'd stay in business
- 18 years to be "really successful by external standards"
- 23 years to have a "great run"

"The missing ingredient in most of the people that fail is time."
