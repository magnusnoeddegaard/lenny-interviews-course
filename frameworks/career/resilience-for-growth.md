# Resilience for Growth PMs

> "If you're doing product-led growth the right way, then you're going to fail more than you're going to be successful along the way. And if you're not resilient, that can be really demotivating." - Christopher Miller

## What It Is

Resilience is Miller's second-most important trait for growth PMs after relentless curiosity. It's the ability to persist through high failure rates without becoming demotivated or - more dangerously - starting to play it safe by making bets that are too small to matter.

Growth work has a statistical reality: only 20-30% of experiments typically succeed. This means 70-80% of your work won't "put numbers on the board." Without resilience, PMs start optimizing for the feeling of success rather than actual business impact.

## How It Works

### The Resilience Paradox

Lack of resilience creates a dangerous cycle:
1. Experiments fail at expected rates (70-80%)
2. PM becomes demotivated or anxious
3. PM starts choosing "safer" experiments
4. Experiments become too small to matter
5. Even successes don't move metrics
6. PM feels they can't win

**Key insight**: "If your primary modality of product-led growth work is experiment-driven product development and you're hitting more than 30-40% of the time, you're thinking too small."

### Healthy Resilience Looks Like

- **Extracting learnings from failures**: Every failed experiment teaches something
- **Maintaining ambitious bets**: Continuing to swing for impact despite misses
- **Separating identity from outcomes**: You're not your last experiment result
- **Long-term perspective**: Building a body of work, not a single win
- **Process focus**: Evaluating hypothesis quality, not just outcomes

## How to Apply It

### For Individual Growth PMs

1. **Reframe failure expectations** - Expect to fail most of the time; success is the exception
2. **Build a learning system** - Document what every experiment teaches, successful or not
3. **Review in batches** - Evaluate your portfolio of bets, not individual experiments
4. **Calibrate bet size** - If win rate is too high, you're being too conservative
5. **Find resilient peers** - Share war stories with others who understand the reality
6. **Celebrate learning, not just winning** - Create rituals around insight generation

### For Growth Leaders

1. **Set realistic expectations** - Communicate the 20-30% success baseline
2. **Reward ambitious failures** - Recognize well-designed experiments that didn't work
3. **Track bet quality** - Evaluate hypothesis formation, not just outcomes
4. **Create psychological safety** - Make it safe to report failures
5. **Watch for playing small** - High win rates may indicate insufficient ambition

### Warning Signs of Insufficient Resilience
- Only proposing experiments you're confident will work
- Avoiding metrics that might show negative results
- Over-celebrating small wins
- Reluctance to share experiment results
- Experiment velocity slowing down

## When to Use It

Resilience is critical when:

- **Building a growth career**: The job inherently requires tolerance for failure
- **Leading growth teams**: Your team takes cues from how you handle failure
- **Interviewing for growth roles**: Assess candidates' relationship with failure
- **Evaluating growth culture**: Is failure treated as learning or as shame?
