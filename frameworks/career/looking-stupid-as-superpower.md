# Looking Stupid as Superpower

> "Not everyone can look stupid in public over and over, but I believe it's my superpower and I try to make it my whole team's superpower too." - Farhan Thawar

## What It Is

The willingness to ask "dumb" questions, try things that might fail publicly, and persist when people tell you your question has already been answered—this is actually a superpower that accelerates learning far beyond what smart-but-cautious people achieve.

Most people avoid looking stupid because the social cost feels high. But this creates an information asymmetry: the person willing to ask the obvious question learns faster than everyone who stayed quiet with the same confusion.

Farhan describes receiving responses like "That's the stupidest fucking question I've ever heard" and "I've already explained this to you three times"—and continuing to ask anyway because understanding matters more than appearing smart.

## How It Works

**Why It's a Superpower:**
- Half the time you ask a "dumb" question, others had the same question but were scared to ask
- You learn through trying and failing, not through appearing competent
- Persistence through embarrassment builds genuine understanding
- The social cost of looking dumb is almost always lower than you imagine

**Building the Skill:**
- Get lots of "nos" and rejection early (sales, cold calling, retail)
- Screenshot the harshest feedback you receive as reminders that it doesn't kill you
- Keep asking until you understand, not until you're told to stop
- Focus on understanding the content, not on the other person's reaction

**The Team Version:**
- Model asking dumb questions publicly so your team sees it's safe
- Celebrate learning over appearing smart
- Make it explicit: we try weird things here, and sometimes they fail

## How to Apply It

1. **In meetings** - Ask the question you think is obvious. If you're confused, others probably are too.

2. **When learning new domains** - Persist through the "I've already explained this" responses. Understanding matters more than the other person's frustration.

3. **With experiments** - Try things that might break. Maybe you'll ruin some clothes, maybe you'll take down a system briefly, but you'll also discover shortcuts nobody else found.

4. **When building rapport** - Your willingness to be vulnerable creates psychological safety for others to ask their own "dumb" questions.

5. **In hiring** - Look for candidates who demonstrate curiosity over polish, who ask good questions over those who have all the answers.

## When to Use It

- Learning any new domain or technology
- Joining a new team or company
- Solving problems where best practices might be wrong
- Building team culture around learning
- Anytime you're genuinely confused

## Building Resilience to Looking Stupid

From Farhan's experience:
- **Retail work** - Getting rejected repeatedly by customers builds resilience
- **Cold calling** - Learning to take "no" and move to the next opportunity
- **Working in sharp rooms** - Being around people who will call out your dumb ideas directly
- **Screenshot harsh feedback** - Remind yourself that you survived the worst reactions
