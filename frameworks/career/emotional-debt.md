# Emotional Debt

> "In the same way that with technical debt, if you're building a product in the beginning, it's fine, and in fact it's even necessary. But if we don't pay off that technical debt or emotional debt, then over time it accumulates." - Jonny Miller

## What It Is

Emotional Debt is the accumulated stress load that builds up when your nervous system doesn't complete its natural stress-recovery cycle. When you experience stress, your body has a "mobilization cycle"—if that cycle isn't completed through proper downshifting and rest, the incomplete response gets stored in the body as "allostatic load."

Like technical debt in software, some emotional debt is necessary and even useful—it allows you to push through intense periods. But if not paid down, it compounds and creates fragility in your nervous system, eventually leading to burnout or health crises.

## How It Works

**How Debt Accumulates**
- Experiencing stress without recovery time
- Pushing through fatigue signals
- Buffering emotions instead of processing them
- Using substances to force relaxation (wine, CBD, etc.)
- Normalizing a constant "on" state

**Signs of High Emotional Debt**
- Disproportionate reactions to small things
- More reactive and snappy than normal
- Sleep disturbances or not feeling rested
- Relationship friction (especially intimate relationships)
- Unable to relax naturally without substances
- Racing thoughts at night

**The Threshold Effect**
- Debt accumulates until you exceed your "window of tolerance"
- Some people can carry debt for 5-10 years before crashing
- When the threshold is exceeded, there's often a complete crash
- The longer the accumulation, the longer the recovery

## How to Apply It

1. **Acknowledge the debt exists** - Recognize that pushing through has a cost
2. **Match work ethic with rest ethic** - Kevin Kelly: "If you have a great work ethic, match it with a great rest ethic"
3. **Build in intentional recovery** - NSDR, breathing practices, real time off
4. **Pay down incrementally** - Daily practices to prevent accumulation
5. **Take extended breaks** - After intense periods (8 months of push, 1-2 months of recovery)
6. **Work with a somatic practitioner** - For deeper accumulated debt

**Warning Signs You're in Debt:**
- You need alcohol or CBD to relax in the evening
- You can't remember the last time you felt truly rested
- Small frustrations feel disproportionately irritating
- Your body carries constant tension

## When to Use It

- When planning intense work periods
- During quarterly or annual reflection
- When noticing burnout warning signs
- After high-stress projects or launches
- When sleep quality declines
- When relationships start suffering
