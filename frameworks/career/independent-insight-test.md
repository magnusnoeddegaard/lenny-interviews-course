# Independent Insight Test

> "Why am I so lucky to have this insight? Why in a world of a million entrepreneurs who are thinking, who are smart, who are trying everything, why am I in the position where I likely have an insight that others do not?" - Jason Droege

## What It Is

The Independent Insight Test is a two-part self-examination that founders and entrepreneurs should conduct before committing to a new business idea. In a world where entrepreneurship is now "super cool" and millions of smart people are trying everything, the only way to find alpha in the market is to have an insight that isn't influenced by what everyone else is saying.

The test forces you to confront two critical questions: First, do you genuinely have an insight that others don't? And second, are you the right person to execute on it for the next 5-10 years?

## How It Works

The test has two components:

**Part 1: The Insight Question**
- What do I know that the world doesn't?
- Why would I be lucky enough to have this insight?
- Is this insight derived from independent research, or is it influenced by what I'm hearing around me?
- What's true that other people don't believe is true?

**Part 2: The Commitment Question**
- Why do I want to work on this problem for 5-10 years?
- Do I have a burning desire to constantly question myself on this problem?
- Am I willing to throw away who I am and all my previous ideas for this mission?

## How to Apply It

1. **Test for independent thinking** - If your research is heavily influenced by what the world is saying around you, you won't have an independent insight. Go off and do your own thing.

2. **Identify your unique position** - Maybe you're in a narrow, far-flung place no one else is looking. Maybe you're inherently contrarian. Maybe you have domain expertise others lack.

3. **Validate the insight** - Don't just talk to customers and hear "they have a problem" then rush to solve it. That's not a unique insight—anyone can do that.

4. **Test your commitment** - The insight alone isn't enough. You need the burning desire to pursue it through years of difficulty, self-doubt, and pivots.

5. **Don't fall in love with your ideas** - Part of independent thinking is being willing to throw away your ideas when they're wrong. Serve the mission, not your ego.

## When to Use It

- Before starting a new company or business unit
- When evaluating whether to pursue a new market or product
- When you find yourself excited about an idea that "everyone" seems to be talking about
- At inflection points when deciding whether to double down or pivot
