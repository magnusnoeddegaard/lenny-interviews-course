# Rest Ethic

> "Kevin Kelly said, 'If you have a great work ethic that needs to be matched with a great rest ethic.' And I think that kind of piece of actually training our capacity to downshift after stress is just completely missing from most people's playbooks." - Jonny Miller (quoting Kevin Kelly)

## What It Is

Rest Ethic is the principle that intentional, skilled recovery should be developed with the same seriousness as work habits. High performers typically have strong work ethics but completely lack a corresponding rest ethic. The ability to actively downshift—not just collapse in front of Netflix—is a trainable skill that most people have never developed.

This isn't about being lazy or working less; it's about making intense work sustainable by deliberately building recovery capacity.

## How It Works

**Work Ethic Without Rest Ethic**
- Ends the day exhausted
- Needs substances (wine, CBD) to relax
- Collapses on the couch with screens
- Carries tension into sleep
- Accumulates emotional debt
- Eventually crashes

**Work Ethic With Rest Ethic**
- Consciously downshifts at end of work
- Uses practices to complete stress cycles
- Can relax naturally without substances
- Recovers fully before next day
- Maintains energy over time
- Sustainable high performance

**Why We Need to Train This**
- Our ancestors didn't have chronic stress—rest happened naturally
- Modern work patterns keep us in constant low-level activation
- Default recovery (TV, alcohol, scrolling) doesn't actually restore
- The skill of downshifting has atrophied in most people

## How to Apply It

1. **Develop downshifting practices**
   - NSDR practice (15-20 min)
   - 4-4-8 breathing
   - Physiological sighing
   - Cold/hot exposure

2. **Create transitions**
   - End-of-workday ritual
   - Commute as transition (even if just a walk)
   - Change of clothes/environment

3. **Match intensity to recovery**
   - After 8 months of intense work, take 1-2 months to truly recover
   - After a high-stress day, do extra recovery practices
   - Build in daily, weekly, and quarterly recovery rhythms

4. **Monitor the balance**
   - Track emotional debt signals
   - Notice if you need substances to relax
   - Assess energy levels over time

**The Intentional Debt Strategy:**
"It is very much like building technical debt in the early days of a startup. It's worth doing, but just do it intentionally. Know that you're doing that. So let's say you work really hard for eight months, you give yourself a month or two off to really downshift."

## When to Use It

- When planning work periods and sprints
- When creating daily/weekly routines
- After recognizing burnout warning signs
- When struggling to relax without substances
- As part of career sustainability planning
