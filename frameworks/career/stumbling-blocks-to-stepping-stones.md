# Stumbling Blocks to Stepping Stones

> "The people who were most successful were the ones who actually through adversity, learned to turn stumbling blocks into stepping stones. They were the ones who got hard feedback and then came back stronger because now they learned what to do differently." - Deb Liu

## What It Is

This framework captures a key insight about career success: the most successful people aren't those who avoid failure—they're the ones who transform failures into growth opportunities. Trees grow strong because they're tested by wind, cold, and harsh conditions. Careers work the same way.

The framework challenges the common assumption that a "charmed career" (always working on successful products, always getting promoted) is ideal. In reality, people who've never faced adversity often lack the resilience and skills that come from overcoming challenges.

Deb Liu observed this pattern across years of coaching and managing: the best product leaders had the toughest stories and the hardest feedback, but they bounced back.

## How It Works

**The Two Career Paths:**

| "Charmed" Career | Resilient Career |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Always on successful products | Mixed portfolio of wins and failures |
| Easy promotions | Hard feedback that required growth |
| Never tested by adversity | Built strength through challenges |
| Risk: Fragile when first failure hits | Risk: Discouragement from setbacks |

**Why Adversity Creates Strength:**

1. **Learning from failure** - You learn different things from products that fail than from products that succeed
2. **Skill-building under pressure** - Getting resources when your product isn't working, not getting "pruned," navigating organizational challenges
3. **Resilience muscle** - Each recovery makes the next one easier
4. **Expanded toolkit** - Successful people have multiple strategies because they've had to adapt

## How to Apply It

1. **Reframe setbacks immediately** - When something goes wrong, ask: "What can I learn from this? How does this make me stronger?"

2. **Study your failures intentionally** - Don't just move on. Extract specific lessons about what to do differently

3. **Seek constructive feedback** - Hard feedback is a gift that shows you what to improve. Don't avoid it—seek it

4. **Don't wish for a charmed life** - Recognize that adversity is building capabilities you'll need later

5. **Build bounce-back speed** - Success isn't avoiding failure; it's recovering quickly. Practice getting back up faster each time

6. **Mentor others through their failures** - Help team members see setbacks as growth opportunities, not career-ending events

## When to Use It

- After receiving hard feedback
- When a product or project fails
- When you don't get the job or promotion you wanted
- Coaching team members through setbacks
- Deciding whether to take on risky projects
- Evaluating your career retrospectively

## Example from Deb Liu

When Mark Zuckerberg told Deb she would "never have" the role she wanted at Facebook, she faced a choice: leave for another company or turn her current role into something she wanted. She chose to transform the job she had with the team she had into something meaningful—turning that stumbling block into a stepping stone.
