# Future Self Perspective

> "One way that I've gotten clear on it is trying to think about it from future me. Because five years from now, I'm not going to give a sh*t if I made the presentation slightly better, but I'm going to care a lot about what kind of relationship I have with my daughters." - JM Nickels

## What It Is

Future Self Perspective is a decision-making technique that evaluates choices from the viewpoint of your future self, rather than from the urgency of the present moment. By imagining yourself 5, 10, or 20 years in the future looking back, you gain clarity on what will actually matter.

This technique counteracts the bias toward short-term optimization that high-achievers often fall into. In the moment, it always feels important to polish that presentation, respond to that email, or work one more hour. But from a future perspective, these "urgent" tasks often fade to insignificance while relationship investments and life experiences compound.

The technique is especially powerful when combined with awareness of mortality—remembering that life will end creates urgency around what truly matters.

## How It Works

**The Present-Future Disconnect:**
- Present self overweights immediate pressures (presentation is tomorrow!)
- Present self underweights compounding effects (daughter will be there next week)
- This creates a pattern where short-term always wins
- Years later, you've optimized for the wrong things

**The Technique:**
- Project yourself 5+ years into the future
- Ask: "Looking back, which choice will I be grateful for?"
- The answer is often surprisingly clear
- Use that clarity to make the present decision

**The Mortality Addition:**
- Most people pretend they'll live forever
- This enables endless deferral ("I'll spend time with family later")
- Awareness that life ends punctuates reality
- Forces honest prioritization of what actually matters

**The Key Quote:**
> "Most of us just aren't really tuned into an awareness that our lives will come to an end. And the horror of it is that we succeed. We mostly manage to just go live our life and eat ice cream and go to work... And that can lead us to doing things that ultimately don't matter in the long run."

## How to Apply It

1. **Before major decisions** - Pause and imagine yourself 5 years from now. Which option will you be glad you chose?

2. **During work-life conflicts** - Ask: "What will I wish I had done?" Usually the answer favors presence over productivity.

3. **When feeling urgency** - Question whether this urgency is real or manufactured. Will this matter in 5 years?

4. **Weekly practice** - At the end of each week, review: Did my time allocation match what future me would want?

5. **Use the "only people who remember" test** - As Lenny notes in the episode: "The only people who will remember you working late every night is your kids."

## When to Use It

- When choosing between work and family time
- At career crossroads (promotions that require sacrifice)
- When deciding whether to attend an important life event
- When "urgent" work tasks conflict with "important" life priorities
- During moments of doubt about life direction
- When you've achieved something and immediately chase the next thing
