# Mid-Stage Sweet Spot

> "People who are joining the workforce new should generally join mid-stage companies because mid-stage companies you get some mentorship and it's not just basically whatever needs to be done and ultimately you don't build any deep skills. Somewhere from 300 to 500 people that has not just reached product market fit, but product market, channel fit." - Gokul Rajaram

## What It Is

The Mid-Stage Sweet Spot is career guidance for choosing which company to join: 300-500 person companies offer the optimal mix of learning opportunity, career development, and financial upside. These companies have proven product-market fit, are scaling intentionally, and are large enough to provide mentorship while still offering significant growth opportunity.

Gokul applied this pattern throughout his career - joining Google, Facebook, and Square all at this stage (employee 600-800) - and recommends it especially for people newer in their careers.

## How It Works

### Why Mid-Stage Works

**You Get Mentorship:**
- Senior people exist who can teach you
- Processes are developed enough to learn from
- You're not reinventing everything from scratch

**You Build Real Skills:**
- Problems are complex enough to be interesting
- You work with talented people who push you
- The company has scale to see patterns and learnings

**There's Still Upside:**
- Equity can still be meaningful
- Career trajectory is rapid during growth
- You're not the 50,000th employee

**Risk is Reduced:**
- Product-market fit is proven
- The company will likely survive
- Your brand association has value

### The Company Profile

Look for companies at this stage that have:
- **Product-market fit** - Core product is working
- **Product-market-channel fit** - Growth channels are proven
- **Path to platform** - Thinking about multiple products
- **First product becoming bulletproof** - Strong competitive position
- **Active product thinking** - Not just riding existing success

### Gokul's Pattern

| Company | Employee # | Stage |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Google | ~600-800 | Post-IPO growth |
| Facebook | ~few hundred | Pre-IPO scaling |
| Square | ~700-800 | Post-launch scaling |
| DoorDash | ~1,500 | Via acquisition |

## How to Apply It

1. **Count the employees** - Target 300-500, but 200-1000 range works

2. **Verify product-market-channel fit:**
   - Is growth coming from repeatable channels?
   - Can they articulate how they acquire customers?
   - Is it sustainable without one-time hacks?

3. **Check for platform ambitions:**
   - Are they building multiple products?
   - Do products complement each other?
   - Is there a coherent vision beyond the first product?

4. **Assess the first product:**
   - Is it becoming category-leading?
   - Is the competitive position strengthening?
   - Are they solving real problems, not just growing?

5. **Evaluate mentorship potential:**
   - Who would you learn from?
   - Are there senior people in your function?
   - Is there a culture of development?

## When This Applies

**Best for:**
- People new to their careers
- Career changers building new skills
- Anyone optimizing for learning + upside

**Consider other stages if:**
- You're a proven executive who can build from scratch
- You have very high risk tolerance and want early-stage
- You specifically need big-company resources/brand

## The Warning on Early-Stage

Gokul explicitly warns against early-stage for most people:

> "Unless you know the founders very, very, very well, joining a very early stage company is, especially now for the next one or two years, it's going to be a brutal market out there."

The calculus changes if you deeply know and trust the founders, but the default should be mid-stage.
