# Full-Stack PM

> "Product managers have to own outcomes and not only features and parts of the problem... The full-stack product managers are the ones who are going to be more successful rather than product managers who are doing very good at one particular area only." - Anuj Rathi

## What It Is

The Full-Stack PM is a mental model for how product managers should develop their skills and approach their work. Rather than specializing deeply in one area (technical PM, growth PM, design PM), full-stack PMs build competency across the entire product value chain—from user psychology to marketing to engineering to business metrics.

The framework draws on the "range" concept from David Epstein's book: like Roger Federer who played many racket sports before specializing in tennis, PMs who build broad skills can connect more dots and ship better products.

## How It Works

### From Feature to Outcome

Narrow PMs think: "I shipped the feature. Engineering built it. It works."

Full-stack PMs think: "Did this feature change user behavior for the target segment in a way that achieved the business outcome and built lasting capability?"

That expanded definition requires competency in:
- **User psychology**: Why do users behave the way they do?
- **Marketing**: How do users discover and evaluate products?
- **Business**: What outcomes matter and why?
- **Engineering**: What's possible and at what cost?
- **Design**: How do users experience the product?
- **Data**: How do we measure success?

### The Business of Influence

A full-stack PM is really a "full-stack influencer":

- **Internal influence**: Engineers, designers, leadership, other PMs
- **External influence**: Users, customers, market
- **Influence tools**: Sales skills, marketing skills, negotiation skills

"You are in the business of influence, and you are doing this all the time internally. Otherwise, you're not successful even in shipping. Now, we have to extend this to our users."

### Range Over Depth

The analogy to Federer is instructive: early-career exposure to multiple domains creates a foundation for excellence. Ideas from one domain inform solutions in another. The PM who understands marketing can ship better products; the PM who understands engineering can propose feasible solutions.

## How to Apply It

1. **Expand your definition of success**
   - Don't just ship features—own outcomes
   - Ask: "What needs to be true for this to succeed?"
   - Consider: users, competition, marketing, business model, engineering

2. **Build partnerships where you lack depth**
   - You don't need to be an authority in every area
   - Build relationships with experts in marketing, engineering, data
   - Run your ideas through them; get weighted input

3. **Think like other functions**
   - What would marketing say about this feature?
   - What would a sales person need to sell this?
   - What would a user researcher want to know?

4. **Learn the language of adjacent domains**
   - Understand CAC, LTV, retention curves (growth)
   - Understand system architecture, tech debt (engineering)
   - Understand brand positioning, messaging (marketing)

5. **Practice influence explicitly**
   - Think of yourself as "in the business of influence"
   - Study sales and negotiation techniques
   - Apply influence skills both internally and to users

## When to Use It

- Career planning and skill development
- Evaluating your strengths and gaps
- Hiring and team building
- When features "ship successfully" but don't achieve outcomes
- When you're stuck at a career level

## Contrarian Take

Most PMs specialize too early. They become "the growth PM" or "the platform PM" before building broad foundations. This limits their ceiling. A PM who can only think about growth will never be a great CPO. Invest in range early in your career; specialize later.
