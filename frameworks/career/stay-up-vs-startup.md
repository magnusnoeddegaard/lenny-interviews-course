# Stay Up vs Startup

> "I'm so sick of the startups. It's cool to start a business, obviously, but I'm sick of that term dominating. Because, frankly, starting a business is actually way easier than staying in business. Literally tomorrow, I can start a new business. But, are you going to be there in two years? Staying is harder than starting." - Jason Fried

## What It Is

Stay Up vs Startup is a mindset shift that prioritizes business longevity over the excitement of launching. While startup culture celebrates the act of beginning—the pitch deck, the launch day, the first customers—stay up thinking celebrates the harder work of enduring.

The term "startup" implies a temporary state you pass through on your way to something else (usually an exit). A "stay up" is a business built to last, where the goal isn't to eventually sell or go public but to continue operating profitably indefinitely.

This reframe matters because what gets celebrated gets pursued. If starting is glamorous and staying is boring, founders will optimize for flashy launches rather than sustainable operations. But anyone can start a business tomorrow. Building one that's still thriving in 10 years requires a fundamentally different set of skills and priorities.

## How It Works

**Startup Thinking**:
- How do we launch with a splash?
- How fast can we grow?
- What's our exit strategy?
- When will we raise our next round?
- Temporary state before the "real" outcome

**Stay Up Thinking**:
- How do we become profitable quickly?
- How do we retain customers long-term?
- How do we build something we want to work on for decades?
- How do we stay small and sustainable?
- The business is the outcome, not a stepping stone

**The Reality Check**:
- Starting is easy—a name, a website, an idea
- The first wave of growth often comes from novelty
- Then comes the plateau—the real test begins
- Most businesses fail in years 2-5, not year 1
- Staying power comes from fundamentals, not hype

## How to Apply It

1. **Celebrate durability**: Look up to businesses that have lasted 20+ years, not just the latest unicorn.

2. **Build profitable from day one**: Don't plan to "figure out monetization later." Revenue is survival.

3. **Plan for plateaus**: Growth will stall. If you're only motivated by growth curves, you'll quit when they flatten.

4. **Develop staying skills**: Making money, managing costs, retaining customers, maintaining motivation through slow periods.

5. **Think in decades**: Would you still want to be doing this in 10 years? If not, maybe don't start.

6. **Resist premature optimization for exit**: Building to sell often undermines building to last.

## When to Use It

- Deciding whether to start a business
- Choosing between venture funding and bootstrapping
- Setting long-term business goals
- Evaluating what "success" means for your company
- When early growth creates false confidence
