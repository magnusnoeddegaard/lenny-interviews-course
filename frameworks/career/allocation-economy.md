# Allocation Economy

> "When you look at what skills are going to be valuable in the AI era, one big group of skills are the skills of managers. Today, they're human managers, tomorrow everyone's a model manager." - Dan Shipper

## What It Is

The Allocation Economy is a conceptual shift from the Knowledge Economy to describe how work will function in the AI era. While the Knowledge Economy valued people who could do specialized knowledge work, the Allocation Economy values people who can effectively allocate work to AI systems and manage their outputs.

The key insight is that the skills needed to manage AI agents are essentially the same skills managers use to manage people: communicating problems clearly, gathering the right information, giving feedback, having taste and judgment, knowing when to dive into details versus when to delegate.

Currently, only about 8% of the workforce are managers. In the Allocation Economy, these management skills become universally valuable because AI makes "management" dramatically cheaper—everyone can now have multiple AI "reports" working for them.

## How It Works

The framework identifies that using AI effectively requires:

1. **Problem Communication**: Articulating what you want clearly enough for the AI to understand
2. **Information Gathering**: Knowing what context and data the AI needs
3. **Model Selection**: Understanding which AI tool or model is best suited for each task
4. **Task Division**: Breaking work into appropriate chunks and deciding what goes to which agent
5. **Quality Evaluation**: Having the taste and judgment to assess whether output is good
6. **Feedback Delivery**: Knowing how to refine prompts and guide the AI toward better results
7. **Detail Calibration**: Deciding when to micromanage versus when to delegate

## How to Apply It

1. **Recognize the skills gap** - If you've never managed people, you'll need to learn management skills to effectively use AI. This is the new learning curve.

2. **Practice delegation thinking** - When tempted to do something yourself because "the AI won't do it right," recognize this as the classic first-time manager dilemma. Work on finding the right level of trust and oversight.

3. **Develop taste and judgment** - The most valuable skill becomes knowing what "good" looks like. AI can produce infinite outputs; you need to evaluate quality.

4. **Learn to give good feedback** - Prompting is really about giving clear feedback and direction—the same skill needed to develop human reports.

5. **Invest in vision** - Managers need to know where they're going. In the Allocation Economy, having a clear vision of what you want becomes even more valuable.

## When to Use It

- When thinking about which skills to develop for the future
- When explaining to skeptics why AI won't replace everyone but will change everyone's job
- When designing training programs for AI adoption
- When hiring—look for people with management potential, not just execution skills
- When struggling to get value from AI tools (you may have a management skills gap)
