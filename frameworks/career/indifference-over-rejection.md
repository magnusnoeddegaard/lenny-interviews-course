# Indifference Over Rejection

> "The worst thing that can happen to startup is not that people hate what you're doing, it's that they're completely indifferent to what you're doing." - Gustaf Alstromer

## What It Is

Indifference Over Rejection is Gustaf Alstromer's reframe for founders paralyzed by fear of customer rejection. He observes that most founders, especially technical ones, are "afraid of being rejected" when reaching out to potential customers. But this fear is based on a misunderstanding of how people actually respond to products they don't use.

The reality is that non-customers don't hate you - they simply don't care. And indifference gives you infinite second chances.

## How It Works

### The Sign-Up Memory Test

Gustaf illustrates with a common experience:

"Remember when you sign up for a service that's a cool service and you hear about it in TechCrunch or something like that and then you realize you already signed up a year ago? And then from the founder's perspective, you signed up to something you never used it."

The founder fears: "Everybody hates me because they sign up and they never use me."

The reality: "People sign up for it and be like, 'Oh, I'm busy. I got something else to do.' And they actually don't remember or care."

### Why Founders Fear Wrong

Technical founders building products have a distorted fear:

**What they imagine**: "If I put my thing out there and most people won't use it, they will tell all their friends how shitty this thing is."

**What actually happens**: People sign up, get distracted, forget, and feel completely neutral.

You've done this yourself with services you signed up for and never used. Did you develop intense hatred? No - you simply forgot.

### The Second Chance Implication

Because indifference (not hatred) is the default response:

- "It always gives you a second chance"
- You can reach out again in 2 weeks, 6 months, or a year
- Product improvements reset the relationship
- No bridges are burned by trying

## How to Apply It

### Before Customer Outreach

Remind yourself:
1. 90% of people won't respond - this is normal (see Early Adopter 10% Rule)
2. Those who don't respond don't hate you
3. Non-response means "not now" not "never"
4. You have infinite second chances

### After Rejection

Reframe the "no":
- They're not early adopters (that's about them, not you)
- Their time was already allocated (Mark Andreessen's point)
- Add them to a "reach out later" list
- Plan a follow-up in 3-6 months with product updates

### Processing Non-Response

The "allergic to rejection" founder interprets silence as:
- "They think my product is bad"
- "They're telling others not to use it"
- "I've lost them forever"

The realistic interpretation:
- "They're busy"
- "Now isn't the right time"
- "They might be interested later"

## When to Use It

- **When paralyzed by outreach fear** - Remember the sign-up test
- **After getting ghosted** - They didn't hate you, they forgot
- **When interpreting silence** - Indifference is the default
- **When planning follow-ups** - Second chances are always available

## The Related Airbnb Lesson

Gustaf connects this to Airbnb's early history:

"Even Airbnb was like air mattresses or staying in someone's homes when they're home. That was not the complete solution of Airbnb. But there were early adopters who dug in."

Most people ignored Airbnb initially. The 90% who weren't interested didn't hate the concept - they just weren't ready. The company kept iterating until the indifferent majority became interested.
