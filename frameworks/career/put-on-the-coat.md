# Put On the Coat of the Job

> "I try to just put on the coat of the job. When I wake up in the morning, I'm like, what would it be like if I were doing this job? What would I think about on my commute? Who would I have lunch with? Do I like them? What problems am I going to solve today?" - Ami Vora

## What It Is

Put On the Coat of the Job is a career decision-making heuristic that prioritizes emotional embodiment over analytical comparison. Instead of creating spreadsheets weighing pros and cons, you mentally step into the role and notice how it feels.

The core insight is that spreadsheet analysis—comp, title, growth trajectory, company stage—rarely predicts how good you'll actually be at a job. What predicts success is whether you feel at home, whether you trust the people, whether you feel lucky to be there.

Ami describes the typical decision-making engine: "You have a spreadsheet in your head of the axes and you work through all of this spreadsheet math of if I took this job, here's what it would do for me, here's where I'd be in five years." Her recommendation is to work through those spreadsheets and then **tear them up**, because none of that actually determines your success.

## How It Works

**The Traditional Approach:**
- List objective criteria (compensation, title, company stage, growth trajectory)
- Analyze and compare options
- Pick the option that scores highest

**The Coat Approach:**
- Mentally inhabit each option as if you already took it
- Pay attention to your emotional response
- Choose the one that feels like home

**Key Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- When I wake up in the morning doing this job, what would I think about?
- What would I think about on my commute?
- Who would I have lunch with? Do I like them?
- What problems would I be solving today?
- Do I feel like I'm lucky to be there?
- Does this feel like a place where I could be creative?

## How to Apply It

1. **Do the analytical work first** - You can't skip the spreadsheets entirely. Work through comp, title, trajectory, culture signals. Get that out of your system.

2. **Then set it aside** - Recognize that the analysis won't predict your actual success or happiness.

3. **Embodiment exercise** - For each option, spend time imagining your day-to-day:
   - Picture your morning routine in this job
   - Visualize conversations with colleagues
   - Imagine tackling the problems you'd face
   - Feel what it's like to walk through those doors

4. **Listen for home** - The key signal Ami looks for is trust. "Can I walk through and feel like these people are going to have my back, they're going to let me take risks, I'm going to enjoy spending time with them?"

5. **Trust the emotional signal** - If one option makes you feel lucky to be there, that's probably the right choice, even if the spreadsheet says otherwise.

## When to Use It

- Choosing between job offers
- Deciding whether to take a new role within your company
- Evaluating whether to leave your current position
- Any major career transition

## Caveats

- This isn't an excuse to skip due diligence—do the analysis first
- Works better for people who've developed self-awareness about their emotional signals
- Some practical concerns (compensation, location, stability) can't be ignored
- The "home" feeling can be cultivated over time; don't confuse unfamiliar with wrong

## The Anti-Plan Philosophy

Ami explicitly rejects having a master plan for her career:

> "I for a long time felt like I was held back because I don't have a plan, but I realized that probably the most important thing is to just acknowledge that that is true for me... the thing that has consistently served me is to do the thing that feels right, go to the place that feels like home, work with the people who feel like my friends."

This doesn't mean being passive. It means optimizing for fit and trust over trajectory and titles.
