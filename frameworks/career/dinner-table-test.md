# Dinner Table Test

> "When you're at a dinner table, what's the thing that you talk about where you notice that everyone at the table is leaning in and trying to listen and pick your brain on and maybe sends you a text after?" - Chris Hutchins

## What It Is

The Dinner Table Test is a simple heuristic for discovering what topic you should build a podcast, newsletter, or content brand around. Instead of analytically trying to identify market opportunities, look at what already happens naturally when you're in social situations.

The test relies on the insight that genuine expertise and passion are hard to manufacture, but easy to spot. When you talk about something that truly excites you and that you know deeply, other people notice. They lean in, ask follow-up questions, and reach out afterward for more.

This natural signal is more reliable than market research because it combines three crucial elements: your knowledge, your enthusiasm, and genuine audience interest.

## How It Works

**The Signals to Look For:**

1. **Physical engagement** - People lean in, put their phones down, make eye contact
2. **Follow-up questions** - Conversation naturally extends beyond small talk
3. **Post-event contact** - Someone texts or emails you afterward asking for more
4. **Information requests** - People ask you for specific recommendations ("Which credit card should I get?")
5. **Requests to help others** - "You should talk to my friend about this"

**Why It Works:**

Chris Hutchins was struggling to choose a topic for his podcast. A friend asked him this question, and he realized that whenever he talked about travel hacks, points and miles, saving money, or life optimization, everyone at the table engaged differently. They leaned in, asked specific questions, and followed up later.

This became All the Hacks—one of the biggest business podcasts in the world.

**What It Reveals:**

- **Topics you know deeply** - If people keep asking you questions, you clearly have knowledge they value
- **Topics you enjoy discussing** - You wouldn't keep bringing it up at dinner if you didn't love it
- **Topics with genuine demand** - The leaning in and follow-ups prove people want this information

## How to Apply It

1. **Reflect on recent social gatherings** - Think back to dinners, parties, or casual conversations. What topics kept coming up? When did the energy in the room shift?

2. **Notice the follow-ups** - Who reached out afterward? What did they want to know more about?

3. **Pay attention to repeat requests** - Are people regularly asking you about the same thing? That's a strong signal.

4. **Try the direct question** - Ask close friends: "What do you think I know a lot about that I should talk more about?"

5. **Test multiple topics** - If you're not sure, deliberately bring up different subjects at your next few social events and observe the reactions.

**What Passes the Test:**
- Travel hacks and points optimization (Chris Hutchins)
- Parenting from a dad's perspective (Chris's first idea, though passion faded after his daughter was born)
- Product management and career advice (Lenny Rachitsky)

**What Fails the Test:**
- Topics where you're the one asking questions, not answering them
- Topics that don't naturally come up in conversation
- Topics where people's eyes glaze over when you bring them up

## When to Use It
