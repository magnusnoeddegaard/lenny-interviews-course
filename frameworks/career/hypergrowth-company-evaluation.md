# Hypergrowth Company Evaluation

> "I actually have a Post-it note about what I look for. 10 parts of what would evaluate to see if it's a phenomenal company." - Carilu Dietrich

## What It Is

A systematic checklist for evaluating whether a company has the momentum to accelerate your career. Carilu developed this framework after spending five years post-Atlassian trying to identify her "next Atlassian"—a company with genuine hypergrowth potential rather than just good marketing.

The framework recognizes that picking the right company is one of the highest-leverage career decisions you can make. A rising tide lifts all boats: at Oracle, Carilu's team grew from 5 to 7 over five years. At Atlassian, it grew from 15 to 100 in four years. Same leader, dramatically different outcomes based on company momentum.

## How It Works

Evaluate companies against these ten criteria:

### Financial Health
1. **Rule of 40** - Profitability + growth rate should exceed 40%. This measures whether the company can grow sustainably.

2. **Net Dollar Retention** - How fast is revenue from existing customers growing? Snowflake's benchmark of 140-180% means they nearly doubled just from existing customers. 100% is neutral; anything below means churn.

3. **Growth Rate** - Last year's revenue growth trajectory

4. **Burn Rate** - Are they going to run out of money? What's the runway?

### Validation Signals
5. **Quality of Investors** - Are they top-tier VCs or unknown? Investors do due diligence, so their participation signals quality. But focus on recent rounds—they could have great early-stage investors but slowed down.

6. **Stage/Size** - Later stage = more reliable signal. Earlier companies haven't proven as much yet.

7. **Market Position** - Are they number one in their market? Do they have a Forrester or Gartner Magic Quadrant position? "People tell you if they're number one."

### Customer & Culture
8. **Net Promoter Score / Customer Satisfaction** - Do people genuinely love this product, or is it just "meh"?

9. **Glassdoor Rating** - Is it a bad place to work? Unhappy employees signal dysfunction, and unhappy companies don't survive as long.

10. **Product Quality** - The foundation everything else rests on. No amount of marketing can fix a mediocre product.

## How to Apply It

1. **Don't skip criteria because you're excited** - The framework is most valuable when you use all ten points, not just the ones that confirm your enthusiasm

2. **Focus on recent rounds, not historical** - A company with phenomenal Series A investors but a weak Series C tells a story of declining momentum

3. **Compare against benchmarks** - Know what "great" looks like for each metric (e.g., 180% NDR is exceptional, 100% is neutral)

4. **Watch for misalignment** - Great financials but terrible Glassdoor? Investigate why

5. **When in doubt, pick winners you can identify** - Early in your career, it's easier to join proven large winners (Salesforce, AWS, etc.) than to bet on unproven startups

## When to Use It

- Evaluating job offers from growth-stage companies
- Deciding which advisory roles to take
- Comparing multiple opportunities
- Due diligence before accepting a leadership position
- Identifying companies worth applying to proactively

## When NOT to Use It

- Very early stage (pre-Series A) where most metrics don't exist yet
- Non-growth contexts (lifestyle businesses, non-profits)
- When you have specific non-financial reasons to join (learning, mission, relationships)
