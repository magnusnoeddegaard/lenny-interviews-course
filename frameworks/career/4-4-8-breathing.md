# 4-4-8 Breathing

> "When the exhale is twice as long as the inhale, it has a calming effect." - Jonny Miller

## What It Is

4-4-8 Breathing is a simple breath technique where you inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, and exhale for 8 counts. The key principle is that the exhale is twice as long as the inhale, which activates the parasympathetic nervous system and creates a calming effect.

This is Jonny Miller's go-to practice for rapidly shifting from an anxious or activated state to a calm, grounded one. It can be done anywhere without anyone noticing, making it practical for real-world situations.

## How It Works

**The Technique**
1. Sit up straight, feel your body on the seat
2. Close your eyes if possible
3. Inhale through the nose for 4 counts
4. Hold the breath for 4 counts
5. Exhale slowly for 8 counts
6. Repeat for 1-2 minutes minimum

**The Science**
- The insular cortex monitors your breathing pattern
- Long exhales signal safety to the brain
- This triggers the parasympathetic nervous system
- The endocrine system shifts from cortisol/adrenaline to calming chemistry
- Your thoughts and feelings follow the state change

**Adjusting the Ratio**
- If 4-4-8 is too long: try 3-3-6 or 2-2-4
- If 4-4-8 is too short: try 5-5-10
- The key is exhale = 2x inhale
- Match to your lung capacity and CO2 tolerance

## How to Apply It

1. **Morning practice** - 2-5 minutes before starting work to build the habit
2. **Before presentations** - 5-15 minutes before high-stakes moments
3. **During stress** - In meetings or difficult conversations (no one notices)
4. **Recovery** - After stressful events to complete the stress cycle

**Jonny's TEDx Example:**
"I gave a TEDx talk a few years ago and I was terrified. I did 15 minutes of this breathing practice before and walked on stage almost cool as a cucumber."

**Optional Enhancement: Humming**
- End with one round of humming on the exhale
- Releases nitric oxide (vasodilator)
- Stimulates the vagus nerve
- Reduces eye tension from screen time

## When to Use It

- Before presentations, podcasts, or public speaking
- During difficult conversations or meetings
- When anxiety appears without clear cause
- Before important decisions
- When you can't fall asleep
- Anytime you notice tension or activation
