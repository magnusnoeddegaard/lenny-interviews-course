# Scrape Your Knees

> "A lot of what I did was scrape my knees through the first years and a lot of painful trial and error." - Christopher Miller

## What It Is

Scraping your knees is the recognition that product management cannot be fully learned academically - it requires making mistakes, failing, and learning from real-world consequences. While courses and content can teach fundamentals, the craft of PM requires hands-on failure to develop true judgment.

Miller learned PM by Googling "what is product management" and then spending years making mistakes. He argues this experiential learning is irreplaceable because product management involves managing personalities, navigating ambiguity, and handling situations that can't be simulated in a classroom.

## How It Works

The framework acknowledges three learning modes:

### 1. Academic Learning (Necessary but Limited)
- Fundamentals of prioritization, roadmapping, discovery
- Frameworks and mental models
- Best practices from others' experiences
- **Limitation**: "Taking a truly academic approach towards upskilling has fairly diminishing returns because it's tough to field curveballs in a classroom"

### 2. Knee-Scraping (Essential)
- Making wrong prioritization calls and seeing consequences
- Misjudging stakeholder dynamics
- Shipping bad product and learning from it
- Getting hard feedback and adjusting
- **Value**: Creates intuition that can't be taught

### 3. Mentored Learning (Accelerating)
- Learning from someone who's seen the movie before
- Getting real-time feedback on mistakes
- Observing expert pattern matching
- **Value**: Reduces severity of mistakes while preserving learning

## How to Apply It

### For Aspiring PMs

1. **Seek structure, not just opportunity** - Join companies with good PM training and experienced leaders
2. **Take on hard problems** - Volunteer for challenges beyond your comfort zone
3. **Treat failures as tuition** - Each mistake is an investment in judgment
4. **Find sponsors who'll let you fail** - Work for people who give you room to learn
5. **Reflect actively** - Extract maximum learning from each scrape

### For PM Leaders

1. **Create safe failure environments** - Let junior PMs make reversible mistakes
2. **Debrief failures constructively** - Focus on learning, not blame
3. **Share your own scrapes** - Normalize failure as part of growth
4. **Balance protection and exposure** - Shield from catastrophic mistakes, allow smaller ones
5. **Invest time in coaching** - Help extract lessons from their experiences

### What "Scraping Knees" Looks Like
- Shipping a feature no one uses and understanding why
- Misreading stakeholder priorities and learning to align
- Underestimating technical complexity and learning to scope
- Misjudging customer needs and learning to validate
- Getting product feedback that stings and using it

## When to Use It

Embrace knee-scraping when:

- **Early in PM career**: Years 1-3 are prime learning time
- **Entering new domains**: New industry or product type
- **After academic learning**: Translate knowledge to practice
- **When feeling too comfortable**: Growth requires discomfort

Create knee-scraping opportunities when:

- **Leading junior PMs**: Give them room to fail safely
- **Evaluating learning programs**: Supplement with real projects
- **Assessing candidates**: Look for evidence of learning from failure
