# The Magic Loop

> "Managers help those who help them. It's just human nature. We all do that." - Ethan Evans

## What It Is

The Magic Loop is a five-step framework for advancing your career regardless of your current situation or manager quality. It works by creating a mutually beneficial partnership between you and your manager where both parties' goals become aligned.

The framework is called "magic" because it works in almost every circumstance and has produced dramatic results for practitioners—including people who went from redundancy to multiple promotions within a year, and mid-level engineers who rose to executive positions within eight years.

The fundamental insight is that most managers aren't actively thinking about your career development. They're busy with their own responsibilities. The Magic Loop puts you in control of your career progression rather than waiting for a manager to notice your potential.

## How It Works

**Step 1: Do Your Current Job Well**
Before anything else, ensure you're performing at a solid level. Your manager can't focus on your growth if they're wishing you were different. You don't need to be the star performer, but you need to be meeting expectations. Talk to your manager and address any performance issues first.

**Step 2: Ask Your Manager How You Can Help**
Very few people go to their manager and ask "What can I do to help you? What do you need?" Just asking this question sets you apart and begins building the foundation of a partnership—signaling that you're on the same team and invested in their success.

**Step 3: Do What They Ask**
Follow through on whatever they request, even if it's not exciting work. If they say "We really need someone to handle the maintenance work," do it. Don't dig a hole by asking how you can help and then declining the help they actually need.

**Step 4: Connect Your Help to Your Goals**
After demonstrating reliability, return to your manager and say: "I'm enjoying working with you. Is there something I could help you with that would also help me reach my goal?" Whether that goal is a promotion, a raise, learning a new skill, or changing roles—make it explicit. This is where the magic happens, because your interests and your manager's interests become aligned.

**Step 5: Repeat**
Continue the loop. As trust builds, the relationship strengthens. With good and even moderate managers, they'll increasingly lean into helping you because you've helped them.

## How to Apply It

**Basic Mode (Steps 1-5):**
1. Schedule a check-in with your manager to understand where you stand performance-wise
2. If feedback is good, ask: "What could I do to help you? What do you need?"
3. Complete whatever they ask, thoroughly and without complaint
4. Return and say: "My goal is [specific goal]. Is there something you need that would also help me work toward this?"
5. Document your contributions and repeat monthly

**Advanced Mode (for senior levels):**
Instead of asking how you can help, start suggesting what needs to be done. Proactively identify problems and say "I noticed we have this issue—I've started working on it." At executive levels, you're expected to anticipate needs and keep leadership in the loop rather than wait for direction.

## When to Use It

- When you want a promotion but don't know how to get there
- When you have a busy or inattentive manager
- When you're unclear on what gaps are keeping you from the next level
- When you want to change roles or move to a different part of the organization
- When you've been stuck at your current level for too long
- When you're new to a team and want to build trust quickly

Note: Even if you don't want a promotion, the framework helps you shape your role. Use it to request different projects, rebalance work-life priorities, or transition to new areas while maintaining value to your manager.
