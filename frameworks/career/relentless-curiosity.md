# Relentless Curiosity

> "One of the traits that I look for in PMs that I hire onto my teams... is relentless curiosity, this insatiable desire to understand things and a lack of fear in admitting when they don't understand things and being uncompromising and getting the answers so that they do understand." - Christopher Miller

## What It Is

Relentless curiosity is the top trait Christopher Miller looks for when hiring product managers. It goes beyond simple intellectual curiosity to encompass an uncompromising drive to deeply understand problems, systems, and customer behaviors.

The key differentiator is the absence of ego or fear around not knowing. Truly curious PMs don't pretend to understand things they don't - they ask questions until they genuinely comprehend. This willingness to admit ignorance, combined with persistence in finding answers, enables outsized impact on any team or mission.

## How It Works

Relentless curiosity manifests in several ways:

1. **Active questioning**: Continuously asking "why" until you understand root causes
2. **Fearless admission of gaps**: Openly acknowledging what you don't know without embarrassment
3. **Uncompromising pursuit**: Not settling for surface-level explanations
4. **Cross-functional exploration**: Seeking to understand how different parts of the business connect
5. **Customer immersion**: Going beyond data to truly understand customer motivations

## How to Apply It

1. **Make asking questions a habit** - In every meeting, seek to understand the "why" behind decisions and data
2. **Embrace not knowing** - When you don't understand something, say so immediately rather than pretending
3. **Follow threads to completion** - When something piques your interest, research until you fully understand it
4. **Talk to people outside your team** - Miller recommends spending time on sales floors and in other departments to absorb context
5. **Challenge assumptions** - Question the underlying premises of product decisions, even your own
6. **Document your learnings** - Turn curiosity into institutional knowledge that helps the team

## When to Use It

Relentless curiosity is always valuable, but especially critical when:

- **Joining a new team or company**: Use it to quickly build context and relationships
- **Evaluating product opportunities**: Understand the full scope before committing resources
- **Working on growth**: PLG requires understanding both quantitative data and qualitative customer motivations
- **Building relationships with stakeholders**: Genuine curiosity about others' problems builds trust and collaboration
- **Hiring**: Look for this trait in candidates - it predicts success better than domain expertise
