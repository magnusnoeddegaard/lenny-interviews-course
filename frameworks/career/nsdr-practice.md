# NSDR Practice

> "By the end of it, you feel like you've had a two-hour nap. It feels incredible." - Jonny Miller

## What It Is

NSDR (Non-Sleep Deep Rest) is a practice coined by Andrew Huberman based on the ancient yoga practice of yoga nidra. It involves lying down and following a guided body scan audio that induces deep relaxation without actually sleeping. Jonny Miller calls this his "most played practice of everything that I teach."

The practice is particularly valuable for people who struggle with afternoon energy dips, have difficulty downshifting from work mode, or are paying down emotional debt.

## How It Works

**The Practice**
1. Lie down in a comfortable position
2. Put on an eye mask or blindfold
3. Listen to a 14-20 minute guided audio
4. The audio guides you through a body scan with relaxing background music
5. Let go and follow the instructions

**Benefits**
- Feels like a 2-hour nap in 15-20 minutes
- Improves interoception through guided body scanning
- Gives your nervous system a break from sympathetic activation
- Strengthens ventral vagal tone (ability to downshift)
- Creates a "second wind" for afternoon productivity

**Optimal Timing**
- Best between 1-3pm during the natural energy dip
- Can be used in the evening to transition from work mode
- Some people use it to fall asleep at night

## How to Apply It

1. **Schedule it** - Block 20 minutes in your calendar, ideally early afternoon
2. **Create conditions** - Quiet space, eye mask, comfortable position
3. **Use guided audio** - Follow a recorded NSDR practice (Jonny has free versions)
4. **Be consistent** - Daily practice yields best results
5. **Notice the difference** - Compare your afternoon energy with and without it

**Kevin Kelly Quote:**
"If you have a great work ethic that needs to be matched with a great rest ethic."

**Why It Works Better Than Napping:**
- No sleep inertia (grogginess after waking)
- Specific practices for nervous system reset
- Builds interoceptive capacity simultaneously
- Can be done even if you "can't nap"

## When to Use It

- Afternoon energy dips (1-3pm)
- After intense meetings or work blocks
- When transitioning from work to personal time
- When sleep-deprived but can't actually sleep
- During high-stress periods to prevent debt accumulation
- As part of burnout recovery
