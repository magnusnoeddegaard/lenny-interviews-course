# Impact Equation

> "Impact is the thing to optimize for. Compensation is a reflection of the impact that you're having." - Bangaly Kaba

## What It Is

The Impact Equation is a career framework that treats impact as the primary output to optimize, with two input variables: environment and skills. Instead of focusing directly on compensation, title, or prestige, this framework argues that all of these are derivatives of impact. If you maximize impact, everything else follows.

The formula is: **Impact = Environment × Skills**

This multiplicative relationship means that even exceptional skills will be limited if your environment constrains you—and a perfect environment won't help if you lack the skills to capitalize on it. Both must work together.

## How It Works

### Environment Variables (Score each 0-2)

The environment includes six factors that affect your ability to have impact:

1. **Manager** - Do you have a supportive, empathetic manager who communicates well and can move chess pieces to fix problems? This is the most critical variable because a great manager can influence all other environment factors.

2. **Resources** - Do you have the right team size, budget, and P&L to accomplish what needs to be done?

3. **Scope** - Is your remit appropriate? Too little scope limits impact; too much creates burnout.

4. **Team** - Do you have team members with the right skills and capabilities?

5. **Compensation** - Are you compensated fairly? If not, it's hard to feel the work is meaningful.

6. **Culture** - Do you feel supported, included, and able to do your best work?

Score each on a scale from 0 to 2 in quarter-point increments:
- **2**: Greatly benefiting from this factor
- **1**: Neutral
- **Below 1**: This factor is limiting your impact

### Skills Variables

The skills component includes four areas:

1. **Communication** - The most impactful skill; strong communicators often rise despite weaker execution
2. **Influence** - Ability to persuade others and get buy-in
3. **Strategic Thinking** - Seeing the big picture and making smart tradeoffs
4. **Execution** - Actually getting things done

## How to Apply It

1. **Annual Assessment**: Score each environment variable yearly. Be brutally honest about what's limiting your impact.

2. **Identify the Constraint**: Look for scores below 1. These are active constraints on your impact.

3. **Evaluate Changeability**: For each constraint, ask: "To what extent do I believe this can and will change?" Some factors are fixable; others require leaving.

4. **Manager as Lever**: If multiple environment factors are problematic, consider whether a better manager relationship could fix them. Managers have power over scope, resources, team composition, and culture.

5. **Dispassionate Communication**: Before leaving, clearly articulate your challenges to your manager. Tie constraints back to impact on your work. See if they can help create a plan.

6. **Build Skills Continuously**: Invest in reading, podcasts, and mentorship. Watch how great practitioners hone their craft and steal their techniques.

## When to Use It

- Annually as a career health check
- When you feel stuck or burned out
- Before making a major job change decision
- When trying to understand why impact isn't matching effort
- During career conversations with your manager
