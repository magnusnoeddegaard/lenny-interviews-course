# Emotional Inquiry

> "Imagine you're a little kid and you pick up a toad. You're going to pick it up, you're going to look at it, you're going to feel it, you're going to smell it. Some little kids are even going to lick it a little bit. They're going to really want to explore this toad." - Joe Hudson

## What It Is

Emotional Inquiry is a somatic and mental practice for developing emotional fluidity. Like a child curiously exploring a toad, you explore your emotional experiences in your body—feeling them, observing them, noticing what happens when you welcome them, love them, or resist them.

The practice differs from simple mindfulness or "non-judgmental awareness." While those approaches accept emotions, Emotional Inquiry actively invites and welcomes them. Hudson uses the metaphor of children in your house: telling emotions "I will be non-judgmentally aware of you" produces a very different result than greeting them with "I'm so excited to see you! I welcome you in my house!"

This practice is particularly important for those who experienced emotional abuse—defined as being told you weren't allowed to have certain emotions (being punished, bribed, shamed, or having love withdrawn when expressing specific feelings). Such experiences can literally cut off the ability to feel certain emotions, just as physical abuse can cut off physical sensation.

## How It Works

**The inquiry process:**
1. Notice an emotion present in your body
2. Locate the physical sensation associated with it
3. Get curious about what you're experiencing
4. Experiment with different responses to the emotion
5. Observe what changes

**Key explorations:**
- What does this emotion feel like physically?
- Where do I feel it in my body?
- What is the quality of the sensation?
- What happens when I welcome this emotion?
- What happens when I love this emotion?
- What happens when I resist this emotion?

**The felt sense:**
- Move beyond mental concepts about emotions
- Access the actual somatic experience
- Let gratitude, joy, or whatever emotion "speak" rather than your mind
- Physical sensations reveal what mental analysis misses

## How to Apply It

1. **Start where you are** - Pick an emotion you can already identify (you don't need to access all emotions immediately)

2. **Drop into your body** - Move attention from thinking about the emotion to feeling it physically

3. **Approach with wonder** - Adopt a child's curiosity, not an adult's analysis

4. **Run experiments** - Try different ways of relating to the emotion and notice what happens

5. **Allow expression** - If expression arises (sounds, movement), let it happen—emotions sometimes need to move, not just be observed

6. **Be patient** - Emotions that have been held for years may take time to fully move. Pure stillness may eventually work, but expression speeds the process.

## When to Use It

- As a daily practice for emotional development
- When you notice you're stuck and don't know why
- When feeling overwhelmed (often indicates unexpressed emotions)
- When a few familiar emotions are accessible but others feel blocked
- When you want to expand your emotional range
- As entry-level practice for developing emotional fluidity
