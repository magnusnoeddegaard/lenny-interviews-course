# Burn the Boat Commitment Test

> "Founders who were still getting a paycheck and health insurance, once the going got tough, they did not quit their job. And you sort of need that desperation like, 'I have to make this startup succeed because it's my job.' Not like, 'Oh, I'll just stay at Google.' You need that. You have to burn the boat." - Jessica Livingston

## What It Is

The Burn the Boat Commitment Test is a principle from Y Combinator's founder evaluation that states true startup commitment requires founders to eliminate their safety nets - primarily by quitting their day jobs. The metaphor comes from military history where commanders would burn their ships upon landing to eliminate retreat as an option.

The test isn't about being reckless - it's about recognizing that startups demand complete focus and that the psychological safety of a backup plan undermines the desperation needed to push through inevitable hard times.

## How It Works

**The Core Insight**: Founders who maintain full-time employment while building a startup have an escape hatch that changes their psychology. When things get difficult (which they always do), having that paycheck and health insurance makes quitting too easy.

**What Y Combinator Observed**:
- Founders who kept their jobs consistently underperformed
- When startups hit rough patches, employed founders often chose their jobs
- Co-founders who wouldn't leave employment frequently departed the company
- The desperation of having no safety net drove creative problem-solving

**The Exception**: Starting on the side is reasonable when you're just getting started and not raising money. But once you're serious about building a company, the boat must burn.

## How to Apply It

### For Founders Evaluating Themselves

1. **Ask the honest question**: "Am I willing to quit my job for this?"
2. **If the answer is no**, examine why - it may reveal doubts about the idea or your commitment
3. **Set a deadline**: Give yourself a timeline for when you'll make the leap
4. **Do the math**: Calculate your runway and what you need to survive without salary

### For Investors Evaluating Founders

1. **Ask directly**: "Are you planning to quit your job? When?"
2. **Watch for hedging**: Vague answers like "eventually" or "when we raise" are warning signs
3. **Understand the why**: Some founders have valid financial constraints - distinguish between "can't" and "won't"
4. **Check for co-founder parity**: Are all founders equally committed?

### For Founders Making the Decision

1. **Build runway first**: Save enough to survive 6-12 months minimum
2. **Validate enough to have conviction**: You don't need certainty, but you need belief
3. **Coordinate with co-founders**: Everyone should be on the same timeline
4. **Make it real**: Once you decide, set a departure date and stick to it

## When to Use It

- Evaluating whether you're ready to go full-time on your startup
- Assessing potential co-founders or early employees
- Investor due diligence on early-stage founders
- Recognizing when a side project should become the main thing
- Understanding why a startup isn't making progress

## Nuances

- **Financial circumstances matter**: Someone supporting a family has different constraints than a 23-year-old
- **Timing is contextual**: The right moment to jump varies by situation
- **It's about psychology, not judgment**: This isn't moral evaluation - it's pattern recognition
- **Health insurance considerations are real**: Especially in the US, this is a genuine factor to plan for
