# Learning Acceleration Loop

> "You can't do homework. You can't do exercises. You can't do fake stuff. You have to work on real products at real companies with real customers, with real data to get better at product management." - Fareed Mosavat

## What It Is

The Learning Acceleration Loop is a framework for how product managers develop expertise and advance their careers. Unlike skills that can be learned through coursework or certifications, product management requires "specific knowledge"—expertise that can only be gathered by actually doing the work.

The framework acknowledges that while books, courses, podcasts, and mentorship can help, they are "just a layer on top" of the real work. The core of PM skill development is execution—delivering great products over and over again. However, there are ways to accelerate this loop and make each rep more valuable.

## How It Works

The loop has four stages that feed into each other:

### 1. Execute
Do the actual work—partner with engineering and design, ship products, solve real customer problems. This is the foundation that everything else builds on. Early in your career, this is almost 100% of your time.

### 2. Generalize
Don't just solve a specific problem—extract lessons that apply more broadly. Ask yourself: "What did I learn that I can apply to other products or problems?" This is where external learning (courses, reading, conversations) helps by connecting your experience to frameworks others have discovered.

### 3. Communicate
Share what you're doing and what you've learned. You can't just do great work—you have to make it visible. This creates organizational impact by changing how others think about problems, and it builds trust with leadership and peers.

### 4. Scale Your Opportunities
Communication and demonstrated expertise lead to bigger opportunities—problems with more unknowns, more autonomy, and broader scope. Then you execute again at this higher level.

## How to Apply It

1. **Early in your career:** Focus almost entirely on execution. Take known problems with known solutions and deliver them well. Build your foundation of reps.

2. **After each project:** Spend time generalizing. Ask: "What worked here that might work elsewhere? What patterns did I see? What would I do differently?"

3. **Connect to external learning:** Use courses, books, and conversations to accelerate generalization. They help you see how your specific experience fits into broader patterns.

4. **Communicate proactively:** Don't wait to be asked. Share learnings in team meetings, write internal posts, teach others what you've discovered. Make your expertise visible.

5. **Seek sponsors:** Great execution plus great communication attracts sponsors—people who will trust you with bigger opportunities.

## Example

Fareed shares an example from Instacart where he was working on onboarding:

> "We tried the slimmest, fastest, lowest friction, least number of steps path in, and then we had this hypothesis about helping people get set up. So we took the opposite approach... The generalization is, 'Oh, for products that had a high bar to activation, sometimes more setup and higher friction, good friction, could actually help those customers be successful.'"

This generalization—that friction can help in high-bar products—became something he could apply to other products and problems.

## When to Use It

- When planning your career development strategy
- When evaluating how to spend your learning time
- After completing a project (to maximize learning from it)
- When feeling stuck in your career progression
