# Energy Management (Schedule for Energy)

> "Being able to manage my energy levels and figuring out how to schedule my time for my energy has really allowed me also to figure out how to have that abundant mindset in all situations." - Anneka Gupta

## What It Is

Energy Management is the practice of scheduling your work around your personal energy patterns rather than just time availability. By understanding when you have high energy versus low energy throughout the day, you can match your most demanding work to your peak energy times—dramatically improving both performance and mindset.

This framework acknowledges that not all hours are equal. A difficult strategy meeting at 2pm might go well, while the same meeting at 5pm might be a disaster—purely because of your energy levels.

## How It Works

**The Core Principle:**
Your energy levels follow predictable patterns throughout the day. By mapping these patterns, you can:
- Schedule difficult work during high-energy periods
- Protect high-energy time from low-value meetings
- Accept that some hours are "low-value" and use them accordingly
- Bring your best self to challenging situations

**Energy Multipliers:**
- Proper meals (not skipping lunch for a protein bar)
- Sleep quality and duration
- Physical movement
- Mental breaks between demanding tasks

**Energy Drains:**
- Back-to-back difficult meetings
- Working through natural low-energy periods
- Skipping meals or nutrition
- Insufficient recovery time

## How to Apply It

1. **Map your energy pattern** - Track your energy levels throughout the day for a week. Note when you feel sharp vs. foggy, energized vs. depleted.

2. **Identify your worst time** - Anneka knows that 5-6pm is her worst time. Know yours.

3. **Protect peak hours** - Block your highest-energy time for work that requires creativity, difficult conversations, or strategic thinking.

4. **Match work to energy** - Schedule demanding tasks (strategy decks, difficult feedback conversations, high-stakes meetings) during peak energy periods.

5. **Use low-energy time wisely** - Save administrative tasks, email, and routine work for lower-energy periods.

6. **Invest in energy** - Don't skip lunch. Don't sacrifice sleep for "productivity." These are investments that pay dividends.

## When to Use It

- When designing your weekly schedule
- When accepting meeting invitations
- When planning difficult conversations
- When you notice recurring patterns of poor performance at certain times
- When approaching challenging situations with scarcity mindset
- When feeling burned out despite managing your time well

## The Mindset Connection

Anneka connects energy management to maintaining an "abundant mindset." When you're depleted, you default to scarcity thinking—seeing challenges as insurmountable hurdles. When you're energized, you can approach the same challenges with creativity and optimism.

Managing energy isn't just about performance—it's about being able to bring your best self to difficult situations and maintain the positive mindset that enables success.
