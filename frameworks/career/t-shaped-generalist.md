# T-Shaped Generalist

> "My special T or my superpower is that I'm a T-shaped generalist. I know a little about a lot of things from finance to business to product. I have to go a lot deeper in product in the areas that I specialize in—that's where the tail of the T comes in. But it's precisely because I've had a diverse background that makes me more effective when I'm trying to get things done within the organization." - Julia Schottenstein

## What It Is

The T-Shaped Generalist is a skill profile where you have broad knowledge across many domains (the horizontal bar of the T) combined with deep expertise in one or two areas (the vertical stem of the T). This combination makes you uniquely effective at getting things done in organizations where cross-functional work is required.

Julia Schottenstein developed this profile through an unconventional path from VC to product management, and argues that the broad base actually accelerates effectiveness in her deep area.

## How It Works

### The Shape Explained

```
                    GENERALIST (Broad Knowledge)
    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    Finance | Business | Markets | Technology | Operations
                           │
                           │
                           │  SPECIALIST (Deep Expertise)
                           │
                           │  Product Management
                           │  (Your primary domain)
                           │
                           │
                           ▼
```

### The Horizontal Bar: Breadth

"Know a little about a lot":
- Finance: How businesses make money, valuations, metrics
- Business strategy: Markets, competition, positioning
- Technology: How things get built, technical tradeoffs
- Operations: How organizations run, processes
- Go-to-market: Sales, marketing, distribution

This breadth creates:
- **Credibility**: You can speak the language of multiple disciplines
- **Pattern recognition**: You see connections others miss
- **Context**: You understand how your work fits the bigger picture

### The Vertical Stem: Depth

"Go deep in your specialties":
- Your primary craft (e.g., product management)
- Specific domain knowledge (e.g., data infrastructure)
- Technical skills specific to your work

This depth creates:
- **Expertise**: You're genuinely good at what you do
- **Authority**: People trust your judgment in your domain
- **Impact**: You can execute at a high level

### Why Both Matter

Julia's experience shows why breadth amplifies depth:

> "Venture capitalists spend all their day meeting lots of different companies, context switching. They have to know a little bit about quite a lot of different things... I've brought a lot of those skills with me into product and it translates really well."

Breadth without depth = generalist who can't execute
Depth without breadth = specialist who can't collaborate

## How to Apply It

### Step 1: Identify Your Stem

What is your primary domain of deep expertise?
- This should be where you want to be genuinely excellent
- Where you're willing to put in the deliberate practice
- What you're paid to do well

For Julia: Product management in data infrastructure

### Step 2: Build Your Bar Intentionally

Identify 4-6 adjacent domains that matter for your work:
- What disciplines do you interact with regularly?
- What knowledge would make you more effective?
- What do you need to "speak the language" of?

For Julia: Finance, business strategy, markets, technology

### Step 3: Invest in Learning Each

For each breadth area, aim for:
- **Functional literacy**: Can discuss intelligently
- **Key frameworks**: Know the mental models experts use
- **Vocabulary**: Can communicate without translation
- **Not mastery**: You're a tourist, not a resident

### Step 4: Connect Breadth to Depth

Use your broad knowledge to be better at your specialty:
- Financial literacy → Better at pricing decisions
- Technical knowledge → Better at roadmap tradeoffs
- Market understanding → Better at positioning

### Julia's Network Investing Strategy

One way to build breadth efficiently:

> "I still spend a lot of time investing in my network... I try to build a network of operators at other companies that are like dbt Labs that are growing nicely, maybe a little bit ahead of where we are. I ask them: How did you navigate open source? Pricing? Acquisitions? Then I take the best ideas and bring it back."

- Invest in relationships with experts
- Ask specific questions in their domains
- Synthesize insights across conversations
- Apply learnings to your deep work

## When to Use It

- **Career development**: Designing your learning investments
- **Role transitions**: Leveraging existing breadth in new domains
- **Cross-functional leadership**: Understanding stakeholder perspectives
- **Strategy work**: Connecting dots across disciplines

## The Risk: Jack of All Trades

The anti-pattern is breadth without depth:
- You can talk about everything
- You're expert at nothing
- You can't execute

The T-shape requires genuine depth in the stem. The bar is built on top of real expertise.
