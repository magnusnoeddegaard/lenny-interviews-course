# Not Losing Before Winning

> "Not losing is a precursor to winning... If you ever get on the other side of a high reward, high risk decision, it is so painful because you are just cooked. You are done, and often there's no way out." - Jason Droege

## What It Is

Not Losing Before Winning is a risk management philosophy that challenges the tech industry's default "just go for it" mentality. While the dominant narrative encourages bold risk-taking, the best entrepreneurs and business owners actually look carefully at the risk profile of every decision and try to make asymmetrically positive bets.

The insight is that survival is a prerequisite for success. Most people give up before they get their timing right, before they find the right insight, before they build the right product. Life can change quickly in tech—you can go from being a dog to a hero in a short period—but only if you're still in the game.

## How It Works

The framework operates on several principles:

**Survival as Precondition**: You can only thrive if you survive. No matter how good your idea or how capable your team, dead companies don't pivot.

**Asymmetric Decision-Making**: The best entrepreneurs don't just "go for it"—they look for decisions where the upside significantly outweighs the downside.

**Hype Cycle Awareness**: In hype cycles (like the current AI boom), everyone wants to go for it more and more. This is precisely when survival-first thinking becomes most important.

**Long-Term Orientation**: Your customers will still be around in five years. Your job is to be around to solve their problems for them.

## How to Apply It

1. **Examine the risk profile** - Before making major decisions, explicitly map out the risk profile. What's the downside if this fails completely?

2. **Look for asymmetric bets** - Seek decisions where success brings outsized returns but failure doesn't destroy the enterprise.

3. **Don't confuse boldness with recklessness** - "Just go for it" is often the advice of people building portfolios (investors), not people building companies.

4. **Maintain optionality** - Don't put yourself in positions where a single decision could compromise the entire enterprise.

5. **Resist hype cycle pressure** - When everyone else is going all-in, that's exactly when to think about preservation.

## When to Use It

- During hype cycles when "FOMO" drives decisions
- When evaluating high-stakes bets that could sink the company
- Before making irreversible commitments of capital or reputation
- When feeling pressure to match competitor aggressiveness

## The Counterbalance

This framework doesn't mean avoiding all risk. It means:
- Taking calculated risks with bounded downside
- Preserving the ability to learn and iterate
- Ensuring you can survive long enough for good timing and good luck to find you
