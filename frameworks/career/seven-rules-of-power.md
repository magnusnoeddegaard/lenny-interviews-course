# Seven Rules of Power

> "If you want power to be used for good, more good people need to have power." - Jeffrey Pfeffer

## What It Is

The Seven Rules of Power is a framework developed by Stanford professor Jeffrey Pfeffer based on decades of organizational behavior research. It distills the evidence-based principles that lead to acquiring influence and advancing in one's career.

Pfeffer emphasizes that these are learnable skills, not innate personality traits. Research by Gerald Ferris on political skill demonstrates that mastering these principles is associated with higher salary, faster promotions, greater job satisfaction, and lower stress.

The framework acknowledges that power dynamics often differ from how we think the world "should" work, but argues that understanding reality is essential for anyone who wants to accomplish meaningful things. As Pfeffer notes, "If change was going to happen, it would've happened already. You have to take on entrenched interests."

## The Seven Rules

### Rule 1: Get Out of Your Own Way

Stop self-sabotaging through:
- **Imposter syndrome**: Believing you don't deserve your position
- **Pre-emptory apologies**: "I don't know if this is useful, but..."
- **Aversion to power**: Thinking power is dirty or beneath you
- **Excessive worry about being liked**: "If you want to be liked, get a dog"

You were hired to perform a role. Use your skills without apologizing for having them.

### Rule 2: Break the Rules

Rules favor incumbents. To stand out and succeed:
- Do things differently than expected
- Ask for what you want (worst case: you're no worse off)
- Challenge conventional wisdom in your field
- Be willing to disrupt established norms

Example: Jason Calacanis built a venture career by doing the opposite of traditional VCs—many small bets, no partners, lean operations.

### Rule 3: Appear Powerful

How you present yourself matters enormously:
- **Body language**: Open posture, eye contact, confident gestures
- **Voice**: Speak louder, don't trail off
- **Physical presence**: Stand close, appropriate touch (handshakes, shoulder)
- **No notes**: Demonstrate mastery of your material
- **Never apologize unnecessarily**

Research shows we respond primarily to how people look, secondarily to how they sound, and least to content. Steve Jobs wasn't born a great presenter—Regis McKenna coached him into that role.

### Rule 4: Build a Powerful Brand

If no one knows who you are, you cannot advance:
- Create visibility for yourself and your work
- Differentiate yourself from others in similar positions
- Write, speak, create content, build relationships
- Develop a unique style or approach

Example: Laura Chau at Canaan Partners built her brand through writing, a podcast, networking dinners, and even playing up her unique physical presence as "the tallest Asian woman" many had met.

### Rule 5: Network Relentlessly

Networking is fundamentally about generosity:
- Focus first on how you can help others
- Become a broker who connects people
- Pursue weak ties (people different from you) for non-redundant information
- Build a broad network to increase knowledge and opportunities

Example: Omid Kordestani spent his time at Netscape networking instead of doing his assigned work. When Google needed their first business hire, his name appeared on every list. He became employee #11 and made $2.5 billion.

### Rule 6: Use Your Power

Power compounds when exercised:
- Success attracts more resources and opportunities
- People want to associate with successful people
- Using power demonstrates competence and builds reputation
- Not using power you have undermines your position

### Rule 7: Success Excuses (Almost) Everything

Once you've acquired power:
- People forget or forgive how you got there
- Wealth and success attract people regardless of past actions
- Life is self-fulfilling, not homeostatic
- The myth of Icarus (that overreach will be punished) is largely false

## How to Apply It

1. **Assess yourself** on each of the seven rules—where are you strong/weak?
2. **Get coaching** or build a personal board of directors for support and accountability
3. **Start small** with uncomfortable actions—push yourself 15% beyond your comfort zone
4. **Practice deliberately** through "Doing Power" exercises:
   - List 10 people who could help your career, then figure out how to meet them
   - Write and refine a personal brand statement
   - Record yourself presenting and get feedback
5. **Don't just read**—the Knowing-Doing Gap means learning disappears without practice

## When to Use It

- When you're not advancing despite strong performance
- When you feel uncomfortable with self-promotion or politics
- When you need to build influence to accomplish important goals
- When you want to understand why some people succeed despite seeming disadvantages
- When you're from a background that puts you at a systemic disadvantage

## The Trade-off

Pfeffer offers an important caveat: "You can have power or you can have autonomy, but you cannot have both."

Power comes with:
- Loss of control over your time
- Intense scrutiny of everything you do
- The "trust dilemma"—are people with you for you, or your position?
- Impact on family and relationships
