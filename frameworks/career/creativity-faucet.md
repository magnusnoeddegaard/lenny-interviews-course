# Creativity Faucet

> "Why do good ideas arrive after the bad ideas are empty? It's because when you've gone through a bunch of bad ideas, your brain starts reflexively identifying what elements are causing the badness. Then it becomes way better at avoiding those bad elements and you become way better at pattern matching the novel ideas." - Julian Shapiro

## What It Is

The Creativity Faucet is a mental model for generating creative ideas, discovered by Julian Shapiro after noticing the same process used by three of the most prolific creators: Neil Gaiman, Ed Sheeran, and John Mayer (plus Taylor Swift).

The model visualizes creativity as a backed-up pipe of water. The first mile of pipe is packed with wastewater (bad ideas). This wastewater must be emptied before the clear water (good ideas) behind it can arrive.

Since your creativity pipe only has one faucet, there's no shortcut. You can't skip to the good ideas - you must empty the bad ones first.

## How It Works

### The Core Process

1. **Visualize the pipe**: Your creativity contains both bad and good ideas, but they're queued up - bad first, good behind
2. **Open the faucet**: At the beginning of every creative session, write out every bad idea that comes to mind
3. **Don't resist**: Instead of being self-critical about bad ideas, recognize them as progress
4. **Keep emptying**: Once bad ideas are out, better ideas begin to arrive

### Why It Works

When you've gone through many bad ideas, your brain starts:
- Reflexively identifying what elements cause the badness
- Getting better at avoiding those bad elements
- Pattern matching toward novel ideas with greater intuition

### The Iteration Process

You start with a weak imitation, identify what makes it weak, then iterate until it's finally original.

This is what prolific creators like Neil, Ed, John, and Taylor know: they're not superhuman. They simply have the discipline to allot time - no matter how long it takes - to empty all the bad ideas in every creative session.

### The Mistake Most Creators Make

Most creators resist their bad ideas. They sit down, scribble a few thoughts, and walk away because they weren't struck with gold. But this means they never actually finished the creative process. There's no way they would have come up with gold.

The discipline is in staying with the process long enough for the clear water to arrive.

## How to Apply It

1. **Allot sufficient time**
   - Don't expect instant brilliance
   - Some sessions may take an hour to empty the bad ideas
   - Trust that good ideas will come if you persist

2. **Write without judgment**
   - Let the bad ideas flow onto the page
   - Don't delete or dismiss them
   - Treat them as necessary progress, not failure

3. **Track your pattern recognition**
   - Notice what makes ideas bad
   - Your brain will start avoiding those patterns
   - This builds creative intuition over time

4. **Apply to any creative work**
   - Writing (fiction, non-fiction, blog posts)
   - Music composition
   - Product design
   - Problem-solving
   - Any ideation process

5. **Embrace the "shitty first draft"**
   - The first version will be bad - that's the point
   - Refinement happens through iteration
   - Most of the work is in editing, not initial creation

## When to Use It

- **Writer's block**: When you're stuck, keep writing - the block is just wastewater
- **Brainstorming**: Generate many ideas before evaluating any
- **Creative sessions**: Start every session with this mental model
- **Perfectionism**: When you're tempted to quit because it's not good yet
- **Any creative endeavor**: Music, design, writing, coding, problem-solving
