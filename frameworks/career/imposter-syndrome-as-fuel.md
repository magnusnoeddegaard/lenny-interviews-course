# Imposter Syndrome as Fuel

> "Imposter syndrome, it's something everyone has at one point or another. When we default to these behaviors... I know it doesn't feel good, but we default to that because it's serving us in one way, otherwise it wouldn't become a habit." - Donna Lichaw

## What It Is

The Imposter Syndrome as Fuel framework offers a counter-intuitive approach to dealing with imposter syndrome: instead of fighting it, embrace it as a functional signal that drives growth. When you feel like an imposter, you've likely hit a "growth edge"—the boundary between your current capabilities and the next level.

The conventional advice is to combat imposter syndrome through affirmations, "fake it till you make it," or rational arguments about your qualifications. But this framework suggests that imposter syndrome persists because it's actually useful—it triggers behaviors that help you learn and improve.

The key insight is that imposter syndrome exists on a spectrum. A little bit drives healthy growth; too much leads to overwork and burnout. The goal isn't elimination but calibration—learning to recognize when it's serving you and when it's starting to hurt.

## How It Works

**The Growth Edge Signal**

Imposter syndrome typically kicks in when:
- You've entered a new role or challenge
- You're operating at the edge of your competence
- Stakes feel high and failure seems possible
- You're comparing yourself to others who seem more qualified

Rather than seeing this as a problem, recognize it as data: you've reached a growth edge where learning is available.

**The Functional Response Pattern**

When imposter syndrome triggers, it often drives productive behaviors:
1. Working harder and more thoroughly
2. Learning new skills (reading books, taking courses, seeking mentors)
3. Over-preparing to compensate for perceived gaps
4. Seeking feedback and validation
5. Not coasting on past success

These behaviors often lead to actual improvement—which is why the pattern persists.

**The Spectrum Problem**

The same mechanism that drives growth can drive burnout:

| Healthy Dose | Unhealthy Dose |
|--------------|----------------|
| Read a book on the topic | Read 20 books |
| Prepare thoroughly | Over-prepare obsessively |
| Seek appropriate feedback | Need constant validation |
| Work hard to close gaps | Do 10x more work than necessary |
| Learn new skills | Take on everyone else's work too |

Donna specifically notes that women often over-index, taking on emotional labor for others and doing far more than necessary to prove themselves.

## How to Apply It

1. **Recognize the trigger** - When imposter syndrome hits, pause and name it: "I'm feeling like an imposter. I've probably hit a growth edge."

2. **Ask "How is this serving me?"** - What productive behaviors is this feeling driving? Are you learning? Preparing better? Seeking helpful feedback?

3. **Embrace the growth signal** - Give yourself credit for being in a challenging position. As Donna notes, especially in tech, "half of the roles we have are all made up. You're probably the first person ever to have your role anyway."

4. **Watch for over-indexing** - Monitor whether the response has become excessive:
   - Are you doing work that isn't yours to do?
   - Are you preparing beyond what's necessary?
   - Is the emotional toll disproportionate to the situation?

5. **Calibrate your response** - Find the productive middle ground where imposter syndrome drives learning without driving burnout. Channel the energy toward specific, bounded learning rather than unbounded overwork.

6. **Normalize it** - Remember that imposter syndrome is universal, especially when doing hard things. It doesn't mean you're wrong for the role—it might mean you're exactly right for it.

## When to Use It

- Starting a new job or taking on new responsibilities
- Getting promoted into an unfamiliar role
- Founding a company or leading a new initiative
- Presenting to senior stakeholders or public audiences
- Any situation where you feel underqualified relative to the stakes
