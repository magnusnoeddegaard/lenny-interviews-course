# AFOG (Another Fucking Opportunity for Growth)

> "Every student who ever took a class from me, every client who I have ever coached, every participant who's ever gone through Leaders in Tech knows that acronym because my question, when something has gone wrong or a person has experienced a failure, my first question is always, so what did you learn?" - Carole Robin

## What It Is

AFOG—Another Fucking Opportunity for Growth—is a reframing technique for dealing with failures, mistakes, and setbacks. The slightly irreverent acronym makes the concept memorable and defuses the emotional weight of failure in the moment.

The framework is built on two premises:
1. There's always a lesson in failure if you're willing to look for it
2. Putting failure in perspective—with a touch of humor—makes it easier to extract that lesson

The profanity is intentional. When something goes wrong, most people are upset, frustrated, or self-critical. Meeting that emotion with clinical language ("This is a learning opportunity") can feel dismissive. AFOG acknowledges the emotional reality—yes, this sucks—while immediately redirecting toward growth.

## How It Works

**The AFOG Response Process:**

1. **Acknowledge the failure** - Something went wrong. Don't pretend it didn't happen.

2. **Ask "What did you learn?"** - This is the critical first question. Not "What went wrong?" or "Whose fault was it?" but "What did you learn?"

3. **Reframe with AFOG** - "Yeah, you just had an AFOG." This creates a moment of levity and perspective.

4. **Extract the lesson** - What specifically can you take forward? What would you do differently?

5. **Move forward** - Most AFOGs are recoverable, especially if you've done the work of unpacking the lesson.

**Why AFOG Works:**

- **Memorable**: The acronym sticks, so you recall it when you need it
- **Permission-giving**: Acknowledges that failure feels bad while normalizing it
- **Action-oriented**: Immediately points toward learning rather than wallowing
- **Perspective-granting**: Positions the failure as one event in an ongoing growth journey
- **Community-building**: When teams share the language, it creates psychological safety around failure

## How to Apply It

**For Personal Use:**

1. When you experience a failure or setback, notice your emotional response
2. Say to yourself: "AFOG—what did I learn from this?"
3. Write down the lesson while it's fresh
4. Ask: What would I do differently next time?
5. Move on, knowing you've extracted the value

**For Teams:**

1. Introduce the acronym—share what it means
2. Use it in retrospectives and post-mortems
3. Model it as a leader when you make mistakes
4. Ask "What did we learn?" before asking "What went wrong?"
5. Build a culture where AFOGs are expected, not shameful

**AFOG Variations:**

Some AFOGs are small and easily processed. Others are significant and take time to recover from. The framework doesn't minimize the pain—it just insists that growth is possible regardless of the severity.

## When to Use It

- After a project failure or missed deadline
- When you make a mistake in an important presentation
- During career setbacks like missed promotions or job losses
- When a relationship goes sideways despite good intentions
- Coaching team members through their failures
- Building resilience in yourself and others
