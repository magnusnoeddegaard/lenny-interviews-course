# Top 1% PM Attributes

> "Given the same amount of skill intelligence and resources, a product manager with a great innate ability to prioritize is going to generate 5X the impact of someone without that skill." - Ian McAllister

## What It Is

The Top 1% PM Attributes framework identifies the core skills and qualities that separate elite product managers from the rest. Based on Ian McAllister's extensive experience managing over 100 PMs at Amazon, Airbnb, and Uber, this framework provides a roadmap for PM development at every career stage.

The original framework became one of the most influential posts on product management, helping countless PMs understand what to focus on to grow in their careers. Importantly, no single PM masters all these attributes—the goal is continuous improvement across the ones most relevant to your current stage.

## How It Works

**Core PM Attributes (Essential at All Levels):**

1. **Communicate** - Clear thinking leads to clear communication. Can you answer questions directly? Use numbers effectively? Write concisely?

2. **Prioritize** - The number one key tool of a PM. Applies to roadmaps, project sequencing, feature scope, and time management.

3. **Execute** - Ship what you said you'd ship, when you said you'd ship it. Be the driving force behind the team's momentum.

4. **Simplify** - Do more with less. Find elegant solutions that maximize impact while minimizing complexity.

5. **Think Big** - Always ask: could this be bigger? Hunt for larger impact opportunities even when the initial idea sounds good.

6. **Earn Trust** - Trust is the currency of product leadership. Build it by repeatedly setting and meeting expectations.

**Additional Attributes:**

7. **Forecast and Measure** - Predict outcomes, execute, then validate. This builds instincts over time.

8. **Understand Technical Trade-offs** - You don't need to be an engineer, but technical fluency helps you simplify and get more from resources.

9. **Understand Good Design** - Think like your customers and users.

10. **Write Effective Copy** - Communicate to customers with few words.

11. **Dig for Data** - Don't depend on analysts. Develop your own tools to find information.

12. **Push Back Effectively** - Say no strategically. If you say yes to everything, you go nowhere.

13. **Adapt to Change** - How you react impacts morale and your ability to rally the team.

14. **Driven by Impact, Not Promotion** - Wake up thinking about impact, not career advancement.

## How to Apply It

**For New PMs (Focus on the Core Three):**

1. **Communicate** - Practice answering "when" questions with dates. Grade yourself after every meeting and email. Ask: "How could I have answered that better?"

2. **Prioritize** - Be hungry for impact. Find the metric that defines success and focus all team resources on moving it up and to the right.

3. **Execute** - Mold your scope into a simple, compact package with highest impact. Help your team get better at every sprint.

**For Senior PMs (Add These):**

1. **Think Big** - Look beyond the initial scope. Ask "could this be bigger?" at the start of every initiative. Take a wider view of what influences success.

2. **Earn Trust** - Treat trust as your currency. Tell the truth without fail. Launch what you said you'd launch. Own your mistakes.

3. **Driven by Impact** - Let impact guide every decision. Promotion follows impact, not the other way around.

## When to Use It

- During career planning and self-assessment
- When developing PMs on your team
- When identifying gaps in your skill set
- During performance reviews to set growth goals
- When transitioning from IC to leadership roles
