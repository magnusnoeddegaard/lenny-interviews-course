# Full-Stack Product Roles

> "I think you need to get decently good at all three. There's just a minimum baseline of if you're any one of those roles, you need to be minimally good at the other two, and then you can go deeper into your own specialty... You could be a designer who's really good at thinking about UX and interaction design, and then just good enough to be dangerous on thinking about what's technically possible and what is the product story around this feature." - Howie Liu

## What It Is

Full-Stack Product Roles describes the shift away from purely specialized roles (PM, designer, engineer) toward requiring baseline competency across all three disciplines. In the AI era, the most effective people can think holistically about product problems—understanding technical constraints, design implications, and product strategy simultaneously.

This doesn't mean everyone becomes a generalist. Rather, it's an expansion of the minimum viable skill set: you maintain deep expertise in one area while building working knowledge of the other two.

## How It Works

**The Traditional Model:**
- PMs write requirements
- Designers create mockups
- Engineers build to spec
- Handoffs between specialized roles

**The Full-Stack Model:**

Each role maintains depth in their specialty while building baseline skills in the other two:

| Role | Deep Expertise | Minimum Viable Skills |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| PM | Product strategy, customer insight | Can prototype; understands technical feasibility; has design sensibility |
| Designer | UX, visual design, interaction | Can build interactive prototypes; understands product context; knows technical constraints |
| Engineer | Technical implementation, architecture | Can think about product story; has design sensibility; understands user problems |

**Why AI Accelerates This:**

- AI tools let anyone prototype working software
- The gap between "idea" and "working demo" has collapsed
- Speed requires fewer handoffs
- AI products require experiencing, not just specifying

## How to Apply It

Steps for developing full-stack capabilities:

1. **Learn to prototype** - Use AI tools (Cursor, Replit, Lovable) to build working demos regardless of your role
2. **Study the other disciplines** - Read about design principles, product strategy, or technical architecture depending on your gap
3. **Do weekend projects** - Build complete small things that require all three skills
4. **Ask better questions** - Instead of handing off, understand the constraints of other roles
5. **Review holistically** - When evaluating work, consider product, design, AND technical perspectives

## When to Use It

This model is increasingly essential when:

- You work in AI or rapidly evolving technology
- Your team values speed and iteration over process
- You want to reduce handoff friction
- You're building products where the form factor is still being invented

It's less critical when:
- You're in a highly specialized role with deep technical requirements
- The product domain is stable and well-understood
- Your organization has effective handoff processes
