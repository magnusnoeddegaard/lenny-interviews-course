# A-Side B-Side Career Framing

> "We are very encouraged in our lives, especially professionally, to talk about our A-sides all the time. Because that's what impresses people, that's what opens doors, that's what allows us to keep growing... It means that a lot of what you hear in podcasts and on stage ends up being the Instagramable version of someone's trajectory. It's just the highlights." - Gina Gotthilf

## What It Is

Like a record album with an A-side (the hits) and a B-side (the deeper cuts), every career has two parallel stories: the highlight reel we share publicly and the struggle story we often hide. The A-Side B-Side framework helps you recognize that the polished success stories you see from others are incomplete—and that your own B-moments are normal, not failures.

The problem is that professional culture encourages us to share only our A-side. This creates a distorted picture where everyone around you seems to have a smooth trajectory while you're navigating setbacks. When you don't recognize B-moments as moments, it's easy to believe your career is uniquely broken.

Gina's own B-side includes dropping out of college due to depression, applying to 100 companies and hearing back from almost none, getting fired multiple times, losing visas, and going unpaid for six months at Tumblr. Between these lows came the A-side highlights: helping Duolingo grow from 3 to 200 million users, meeting President Obama, and raising from Andreessen Horowitz.

## How It Works

**Recognizing the A-Side**

The A-side is what you put on LinkedIn, mention in podcasts, and use to open doors:
- Major accomplishments and milestones
- Companies and people you've worked with
- Awards, promotions, and recognition
- Projects that succeeded dramatically
- Numbers and metrics that sound impressive

**Acknowledging the B-Side**

The B-side is what happens between highlights:
- Rejections and failed applications
- Jobs that didn't work out or ended badly
- Periods of uncertainty about your direction
- Projects that flopped or never shipped
- Times when you felt lost, depressed, or stuck

**The Key Insight**

Most people experience more B-moments than A-moments—especially early in their careers. The ratio might be 80/20 or even higher. But we only share the 20% that worked, creating a false impression that success is the default state.

**The Resilience Effect**

When you understand this framing, two things shift:

1. **Comparison becomes less damaging** - Others' A-sides aren't the full story
2. **Your B-moments become survivable** - They're moments, not permanent states

## How to Apply It

1. **Inventory your own sides** - Write out both your A-side highlights and your B-side struggles. Seeing them together provides perspective on your actual journey.

2. **Share B-side stories selectively** - In appropriate contexts (mentoring, networking with peers, authentic conversations), share B-side moments. It builds genuine connection and helps others feel less alone.

3. **Listen for hidden B-sides** - When you hear someone's impressive story, remember there's an untold B-side. Don't compare their public A-side to your private B-side.

4. **Recognize B-moments as moments** - When you're in a low point, remind yourself: this is a B-moment, not your entire story. "This too shall pass."

5. **Reframe B-sides as A-sides-in-waiting** - Many B-side experiences become the foundation for later A-side wins. Getting fired from one job might lead to the opportunity that defines your career.

6. **Trust the long timeline** - Your career is longer than you think. There's time for many A-moments even when you're deep in a B-period. As Gina notes, at 26 she thought her career was over—looking back, that's funny.

## When to Use It

- When comparing yourself unfavorably to others' success stories
- When experiencing a significant setback or period of struggle
- When mentoring someone who feels like a failure
- When building authentic professional relationships
- When deciding what to share publicly about your journey
- When feeling imposter syndrome from others' polished narratives
