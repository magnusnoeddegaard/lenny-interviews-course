# Elastic Demand Industries

> "In terms of jobs, I would respond with a category of things that have very elastic demand... When we make people 10 times more productive, we'll build 10 times, if not 100 times as much software." - Brendan Foody

## What It Is

Elastic demand industries are sectors where increased productivity expands total demand rather than reducing headcount. When technology makes workers 10x more productive, these industries don't need 1/10th the workers—they produce 10x more output and create more opportunities.

This framework helps navigate career decisions in an AI-transforming economy by identifying which industries will see job growth versus displacement as AI augments human capabilities.

## How It Works

Industries sit on a spectrum from inelastic to elastic demand:

**Inelastic (limited expansion potential):**
- Accounting - "Realistically we only need so much accounting in the world"
- Administrative tasks
- Basic compliance functions

**Elastic (unlimited expansion potential):**
- Software development - "There's just unlimited demand for the industry"
- Product management - "PMs that can now do so much more are going to be extremely well-positioned"
- Consulting - "Imagine if we could have 10x as many McKinsey consultants"
- Creative production
- Research and analysis

The key distinction: Does more productivity unlock more value creation, or does it simply mean fewer people doing the same work?

## How to Apply It

When evaluating career paths:

1. **Ask the elasticity question** - If everyone in this field became 10x more productive, would the industry need 10x more work done, or would it need 1/10th the people?

2. **Look for value creation, not value maintenance** - Elastic industries create new value; inelastic industries maintain existing processes

3. **Prioritize AI leverage** - "The companies and people that are going to succeed are those that lean into this narrative of abundance"

4. **Skill for augmentation** - "Use the tools and let's see what you can do" - develop skills in using AI, not competing with it

When evaluating companies to join:

1. **Assess their mindset** - Are they "fearful, not wanting to engage" or "leaning into" AI transformation?
2. **Look for abundance thinking** - Companies asking "If we can do 10 or 100 times more, what will that mean?"
3. **Avoid defensive postures** - Companies trying to "stop displacement" rather than "do so much more"

## When to Use It

- Choosing what to study or which skills to develop
- Evaluating job opportunities and industries to enter
- Advising younger people on career direction
- Deciding whether to reskill or double down on current expertise
- Assessing company strategy and culture fit
