# Baby Weights for Business

> "You don't want to walk into the gym on day one and try and deadlift 300 pounds. So when someone comes to me and they're a first time entrepreneur and they say, 'I'm going to make the next great AI company,' I think that is the equivalent." - Andrew Wilkinson

## What It Is

This framework uses a gym analogy to help first-time entrepreneurs choose appropriately sized business challenges. Just as you wouldn't attempt a 300-pound deadlift on day one at the gym, you shouldn't attempt a complex, highly competitive, regulated business as your first venture.

The key insight is that early entrepreneurial wins create a powerful narrative: "I'm good at business, I can do this, keep going." That narrative sustains you through later, harder challenges. Without it, most people give up after their first failure.

## How It Works

**Why simple businesses first:**
1. **Immediate feedback** - You quickly learn if you can do this
2. **Narrative building** - Success creates the belief that you can succeed
3. **Skill development** - You learn business fundamentals with lower stakes
4. **Capital preservation** - Less money at risk while learning
5. **Confidence for bigger bets** - Past wins fund emotional resilience for future losses

**The Progression:**
- Level 1: Service businesses (web design, consulting, coaching)
- Level 2: Simple product businesses with clear demand
- Level 3: Businesses requiring capital, teams, or complex operations
- Level 4: Highly competitive, regulated, or technology-intensive businesses

**Warning signs you're lifting too heavy:**
- First-time founder attempting to "build the next great AI company"
- Starting a bank or highly regulated business without industry experience
- Competing directly with venture-backed incumbents while bootstrapping
- Building something that requires 50+ people before generating revenue

## How to Apply It

1. **Assess your experience level** - How many businesses have you started? How many succeeded?

2. **Rate business difficulty factors:**
   - Competition intensity
   - Capital requirements
   - Regulatory complexity
   - Team size needed
   - Time to first revenue
   - Number of failure points

3. **Match difficulty to experience:**
   - First business: Minimize all difficulty factors
   - Second/third business: Add one or two complexity factors
   - Experienced: Take on harder challenges with capital and skills from prior wins

4. **Choose for early wins** - The first business should almost certainly work if you execute. Examples:
   - Consulting/services in your expertise area
   - Software solving a narrow, clear problem
   - Local service business with proven demand

5. **Build the muscle** - Use early wins to develop skills, capital, network, and confidence for bigger plays

## When to Use It

- When choosing your first business idea
- When mentoring first-time founders
- When evaluating if an opportunity matches your current capabilities
- When tempted by a glamorous but complex opportunity

## Examples from Andrew Wilkinson

**Good first business (simple, immediate feedback):**
- Web design agency (Metalab): "All I had to do was know how to build websites and be able to talk to potential customers... I got immediate positive feedback"

**Too complex for first-time (multiple failure points):**
- Pizzeria: "If the baker doesn't wake up at three in the morning and start prepping dough, the entire thing is effed"
- Bar: "We realized that we didn't know anything about business compared to someone who runs a pizzeria"
- Flow (Asana competitor): Lost $10M competing with venture-backed companies while bootstrapping
