# Transitions Framework

> "Once I learned about that transition framework, going through any subsequent changes myself became a lot easier to grasp." - Heidi Helfand

## What It Is

The Transitions Framework, from William Bridges' book "Transitions: Making Sense of Life's Changes," explains that every change involves three psychological phases that people must navigate. Understanding these phases helps leaders support their teams through change and helps individuals process their own transitions more effectively.

The key insight is that change (external) and transition (internal) are different. The external change may happen instantly, but the internal transition takes time as people process through these phases.

## How It Works

### The Three Phases

**1. Endings**
- Every transition begins with an ending
- You're letting go of the old way, old identity, old team
- This phase involves loss, grief, and disorientation
- People often want to skip this, but it's necessary

**2. Neutral Zone**
- The in-between period of liminality
- You're not in the old reality but not yet comfortable in the new one
- Feels uncertain, uncomfortable, and ambiguous
- This is where real transformation happens
- Creativity and new ideas often emerge here

**3. New Beginning**
- The arrival into the new reality
- New identity, new team, new way of working
- Leaders can accelerate this by painting a vision of the benefits and purpose
- Anchoring to purpose raises positivity

## How to Apply It

### For Leaders Managing Team Change:

1. **Acknowledge the ending**
   - Don't pretend the old way wasn't valuable
   - Give people space to grieve what's being lost
   - Celebrate what was accomplished before

2. **Support the neutral zone**
   - Normalize that discomfort is expected
   - Provide extra communication and clarity
   - Be patient—this phase can't be rushed
   - Create small wins to build momentum

3. **Paint the new beginning**
   - Articulate the vision and benefits of the new state
   - Anchor to purpose—"here's why we're here now"
   - Help people see themselves in the new reality
   - Celebrate early successes in the new structure

### For Individuals Going Through Change:

1. **Name the ending** - What are you actually leaving behind?
2. **Accept the neutral zone** - The discomfort is normal and temporary
3. **Look for the new beginning** - What becomes possible that wasn't before?

## When to Use It

- During any organizational restructuring or reorg
- When individuals are changing roles or teams
- During company pivots or strategic shifts
- When acquiring companies or merging teams
- For personal life transitions (job changes, relocations, etc.)
- When someone leaves the team and others must adjust

## The Difference Between Change and Transition

| Change | Transition |
|--------|------------|
| External, situational | Internal, psychological |
| Happens quickly | Takes time |
| Can be planned | Can only be supported |
| New org chart | New identity and relationships |
