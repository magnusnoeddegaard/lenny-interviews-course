# Mountain Climbing vs. River Floating

> "If you just relax and you instead pay attention to the signals around you, you feel where the current is trying to take you... If you really tune in with yourself and pay attention to that current and you relax into it, you'll arrive at a destination that you were meant for." - Andy Johns

## What It Is

Two fundamentally different approaches to navigating life and career. The mountain climbing approach treats life as a series of peaks to summit—goals to achieve, titles to earn, milestones to reach. The river floating approach involves surrendering control, paying attention to signals, and allowing life to carry you toward where you're meant to be.

Andy Johns spent 25 years in mountain climbing mode before realizing it was unsustainable. After leaving his tech career, he shifted to river floating—following signals and opportunities without forcing specific outcomes.

## How It Works

### Mountain Climbing Mode
This is the default approach for ambitious people:

**Characteristics:**
- Life as a series of peaks to conquer
- Clear goals and milestones
- Achievement as the path to fulfillment
- Assumption that reaching the top brings lasting satisfaction
- Intense effort, planning, and control

**The trap:** Once you summit one mountain, you immediately need another. There's no permanent satisfaction—only brief relief before the next climb. And the higher you climb, the more dangerous the falls.

> "The vast majority of people who die on Mount Everest actually die on the way down, not on the way up. You don't save anything for the return home."

### River Floating Mode
The alternative approach Andy discovered:

**Characteristics:**
- Surrender to the current instead of fighting it
- Pay attention to signals about where life wants to take you
- Trust that you'll end up somewhere meaningful
- Release the need to control outcomes
- Move toward what feels right, away from what doesn't

**The whitewater rafting lesson:** When you fall into rapids, the survival technique is to stop fighting. Go into "mummy mode"—lie back, cross arms, stick feet out—and let the current take you. Fighting the water is what gets people killed.

## How to Apply It

### If you're in Mountain Climbing mode:
1. **Check your fuel gauge** - How sustainable is your current pace? What's the cost to your health, relationships, and wellbeing?

2. **Question the summit** - What do you actually expect to feel when you reach your goal? Is there evidence from past achievements that this expectation is realistic?

3. **Notice what you're avoiding** - Often, relentless climbing is a way to avoid confronting something uncomfortable. What might that be?

### If you're transitioning to River Floating mode:
1. **Start listening to signals** - What is your body telling you? Your emotions? Where do you feel drawn? Where do you feel resistance?

2. **Practice small surrenders** - You don't have to make a dramatic change. Start by not forcing outcomes in small situations.

3. **Get comfortable with not knowing** - River floating means you won't always know where you're heading. That uncertainty is part of the approach.

4. **Notice the current** - Pay attention to what naturally energizes you, what people or opportunities appear, what feels like resistance vs. flow.

### The middle path:
You don't have to abandon goals entirely. The framework is about recognizing which mode you're in and whether it's serving you. Sometimes you need to climb; sometimes you need to float. Wisdom is knowing which mode the situation calls for.

## When to Use It

- When you've achieved goals but still feel unfulfilled
- When achievement has become compulsive rather than chosen
- When you're burned out but can't stop pushing
- When life presents unexpected opportunities or changes
- When you need to recover after a period of intense climbing
- When helping others understand different approaches to career and life
