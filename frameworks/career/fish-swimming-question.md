# Fish Swimming Question

> "What's something that a lot of people say you're good at, but you think it's not a big deal or it's not that important?... Imagine that you saw a fish and you were like, 'Hey, you're really good at swimming.' And then the fish would be like, 'Oh. Duh, doesn't everybody swim?'" - Jules Walter (via Lawrence Ripsher)

## What It Is

The Fish Swimming Question is a simple but powerful technique for identifying your true strengths. It works by flipping the typical approach: instead of looking for what you think you're good at, you look for what others consistently praise that you dismiss as unremarkable.

The insight is that your genuine strengths often feel so natural that you assume everyone has them. Like a fish that doesn't recognize swimming as a skill because it's effortless, your superpowers are often invisible to you precisely because they're so deeply embedded in how you operate.

Jules Walter learned this from his mentor Lawrence Ripsher, who used it to help Jules discover his own strengths of asking great questions, networking, and simplifying complex problems—all things Jules had dismissed as basic skills.

## How It Works

**The Core Question**

Ask yourself: "What's something that people keep telling me I'm good at, but I don't think is a big deal?"

**Signs You've Found a Strength**

- Others praise it, but you think "doesn't everybody do this?"
- It feels effortless to you
- You're confused why others struggle with it
- People repeatedly mention the same thing
- You've never invested in developing it—it just came naturally

**Why This Works**

Traditional strength assessments ask what you think you're good at. The problem is you tend to overvalue skills you had to work hard to develop and undervalue skills that came naturally. This question inverts the process by using others' observations as the signal.

## How to Apply It

1. **Collect the data** - Over the next few weeks, pay attention to compliments and positive feedback. What do people consistently mention? What themes recur?

2. **Note your dismissals** - When someone praises something, notice if your internal reaction is dismissive: "That's nothing special" or "Anyone can do that."

3. **Ask directly** - Reach out to 3-5 people who know you well (colleagues, managers, friends). Ask: "What do you think I'm unusually good at that I probably don't recognize myself?"

4. **Look for patterns** - What themes emerge across multiple people's observations? The strength is likely real if multiple people independently identify it.

5. **Dig deeper** - Once you identify a strength, ask: "Why am I good at this? What's the underlying resource or trait?" For Jules, being good at asking questions stemmed from deep curiosity. Understanding the root helps you apply it more broadly.

## Examples from Jules Walter

| What Others Said | Jules's Initial Reaction | The Reality |
|------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| "You're really good at networking" | "I'm semi-introverted, that can't be right" | Genuine strength |
| "You ask great questions" | "I ask basic questions" | Genuine strength |
| "You simplify complex things well" | "That's just how I think" | Genuine strength |
| "You're really curious" | "I don't think of myself as curious" | Underlying trait powering other strengths |

## When to Use It

- When feeling unsure about your value or differentiation
- During career planning or job transitions
- When seeking to understand what roles/projects suit you best
- As input for positioning yourself in interviews
- When building your personal brand
- When deciding what to delegate vs. keep

## Watch Out For

Once you identify a strength, understand its **shadow side**—the contexts where the same trait becomes a weakness. For Jules, asking questions without context could make him seem junior. Strengths and weaknesses are the same dial in different contexts (see: Strength-Shadow Connection).
