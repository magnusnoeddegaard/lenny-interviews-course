# Sponsors and Advocates

> "Mentors are great, don't get me wrong. But when I think about the people in my life, who the time that they donated to me, the time that they volunteered to me and for me, calling them mentors I think sells what they were very short. And I would actually describe those folks as being sponsors and advocates." - Christopher Miller

## What It Is

The Sponsors and Advocates framework distinguishes between mentors who give advice and sponsors who invest their own capital in your success. While mentors provide guidance, sponsors put their professional and social reputation on the line to create opportunities for you.

Miller credits sponsors - not just mentors - with accelerating his career. His manager Fareed Mosavat hired him despite a poor interview because he saw potential. This willingness to bet on someone and then invest in developing them is what separates sponsors from mentors.

## How It Works

### Mentors vs. Sponsors

| Mentors | Sponsors |
|---------|----------|
| Give advice | Take action on your behalf |
| Share wisdom | Stake reputation on you |
| Provide guidance | Create opportunities |
| Available when asked | Proactively advocate |
| Risk-free relationship | Risk their capital for you |

### Types of Capital Sponsors Invest
- **Professional capital**: Recommending you for roles/projects
- **Social capital**: Introducing you to their network
- **Political capital**: Advocating for your promotion
- **Time capital**: Deep investment in your development

## How to Apply It

### To Find Sponsors

1. **Be coachable** - Put ego aside and embrace not knowing things
2. **Take hard feedback well** - Show you can extract value from criticism
3. **Be hungry for growth** - Demonstrate desire to improve, not just advance
4. **Deliver results** - Sponsors need evidence their bet is paying off
5. **Be specific about what you need** - Make it easy for sponsors to help

### To Become a Sponsor

1. **Look for potential, not polish** - Hire/support people who could be great
2. **Invest time in development** - Go beyond advice to active coaching
3. **Create opportunities** - Use your position to open doors
4. **Take calculated risks** - Bet on people even when it's not obvious
5. **Stay invested** - Continue advocating as they grow

### Miller's Advice for Finding Sponsors

> "Finding people who are willing to invest in you is what really matters. When I think about true gasoline on the career fire, it's finding mentors, but it's also finding sponsors and advocates."

## When to Use It

Seek sponsors when:

- **Making career transitions**: Need someone to vouch for you in new domain
- **Breaking into new roles**: Someone to take a chance on you
- **Developing new skills**: Deep investment in your growth
- **Navigating politics**: Someone to advocate in rooms you're not in

Be a sponsor when:

- **You see untapped potential**: Someone is better than their resume shows
- **You can absorb risk**: Your position is secure enough to take chances
- **You've benefited from sponsors**: Pay it forward
