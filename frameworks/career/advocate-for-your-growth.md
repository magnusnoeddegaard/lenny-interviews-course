# Advocate for Your Growth

> "I would really like at some point in the future to grow into whatever this goal is... What do you suggest that I work on now so that I'll be ready when the opportunity comes up?" - Jackie Bavaro

## What It Is

Jackie Bavaro's template for starting the promotion conversation with your manager. The framework is designed to get your manager on your side as an ally in your growth, rather than putting them on the defensive about why you're not ready yet.

The key insight is that how you frame the conversation matters enormously. Ask the wrong way and you trigger defensiveness. Ask the right way and you create a collaborative relationship focused on getting you promoted.

## How It Works

### The Template

> "I would really like, at some point in the future, to grow into [goal]. What do you suggest that I work on now so that I'll be ready when the opportunity comes up?"

### Why Each Part Matters

**"At some point in the future"**
- Removes urgency and threat
- Manager doesn't have to defend current decisions
- Creates space for honest feedback

**"What do you suggest"**
- Brings them onto your side
- They become an advisor, not a gatekeeper
- Creates collaborative dynamic

**"So that I'll be ready when the opportunity comes up"**
- Acknowledges opportunity needs to exist
- Shows patience and understanding of constraints
- Frames as preparation, not demand

### The Alternative (What Not to Do)

"Why haven't I been promoted yet?"
- Puts manager on defensive
- Forces justification rather than help
- Creates adversarial dynamic

## How to Apply It

1. **Schedule a dedicated conversation** - Don't drop this into a random 1:1. Set aside time for a career conversation.

2. **State your goal clearly** - "Become a people manager" or "Reach senior PM" or "Move to a more strategic product area"

3. **Focus on what YOU can control** - Ask for feedback on skills and experiences you need, not timeline promises

4. **Take notes and follow up** - Treat their suggestions as actionable guidance. Circle back on progress.

5. **Use it at big companies with committee-based promotions** - If there's a promotion committee, also find someone on your manager's peer level who has successfully gotten people promoted. Ask them the same question.

6. **Filter the feedback** - A lot of feedback you get as a PM is true but not relevant to promotion. This conversation helps focus on what actually matters for your next level.

## When to Use It

- When you're clear on your next career goal
- At natural career discussion points (performance review seasons)
- When you've been in role long enough to have a track record
- When you feel stuck or unclear on what's holding you back
- At any level—APM to senior PM to director

## What to Expect

Your manager should give you specific areas to develop. If they can't articulate what's missing, that's valuable information too—either the path isn't clear to them, or you may be closer than you think.

Good responses include:
- "I'd like to see you lead a more ambiguous project"
- "You need more experience influencing senior stakeholders"
- "Work on synthesizing complex data into clear recommendations"

Vague responses ("just keep doing what you're doing") may mean:
- They haven't thought about it
- There's no clear path at this company
- You need to dig deeper or ask someone else
