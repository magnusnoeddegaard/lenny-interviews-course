# Flexible Identity

> "I think of myself as a builder and I like to build products... I'm a huge believer in the confluence of technology and capitalism to produce just incredible outcomes for customers." - Bret Taylor

## What It Is

A principle for career success that involves maintaining a loose, adaptable view of your professional identity rather than rigidly defining yourself by your current role or expertise. Instead of saying "I'm an engineer" or "I'm a product manager," think of yourself as a builder or problem-solver who can transform into what the situation requires.

Bret Taylor has worn many hats: engineer, product manager, CTO, CPO, COO, CEO, board chairman. People from different parts of his career think of him differently—Googlers see him as a product person, Facebook colleagues see him as an engineer, Salesforce employees see him as an executive. His success came from not having such an "ossified view" of his identity that he couldn't transform into what the company needed.

## How It Works

**The constraint of rigid identity**

When you strongly identify as "an engineer" or "a product person," you unconsciously:
- Conform your job to activities you prefer
- Solve all problems with your familiar tools
- Resist doing work that doesn't match your self-image
- Miss opportunities that require different skills

**The freedom of flexible identity**

When you hold your identity loosely, you can:
- Transform into what the company needs at each stage
- Find satisfaction in impact rather than specific activities
- Develop new skills without identity conflict
- Take on roles you never imagined

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify at a higher level** - Instead of "I'm an engineer," try "I'm a builder" or "I solve problems." Instead of "I'm in marketing," try "I help companies grow."

2. **Question role resistance** - When you resist certain work ("that's not my job"), ask if it's a legitimate boundary or an identity constraint.

3. **Follow the impact** - Let the work that creates the most impact define your activities, not your job title.

4. **Develop range** - Intentionally build skills outside your primary domain. Founders need to sell investors, candidates, and customers; they need design taste, engineering judgment, and business acumen.

5. **Embrace role fluidity** - As companies scale, what they need from you changes. The skills that made you successful at stage one may not be what's needed at stage three.

## When to Use It

- When starting or scaling a company (founders must wear many hats)
- When transitioning to a new role or level
- When your current skills aren't producing results
- When evaluating career opportunities
- When feeling stuck or typecast

## The Founder Context

This framework is especially critical for founders:

- **Day one**: You might code, design, sell, recruit, and handle customer support
- **Growth stage**: You might focus more on hiring, culture, and strategy
- **Scale stage**: You might become a public face, board manager, and executive leader

If you can't let go of your original identity ("I'm the technical founder"), you'll limit the company's growth.
