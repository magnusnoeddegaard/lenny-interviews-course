# Outcome-Driven Learning

> "When I'm trying to learn something new, I try to think about what is an outcome that I could drive. And if I drive this outcome, it will be proof that I'm better at this thing." - Jules Walter

## What It Is

Outcome-Driven Learning is a systematic approach to skill development that starts with a concrete, measurable outcome rather than abstract learning goals. Instead of "I want to learn growth," you define "Within six months, I want to ship experiments that improve activation by X percent."

The method then works backwards: identify the questions you need answered, find the best experts in the field, get their frameworks, apply them to your real work, iterate with feedback, and repeat. The outcome provides both motivation and validation that you've actually developed the skill.

Jules Walter used this approach to go from knowing "literally nothing about growth" to driving double-digit activation improvements at Slack within six months—by defining a clear outcome and systematically working with experts like Bangaly Kaba to fill knowledge gaps.

## How It Works

**The Five-Step Process**

1. **Define the Outcome** - Set a specific, measurable result that proves skill development
2. **Identify Questions** - List the questions you'd need answered to achieve the outcome
3. **Find Experts** - Identify the best people in the field who can answer those questions
4. **Apply and Iterate** - Use their frameworks on your real work, get results
5. **Circle Back** - Return to experts with results and new questions

**Why Outcomes Matter**

- Creates urgency and forcing function
- Provides clear validation of progress
- Grounds learning in real application
- Prevents endless "learning" without doing

## How to Apply It

### Step 1: Define the Outcome

Make it:
- **Specific**: Not "learn strategy" but "create a strategy doc that gets exec approval"
- **Time-bound**: "Within six months..."
- **Verifiable**: You'll know if you achieved it or not
- **Challenging but achievable**: Stretch yourself

| Vague Goal | Concrete Outcome |
|------------|-----------------|
| Learn growth | Ship experiments that improve activation by 10% in 6 months |
| Get better at strategy | Write a strategy that gets approved and funded |
| Improve communication | Present to execs and receive positive feedback |
| Learn monetization | Drive revenue increase of X% through pricing changes |

### Step 2: Identify Questions

Jules describes his process: "I have a sense of the kind of question that, if I were to answer them, I'd be able to drive the outcome."

For learning growth at Slack, his questions were:
- What frameworks exist for driving activation?
- What are best practices for new user onboarding?
- What have other companies done successfully?
- How do I identify the biggest opportunities?

Read a little about the topic first—not a lot, just enough to ask better questions.

### Step 3: Find the Best Experts

Ask: "What company defined excellence in this area? Who are the people I can reach out to?"

For Jules learning growth:
- "What company defined growth?" → Facebook
- "Who does growth there that I could reach out to?" → Bangaly Kaba, Adriel Frederick

Then use the [Smallest Ask First](smallest-ask-first.md) approach to engage them.

### Step 4: Apply and Iterate

Don't just collect advice—apply it immediately to your real work:

Jules's process at Slack:
1. Learned "Understand, Identify, Execute" framework from Bangaly
2. Applied it: "Let me call the user researcher—can we study people signing up for Slack?"
3. Looked at data: "What correlates with activation?"
4. Ran experiments based on insights
5. Shipped changes that moved metrics

### Step 5: Circle Back

Return to your experts with:
- Results from applying their advice
- What worked and what didn't
- New questions that emerged

Jules: "After I go through a loop where I actually see results, whether they're good or bad, I go back to the mentor and I'm like, 'Hey, I did this. It was actually successful. Thanks a lot. Now I'm thinking about this other problem.'"

This creates an ongoing learning relationship.

## Time Investment Framework

Jules recommends focusing on one skill at a time for 3-6 months:

**For IQ Skills (execution, strategy, product sense)**
- Read one relevant document/artifact per week
- Spend 1 hour/day practicing toward your outcome
- Within 3-6 months, you'll see clear progress

**For EQ Skills (communication, leadership, management)**
- Takes longer—often years of continuous work
- Progress is less linear; requires ongoing practice
- More like "building muscles"—stop practicing, they atrophy

## When to Use It

- Starting a new role and need to ramp quickly
- Received feedback to develop a specific skill
- Switching domains (e.g., from product to growth)
- Taking on expanded scope requiring new capabilities

## Contrast with Typical Approaches

| Typical Approach | Outcome-Driven Learning |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Read articles, save insights | Define outcome, apply immediately |
| Take courses, get certificates | Learn through real work application |
| Learn broadly, hope it's useful | Target specific skill gap |
| Learn alone | Systematically engage experts |
| No clear measure of progress | Outcome proves skill developed |
