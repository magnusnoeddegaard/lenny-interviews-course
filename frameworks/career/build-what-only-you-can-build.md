# Build What Only You Can Build

> "Build the one thing only you could build, a thing that wouldn't exist without the insight and expertise that only you have." - Edwin Chen

## What It Is

This framework rejects the Silicon Valley playbook of rapid pivoting and trend-chasing in favor of deep focus on a unique vision. Instead of constantly searching for product-market fit by pivoting every few weeks, founders should identify the specific problem that their unique background, expertise, and insight positions them to solve—and then commit to it completely.

The framework emerges from Edwin Chen's observation that many founders chase trends without consistency or mission. "Some founder who was doing crypto in 2020, and then pivoted to NFTs in 2022, and now they're an AI company. There's no consistency, there's no mission, they're just chasing valuations."

The approach is predicated on the idea that startups should be "a way of taking big risks to build something that you really believe in." If you're constantly pivoting, you're not taking risks—you're trying to make a quick buck.

## How It Works

**The Anti-Pivot Philosophy:**
Rather than treating pivoting as a feature, this framework treats it as a bug. When things get hard, resist the urge to pivot. If you fail because the market isn't ready, that's better than succeeding with something generic.

**Unique Insight Identification:**
Every founder has a unique combination of:
- Background and experiences
- Expertise and skills
- Interests and passions
- Insights and perspectives

The intersection of these creates a space where only you can build certain things.

**Destiny Thinking:**
Think of your company as a destiny that your entire life has been shaping you toward. What problem exists in the world that your specific journey has prepared you to solve?

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your unique advantages** - What do you know or see that others don't? What has your career taught you that creates differentiated insight?

2. **Say no to everything else** - Once you identify your unique thing, ruthlessly decline opportunities that distract from it.

3. **Commit through difficulty** - When challenges arise, double down rather than pivot. The market not being ready yet is better than abandoning your vision.

4. **Resist trend-chasing** - If your idea isn't the current hot thing, that might be a feature. "The only way you build something that matters that's going to change the world is if you find a big idea you believe in and you say no to everything else."

5. **Let quality speak** - Instead of hype and fundraising, focus on building something "so good that it cut through all that noise."

## When to Use It

- When starting a company and deciding what to build
- When facing pressure to pivot toward trending opportunities
- When evaluating whether to continue with a struggling product
- When hiring: look for people who believe in the unique mission

## When NOT to Use It

- When you have clear evidence your thesis is fundamentally wrong (not just difficult)
- When external conditions have changed so dramatically that your insight is obsolete
- When you're confusing stubbornness with conviction
