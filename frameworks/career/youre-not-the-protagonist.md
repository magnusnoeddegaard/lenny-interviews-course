# You're Not the Protagonist

> "The big mistake that people make is they think that the game is all about getting what is inside their head and influencing the CEO, influencing the people around them to make it so... You kind of come up thinking you're the protagonist. But in the story of work, you are probably not the protagonist. You're not special." - Hilary Gridley

## What It Is

Early in our careers, we're rewarded for having great ideas, unique insights, and strong opinions. This creates a protagonist mindset: "I have the right answer, and my job is to convince everyone else."

But when you reach senior levels—especially when working directly with a CEO or founder—this mindset becomes counterproductive. The realization Hilary Gridley shares, learned from the former CPO of Coinbase: your job isn't to get your vision adopted. It's to understand the CEO's vision and figure out how to operationalize it in the best possible way.

This isn't about being a pushover or abandoning your judgment. It's about recognizing that in an organization with a clear leader, fighting to impose your vision creates friction that makes everyone less effective—including you.

## How It Works

**The protagonist trap:**
- You believe your unique perspective is the key insight
- You spend energy trying to influence decisions toward your view
- When decisions go another way, you feel frustrated and undervalued
- You look for holes to poke in others' reasoning
- You end up "making myself miserable and making myself pretty useless to the company"

**The supporting character mindset:**
- You seek to understand how the CEO/founder thinks
- You figure out how to operationalize their vision brilliantly
- You find where your unique skills and judgment add the most value
- You make the whole organization more effective
- You have more impact and less frustration

## How to Apply It

**Reframe your role:**

Instead of: "How do I convince leadership to see things my way?"
Ask: "How do I take this vision and create the best possible manifestation of it as product?"

**Find your contribution within their vision:**

There are thousands of decisions to make, millions of micro-moments where you can zig where others would zag. The CEO's vision doesn't specify all of this—it sets the direction. Your unique skills, taste, and judgment still matter enormously in execution.

> "So much of where my fulfillment comes from is from feeling like if somebody else were in this job, it would be done differently. Something about the product is different because I was the one who worked on it."

**Know where to push:**

Think of it like Jenga—feel for which pieces can move:
- Identify where leadership has strong opinions and deep expertise (don't fight here)
- Identify where there are gaps in their knowledge or uncertainty (contribute here)
- Find areas where your spiky skills fill genuine needs

**When you disagree:**

1. Go through the "what if I'm wrong" exercise genuinely
2. Try to understand what would have to be true for them to be right
3. If you still disagree, be candid but respectful
4. Separate your opinion from their rationale when communicating to your team
5. Give it your best effort even if you disagree—that's the only way to learn if they were right

> "I might still think I'm right. Let's find out. We're not going to find out if we are all squabbling about whether this is a good idea the whole time. The only way we're going to find out is if we give it the best shot that we have."

**For your team:**

When you need to cascade a decision you disagree with:
- Explain their rationale, not just the decision
- Be honest that you see it differently: "I'm not sure I would have done it this way"
- But commit: "They might be right. Let's find out by giving this our best effort."

## When to Use It

- Working directly with founders or CEOs
- Operating as a senior leader in a company with clear vision
- Any time you feel frustrated that "leadership doesn't get it"
- When you're spending more energy on internal politics than on execution

## The Counterbalance

This isn't about blind compliance:

1. **You have an obligation to advocate** - Build strong arguments for what you believe. Present your case with data and conviction.

2. **Know where you are in the journey** - If you haven't really tried to influence the decision yet, do that first. Don't start from "I have nothing to say here."

3. **You can always leave** - If you fundamentally disagree with the vision, the right answer might be finding a different company whose vision you believe in.

4. **Execution has massive latitude** - The vision is the destination. The route is full of decisions where your judgment matters.

> "It's not like 'just do whatever the boss says.' I think it's incredibly important to bring your skills and your talents and your perspective to the job. But I do think this idea of understanding how to build a shared mental model of everyone together—that definitionally cannot be defined by your own narrow perspective—actually just makes work a lot better for everybody."
