# Don't Be the Frog

> "If you take a frog and throw it in a pot of boiling water, it'll jump out. But if you take a frog and put it in a pot and increase the temperature degree by degree by degree, the frog doesn't notice and before it knows, it's boiled alive." - Ada Chen Rekhi

## What It Is

"Don't Be the Frog" is a heuristic for career decisions based on the boiling frog parable. It warns against the danger of inertia—staying in a deteriorating situation because each individual change is too small to trigger action.

The framework helps you answer one of the hardest career questions: **How long should I stick with something that doesn't feel good but might lead to something great?**

## How It Works

### The Frog Trap

It's easy to be a victim of inertia when:
- Little things make you uncomfortable, but you sit with them
- You think "it'll get better"
- You're always "one conversation or one promotion away" from things improving
- The problems accumulated gradually, so no single issue seems worth leaving over

### The Key Question

Instead of asking "is this bad enough to leave?", ask: **Which way is the temperature trending?**

- Is your situation getting better or worse over time?
- Are the small discomforts accumulating or resolving?
- Is your learning increasing or plateauing?

### The Learning Lens

Ada looks at this through the lens of learning and growth:

**Arguments to STAY:**
- You're being challenged every day
- You're learning new things
- You're deriving meaningful enjoyment from work
- The "temperature" is stable or cooling

**Signals to LEAVE (or change something):**
- You don't get along with the company thesis or direction
- Fundamental aspects of the role are limiting you
- You're not learning—even if you're providing value
- You've hit hard walls that won't move

## How to Apply It

1. **Take stock of your environment**
   - List what's uncomfortable or not working
   - When did each issue start? Is it getting better or worse?

2. **Track the temperature over time**
   - Monthly check-in: is my situation improving, stable, or declining?
   - Are the wins getting bigger or smaller?
   - Is my learning accelerating or slowing?

3. **If temperature is rising, don't boil**
   - First, try to change things internally (conversation with manager, new projects, different team)
   - If walls are hard, treat your extra capacity as a gift—use it to learn or build relationships
   - If nothing works, it's time to move

4. **If temperature is stable/cooling, stay**
   - You can be "a happy frog hanging out" for decades
   - Just keep monitoring

### Avoiding False Alarms

Not every discomfort means you should leave. The question isn't "am I uncomfortable?" but "where is this trending?"

- Single bad quarters happen
- Hard projects end
- Bad managers move on

The frog problem is about sustained, gradual deterioration you're not noticing.

## When to Use It

- **Feeling vaguely stuck** - Can't articulate why you're unhappy
- **Accumulating small frustrations** - No single big issue, but lots of small ones
- **"It'll get better" mindset** - You keep waiting for improvement that doesn't come
- **Long tenure without growth** - You're good at your job but not learning

## The Catastrophe to Avoid

Ada describes the worst outcome: waking up late in your career, trapped by lifestyle expectations and others' expectations, looking in the mirror and realizing you're not happy going to work.

This happens when you let the temperature rise degree by degree without noticing.
