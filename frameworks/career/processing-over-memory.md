# Processing Over Memory

> "I try to create or free up headspace for processing, not memory. And so I just basically spend very little time memorizing anything and I write everything down." - Geoff Charles

## What It Is

Processing Over Memory is a personal productivity philosophy that prioritizes cognitive capacity for thinking over storing information. The insight is that your brain is excellent at processing and synthesizing—but using it for memory wastes that capacity.

For managers in back-to-back meetings from 10 AM to 6 PM, the sheer volume of inputs is overwhelming. Trying to remember everything crowds out the space needed for actual thinking. The solution is a simple but rigorous task management system that externalizes everything so you can focus on what matters: processing, synthesizing, and making decisions.

## How It Works

**The system has three parts:**

**1. Capture immediately**
At the end of every meeting, write down:
- Tasks you owe
- Tasks someone else owes you
- Deadlines for each

Write them clearly and specifically—not vague descriptions, but concrete actions.

**2. Groom regularly**
At the end of the day, organize your notes:
- Group by logical chunks
- Separate tactical from strategic
- Sort important from less important
- Create separate tracking for what others owe you

**3. Externalize follow-ups**
For tasks others owe you:
- Slack them what they owe
- Set a Slack reminder for the deadline
- It's now "out of sight, out of mind" until the reminder fires

**The tool stack:**
- Apple Notes for capturing and grooming (simple, always available)
- Slack reminders for tracking what others owe
- Google Docs for searchable retrieval of longer-form thinking

## How to Apply It

**1. Invest in capture discipline**
Every meeting ends with you writing down commitments. This is non-negotiable. The cost of not capturing is much higher than the seconds spent writing.

**2. Group for execution**
Don't just create a flat list. Group tactical tasks that can be batched. Separate strategic thinking time. "I would basically spend time grooming, which is basically just trying to group things together in logical chunks."

**3. Create calendar alignment**
Plan tomorrow based on today's grooming. Block time aligned to the groups: tactical batch here, strategic deep work there.

**4. Use technology for follow-up, not memory**
"I Slack them what they owe me and I put a reminder on Slack for when they owe it to me by. And that way, it's just out of sight, out of mind."

**5. Accept you won't remember**
"It is hard when you're trying to remember a specific date or remember something that someone said, but you have a system by which you can pull these things up very, very quickly."

## When to Use It

- When your calendar is packed with meetings
- When you feel overwhelmed by the volume of inputs
- When you're dropping balls or forgetting commitments
- When you want to think more clearly but don't have cognitive room

## The Trade-off

This system requires discipline in the moment—you have to capture immediately. But it pays off by freeing your mind for what matters most: thinking through hard problems, synthesizing information, and making decisions.
