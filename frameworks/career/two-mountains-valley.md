# Two Mountains and a Valley

> "That first mountain in his life when he got off of that mountain and he entered this valley, between the first mountain of life and the second mountain of life, the valley that he was in that sat between the old sense of self and then this new sense of self... that valley was seven years for him." - Andy Johns (describing Eckhart Tolle's journey)

## What It Is

A metaphor for understanding major life transitions that involve fundamental identity change. Unlike career pivots or job changes (which happen on the same mountain), this framework describes what happens when someone's entire sense of self needs to transform.

The first mountain represents your established identity—the person you've spent years or decades becoming. The valley is the difficult transition period where the old self dissolves but the new self hasn't yet formed. The second mountain is your new identity and purpose.

Andy Johns used this framework to understand his own seven-year transition from high-powered tech executive to mental health advocate.

## How It Works

### The First Mountain
This is your established life: career trajectory, relationships, identity, beliefs about yourself. For many high achievers, this mountain is built on external validation—success metrics, titles, compensation, status.

The climb up this mountain often involves:
- Pursuing achievement as a path to self-worth
- Building an identity around professional success
- Accumulating accomplishments that look impressive but may feel hollow
- Developing adaptations that served you earlier but now cause problems

### The Descent / Entering the Valley
Something triggers the transition—often burnout, health crisis, relationship collapse, or profound emptiness despite success. You realize the first mountain isn't where you belong anymore.

> "It's been the death of the old me, the death of Andy whose identity was entirely attached to succeeding, and that old Andy doesn't want to let go."

This descent is terrifying because:
- You're leaving behind a known identity
- Your ego fights to preserve itself
- Others may not understand your choice
- Financial and social costs can be high

### The Valley
The hardest part. You're no longer who you were, but you don't yet know who you'll become. This period typically lasts years (7+ years in multiple examples Andy cites including Buddha, Eckhart Tolle, and Pema Chodron).

The valley involves:
- Seeking truth about why you are the way you are
- Processing old pain and trauma
- Practicing self-compassion
- Feeling untethered and uncertain
- Gradual emergence of new direction

### The Second Mountain
Eventually, a new identity crystallizes. This isn't chosen through analysis—it emerges through the work done in the valley. For Andy Johns, the second mountain became mental health advocacy. For Eckhart Tolle, spiritual teaching. For Pema Chodron, becoming a Buddhist nun.

## How to Apply It

1. **Recognize which phase you're in** - Are you climbing the first mountain, beginning your descent, in the valley, or ascending the second? Each phase requires different approaches.

2. **Don't rush the valley** - The transition period takes time. Trying to shortcut it leads back to the first mountain. Seven years is a common timeframe for major identity shifts.

3. **Accept not knowing** - In the valley, you won't have clear direction. That's normal. The second mountain reveals itself through the process, not planning.

4. **Find guides who've made the crossing** - Seek out people who've successfully navigated similar transitions. Their presence proves it's possible.

5. **Expect resistance from your old identity** - Your ego will fight to preserve itself. Recognize this as a survival mechanism, not truth.

## When to Use It

- When you've achieved external success but feel increasingly empty
- When you're facing a major life crisis that challenges your identity
- When micro-adjustments (new job, new city) aren't addressing deeper dissatisfaction
- When helping others understand why major transitions take so long
- When you need patience with your own transformation process
