# Memento Mori

> "Not to be morbid, but most of us just aren't really tuned into an awareness that our lives will come to an end. We try to pretend like we're going to live forever and just not think about it. And the horror of it is that we succeed." - JM Nickels

## What It Is

Memento Mori is an ancient Stoic practice of remembering that you will die. JM Nickels applies this practice to modern life and work decisions, arguing that awareness of mortality is essential for proper prioritization.

The "horror" he describes is that we succeed in avoiding this awareness. We manage to go through life eating ice cream, going to work, taking vacations—without ever confronting that this will end. This avoidance enables endless deferral of what matters most.

When you truly internalize that your relationship with your daughter will come to an end, that you won't always have the chance to hug your children after work, it "punctuates reality in a way that requires me to rethink my priorities."

## How It Works

**The Default State:**
- We unconsciously assume we'll live forever
- We defer important things ("I'll spend time with family later")
- We prioritize urgent-but-unimportant over important-but-not-urgent
- Years pass and we've optimized for the wrong things

**The Awakening:**
- Awareness that life ends breaks the deferral pattern
- It creates urgency around what actually matters
- It reframes "I'll do it later" as potentially "I'll never do it"
- It makes each moment more precious

**The Application:**
- Before allocating time/energy, remember this is finite
- Consider: "If I only have X more years, how should I spend today?"
- The answer often differs dramatically from autopilot decisions

**Stoic Lineage:**
- Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, and other Stoics practiced this
- It's not morbid—it's clarifying
- Viktor Frankl applied it even in concentration camps
- "If he can do that in the face of those conditions, I can show up differently in a product review"

## How to Apply It

1. **Morning reflection** - Start the day with brief awareness that this day is finite. What matters most today?

2. **Before deferring** - When you think "I'll do it later," ask: "What if there is no later?"

3. **Relationship awareness** - Remember that time with loved ones is limited. This relationship, this journey, will come to an end.

4. **Decision moments** - When facing a choice, ask: "On my deathbed, which would I choose?"

5. **Stop wasting time** - "Stop wasting time on things that don't matter with people who matter."

## When to Use It

- When you're about to defer something important
- When work-life balance decisions arise
- When you're on autopilot and not deliberately choosing
- When you notice you're taking relationships for granted
- During annual life reviews or major crossroads
- When you're letting "urgent" crowd out "important"
