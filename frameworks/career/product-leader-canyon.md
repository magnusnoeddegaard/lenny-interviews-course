# Product Leader Canyon

> "This path from IC to more senior IC working on bigger problems... it's a relatively straightforward path. We just talked about some of the ways that you do that... But there's this canyon between IC and leader that many people fail to cross." - Fareed Mosavat

## What It Is

The Product Leader Canyon describes the challenging transition from senior individual contributor PM to product leader/manager. Unlike the earlier parts of the PM career path—which are about getting better at the same kind of work—this transition requires fundamentally different skills and mindsets.

Many PMs fail to make this transition because the skills that made them great ICs actively work against them as leaders. The canyon exists because success on one side doesn't predict success on the other.

## How It Works

### Why the Canyon Exists

As an IC PM, you succeed by:
- Getting deep in the details
- Doing the hard work yourself
- Being the expert on your product
- Partnering closely with your eng manager and designer
- Solving known problems with unknown solutions

As a leader, you must succeed by:
- Helping others get deep in the details
- Trusting others to do the hard work
- Building expertise across the team
- Orchestrating across multiple pods and functions
- Owning business outcomes, not just product delivery

The instincts that got you promoted are the opposite of what you need next.

### Three Traps in the Canyon

**Trap 1: The Manager Death Spiral**
You take the most interesting, high-leverage projects for yourself and leave the tedious work to your team. This overworks you, demotivates your team, and prevents them from growing.

**Trap 2: Staying in One Type of Product Work**
You became an expert in feature work, or growth work, or scaling work. Now you need to lead a portfolio across all four types. But you keep treating everything like your specialty.

**Trap 3: Resource Victim Mindset**
As an IC, you maximize output with the resources you're given. As a leader, you must propose what resources are needed to achieve the outcome. Many new leaders fail because they never ask for what they actually need.

## How to Cross the Canyon

1. **Shift from doer to editor:** Your job is no longer to do the work—it's to make others' work better. Ask "What's the minimum I can do to maximize this?"

2. **Trust your team with interesting work:** Yes, it's painful. Yes, they might do it differently. This is the only way they grow and the only way you scale.

3. **Learn the four types of product work:** Develop baseline competence in feature work, growth work, PMF expansion, and scaling work—even if you came from just one.

4. **Own the outcome, not the resources:** Your job is to propose what's needed to achieve the business goal, not to maximize what you can do with what you have.

5. **Partner cross-functionally:** Your scope now includes influencing marketing, sales, data, finance—not just your direct team.

## The Scope Expansion

The canyon is really about three types of scope expansion:

1. **Scope of product work types:** From specialist to portfolio leader
2. **Scope of resources:** From taking what you're given to proposing what you need
3. **Scope of influence:** From your pod to cross-functional partners

> "Now you have moved to owning the impact. As a leader, you now own the business outcome, the impact, the delivery, not some sub-problem or known answer."

## When to Use It

- When evaluating whether you're ready for the transition to leader
- When struggling in your first leadership role
- When coaching PMs who want to become leaders
- When diagnosing why a PM leader is struggling
