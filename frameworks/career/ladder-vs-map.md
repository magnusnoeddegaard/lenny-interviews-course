# Ladder vs Map Career Thinking

> "Ladder is about moving up. It's more influence, more power, a higher title, things like this, whereas map is I just want to go wherever's interesting. I literally think of my career very similar to travel." - Jason Shah

## What It Is

Ladder vs Map is a framework for thinking about career decisions. You can be either type of person at any point in your life, but understanding which mode you're in helps clarify decisions.

**Ladder thinking** is about moving up: more influence, more power, higher titles, more compensation. It's a vertical progression within a relatively defined path.

**Map thinking** is about exploration: going wherever is interesting, being willing to accept discomfort because it leads to growth, stories, and memorable experiences. It treats a career like travel rather than a promotion track.

Jason Shah describes his own approach: "I care more about living a really interesting life than let's say a good or comfortable life. I think that's where the growth comes from. That's where the stories come from. That's the things that I'll remember the most."

## How It Works

The map mindset reframes career decisions around long-term significance rather than short-term optimization:

**The Deathbed Test**: "When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to care about the products I built and how they affected people. Nobody's really going to be looking at my LinkedIn, hopefully for their sake and mine."

**Comfort with Discomfort**: Like travel, interesting careers involve getting lost, facing challenges, and being uncomfortable. These experiences build character and create stories.

**Long Time Horizon**: Most people have 30-40 years of career ahead of them. That's a lot of chips to play. You could do five 10-year rounds of very different work.

**False Precision Problem**: People have false precision about what career moves will lead to. We make decisions based on maybe 10 hours of talking to a team. The ladder often falls over—if all your hopes are pinned on one ladder, it's very fragile.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your current mode** - Are you optimizing for the next title and salary (ladder) or following what's genuinely interesting (map)?

2. **Use the future perspective test** - What will you care about 20 years from now? Products you built? People you helped? Or your job title progression?

3. **Evaluate "risk" through a map lens** - What seems risky to ladder-thinkers (taking a step back in title, joining an unproven company) might be inevitable to map-thinkers following their interests.

4. **Remember you can explore and commit** - Map thinking doesn't mean job-hopping every few months. You can stay at companies for 5-10 years while still following an exploration mindset across your whole career.

5. **Consider what makes stories** - Career decisions that seem safe often make boring stories. Discomfort, challenges, and unexpected turns often make the best ones.

## When to Use It

- When evaluating job offers that differ in prestige vs. interest
- When feeling stuck between "sensible" career advice and genuine curiosity
- When someone says a career move is "risky"
- When you're optimizing for the micro (next job) but being unintentional about the macro (life arc)
- At major career transitions where you could play it safe or follow curiosity

## Examples

Jason Shah shares several examples from his own career:

**Moving to San Francisco with no job**: After selling his first company, he could have gotten a "great entry-level job" like his peers at Google. Instead, he worked from his dining table building products, eventually chasing down Ron Conway on the street to pitch ideas.

**Leaving Yammer after Microsoft acquisition**: His equity was finally worth something and he could have learned from Microsoft's structure, but he was bored and excited about starting something new.

**The startup years at do.com**: "It was a really stressful four years" with challenges like an M&A offer falling through the day before his wedding, or app store crashes on Memorial Day weekend. "Using the map analogy, that's like getting lost in Croatia...These are interesting experiences that build character."
