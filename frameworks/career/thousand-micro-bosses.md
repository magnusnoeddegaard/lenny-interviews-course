# Thousand Micro-Bosses

> "Instead of one boss, I have thousands of micro bosses, and one of them can fire me and many do every day, but it feels safer than at a tech job where one person can decide." - Lenny Rachitsky, with Gergely's agreement

## What It Is

When you work for an employer, your livelihood depends on a single decision-maker who can eliminate your income with one decision. When you run a subscription business with many customers, no single customer has that power. Even though customers leave daily ("fire you"), the distributed nature of the risk makes it feel—and often be—more secure.

This mental model helps creators and entrepreneurs understand why leaving a high-paying job for a seemingly riskier path can actually reduce career risk.

## How It Works

**Traditional Employment Risk:**
- One boss, one company, one income stream
- Layoff decision eliminates 100% of income instantly
- Career control concentrated in others' hands
- No matter how good you are, you can be cut (wrong team, reorg, etc.)

**Distributed Customer Risk:**
- Hundreds or thousands of paying customers
- Churn is constant but predictable
- No single customer loss is catastrophic
- Revenue correlates more directly with your output quality

**The Math:**
- Tech job: 1 boss can eliminate 100% of income
- Subscription business: 1% churn means 1% loss, not 100%

## How to Apply It

1. **Build a subscriber/customer base** - Many small customers, not few large ones
2. **Diversify within the base** - Don't let any single customer dominate revenue
3. **Track churn as normal** - Expect some customers to leave; it's not failure
4. **Value the control** - Your quality of work directly affects your income

Gergely's realization: "I saw some of my colleagues who were really good professionals, I'd argue they were better software engineers and managers than me, they got let go because they were in the wrong team."

## When to Use It

- Evaluating whether to leave a job for entrepreneurship
- Assessing the "safety" of corporate employment vs. creator life
- Building a business model that distributes risk
- Processing the anxiety of losing individual customers

## The Raise Corollary

Lenny adds a related insight: "Assuming it keeps growing, you're getting a raise almost every day, every week, depending on the growth rate."

With distributed customers:
- Good work → more customers → higher income
- The feedback loop is direct and continuous
- No waiting for annual reviews or budget cycles

Versus employment:
- Good work → maybe recognized → maybe promoted → maybe raise
- Feedback loop is slow and mediated by others

## Warnings

- Subscription businesses have their own concentration risks (platform dependency, single product)
- Building the initial customer base takes years
- The stress of "many bosses" is real—customer feedback is constant
- Not all distributed models are equal—one enterprise customer can create concentration risk

## The Psychological Shift

The transition isn't just financial—it's identity:

**Employee mindset**: "I could get laid off at any time"
**Entrepreneur mindset**: "Customers leave every day, and that's fine"

Both involve loss, but the distributed model makes the losses feel manageable rather than catastrophic.
