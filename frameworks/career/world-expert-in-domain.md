# World Expert in Your Domain

> "In product, you don't own a little feature, you own your product and you're expected to be the world's foremost expert in it. And if you are, what that means is instead of having to come back to people three days later with an answer, just off the top of your head, you can be like, 'Yes, this is what I think we should do about that.'" - Jeremy Henrickson

## What It Is

World Expert in Your Domain is the expectation that product leaders should have deep enough knowledge of their product area that they can answer most questions immediately rather than needing to "get back to you." This isn't about memorizing trivia—it's about having internalized the domain so thoroughly that you can reason about new situations in real-time.

This level of expertise comes from genuine curiosity, hands-on investigation, and consistent engagement with the details. It enables fast decision-making at scale because you don't have to wait for research or consultations for routine decisions.

The standard is high: you should be able to compete with anyone in the world on knowledge of your specific product domain. Not general product management—your specific domain.

## How It Works

Being a world expert manifests in several ways:

1. **Instant Response Capability**: When asked a question about your domain, you can give a substantive answer immediately, or say "give me 30 minutes" rather than "give me three days"

2. **Pattern Recognition**: You've seen enough variations that you can quickly categorize new situations and apply relevant mental models

3. **Edge Case Awareness**: You know the weird cases, the exceptions, the "what about when..." scenarios

4. **First Principles Reasoning**: When you encounter something new, you can reason from fundamentals rather than needing to research

**Time allocation**: If the job is 80 hours a week, 40 of those hours should be going deep on understanding your domain. You can't really understand a product unless you've gone there.

## How to Apply It

1. **Go to primary sources** - Read the actual regulations, documentation, code, and research. Don't rely on summaries or interpretations.

2. **Use your own product obsessively** - You should find bugs, frustrations, and opportunities through daily use, not just through reports

3. **Study adjacent domains** - Understand how your domain connects to related areas. A payments PM should understand banking, fraud, compliance, not just checkout UX.

4. **Talk to extreme users** - Your most demanding customers will teach you about edge cases you'd never discover otherwise

5. **Track competitive landscape continuously** - Know what every competitor is doing and why, not just quarterly updates

6. **Invest in learning infrastructure** - Set up alerts, reading lists, expert relationships that keep you informed automatically

7. **Accept that this takes time** - You can't shortcut to world-class expertise. It requires consistent investment over months and years.

## When to Use It

- As a career development strategy for product leaders
- As a hiring criterion for product roles
- As a cultural expectation that enables fast decision-making
- When building thin product organizations where each person owns a large scope
