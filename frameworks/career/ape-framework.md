# APE Framework

> "APE basically is an acronym which stands for awareness, posture, and emotion. So to kind of go through each one by one..." - Jonny Miller

## What It Is

The APE Framework is a simple interoception practice for developing your "sixth sense"—the ability to sense, track, and feel your internal landscape. Just as a chef trains their flavor palette for sweet, spicy, and umami, you can train your interoceptive palette to better detect internal states.

This framework helps you catch early warning signs of stress, make better decisions by accessing body-based wisdom, and regulate your nervous system before situations escalate.

## How It Works

**A - Awareness**
- Notice where your attention is focused
- Narrow awareness = focused but often activating/stressful
- Expanded awareness = calm and grounded
- Practice being aware of the space above, behind, and around you

**P - Posture**
- Your posture directly affects how you feel
- Hunched, closed postures signal threat to your nervous system
- Upright, open postures signal safety
- Check: Are shoulders tense? Is jaw clenched? How are you sitting?

**E - Emotion/Sensation**
- Map the landscape of sensation in your body
- Notice the overall mood or flavor you're feeling
- Track body-based sensations: heat, tightness, tingling, heaviness
- Many people have "blind spots" in their body awareness

## How to Apply It

1. **Morning ritual** - Do a 15-second APE check with your morning tea or coffee
2. **Before meetings** - Quick scan before important calls or presentations
3. **When triggered** - Use APE instead of immediately reacting
4. **During uncertainty** - Check in when something "feels off" to gather data
5. **After stressful events** - Notice what your body is holding

**The Check-In Process:**
- Awareness: "Is my attention narrow or expanded? Can I sense the space around me?"
- Posture: "How am I sitting/standing? Where is there tension?"
- Emotion: "What is the overall flavor I'm feeling? Where do I feel it in my body?"

## When to Use It

- Daily morning check-in before starting work
- Before jumping on Zoom calls or meetings
- When noticing racing thoughts or anxiety
- When intuition says something is "off"
- After difficult conversations
- When making important decisions
