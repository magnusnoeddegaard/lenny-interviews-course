# Explore and Exploit

> "Explore and exploit is really just around what mode you're in. You're either in a mode of exploring where you have a bunch of unknowns and you're testing to see whether or not you like it, how well it works, whether or not it fits for you. Or you're exploiting, where you actually have found something that's really rich and really deep and then you're just trying to get more." - Ada Chen Rekhi

## What It Is

Explore and Exploit is a career strategy framework borrowed from growth/optimization contexts. It helps you decide when to try new things (explore) versus go deeper on what's working (exploit).

The key insight: **early career should be almost entirely exploration.** You haven't experienced enough to know what you like, what you're good at, or what matters to you. But you explore with a thesis—each role should test specific hypotheses about what you want.

Ada Chen Rekhi used this framework to go from entry-level at Microsoft to SVP of Marketing at SurveyMonkey in just 7 years.

## How It Works

### Explore Mode
- Test hypotheses about what you like and don't like
- Optimize for variety of experiences
- Low stakes—you have little to lose early on
- Each role should teach you something specific

### Exploit Mode
- You've found something rich and deep
- Go deeper to extract maximum value
- Be intentional about what you're exploiting for
- Don't just follow the default promotion path

### The Transition
The question at each career stage: **Do I explore more, or do I exploit?**

Factors to consider:
- How much do you have to lose? (less = more exploring)
- Have you found something genuinely rich? (yes = consider exploiting)
- Are there still major unknowns about what you want? (yes = keep exploring)

## How to Apply It

### Early Career (Explore Mode)

1. **Form a hypothesis** before each role
   - "I think I'll like marketing" → take a marketing role
   - "I think I prefer small teams" → join a startup

2. **Extract learnings** from each experience
   - What did you love? Hate?
   - What surprised you?
   - What do you want to test next?

3. **Move on** once you've learned what you came to learn
   - Ada spent exactly 367 days at Microsoft—long enough to learn corporate life was too slow for her

### Mid-Career (Exploit Mode)

When you find something worth exploiting:

1. **Be explicit about your goals**
   - Ada told her LinkedIn manager: "I'm here to learn to be a better founder"
   - This isn't about title or compensation

2. **Design your role around learning**
   - Seek specific experiences you need
   - Ada targeted growth and subscriptions at LinkedIn

3. **Don't follow the default path**
   - The "obvious" next step (bigger team, bigger title) may not serve your goals
   - Intentionally choose experiences that build toward what you want

### Ada's Example Journey

| Role | Mode | Hypothesis Tested | Learning |
|------|------|------------------|----------|
| Microsoft AdCenter | Explore | Is corporate life for me? | No—too slow-paced |
| Mochi Media (startup) | Explore | Do I like marketing at startups? | Yes—loved it |
| Connected (founder) | Explore | Do I want to be a founder? | Yes, but need more skills |
| LinkedIn | Exploit | Learn growth + subscriptions | Got exactly what she needed |
| SurveyMonkey | Exploit | Apply all learnings | SVP role at 27-28 |

## When to Use It

- **Career planning** - Deciding whether to take a new role or go deeper
- **Feeling stuck** - Might signal you're in the wrong mode
- **Early career** - Default to exploring unless you've found something special
- **Post-exploration** - When you know what you want, shift to intentional exploitation

## Key Insight

The winning combination that got Ada her SVP role wasn't a perfect linear path—it was the unique intersection of:
- Startup founder experience
- Big company experience
- Growth experience
- Subscriptions experience
- Product marketing background

This came from intentional exploration, then intentional exploitation—not from following the default career ladder.
