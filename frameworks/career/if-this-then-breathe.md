# If This Then Breathe

> "If I feel overwhelmed, then I do the humming. If I feel anxious, then I do 4-4-8 breathing or alternate nostril breathing." - Jonny Miller

## What It Is

If This Then Breathe is a personal protocol system for building a toolkit of breathing practices matched to specific situations. Rather than trying to remember many techniques, you create simple if-then rules that become automatic responses to common states.

The framework recognizes that different contexts need different interventions—what calms anxiety isn't what creates energy, and what works in private isn't always practical in public.

## How It Works

**Build Your Personal Recipes**

| If This... | Then Breathe... |
|------------|-----------------|
| Feel overwhelmed | Humming |
| Feel anxious | 4-4-8 breathing |
| Need energy | Espresso breath |
| Can't sleep | Extended exhale breathing |
| Feel disconnected | Grounding + APE check |
| Before big meeting | 4-4-8 then physiological sigh |
| Afternoon slump | Espresso breath then 4-4-8 |

**Categories of Practice**

*Quick (5-30 seconds)*
- Physiological sigh (double inhale, long exhale)
- Humming
- Single 4-4-8 breath

*Medium (1-5 minutes)*
- Multiple rounds of 4-4-8
- Espresso breath
- Alternate nostril breathing

*Long (10-30 minutes)*
- NSDR practice
- Extended belly breathing
- Breathwork journeys

## How to Apply It

1. **Experiment first** - Try different practices and notice how each affects you
2. **Match to context** - Note which practices work in which situations
3. **Create your rules** - Write down your personal if-then statements
4. **Practice daily** - Morning practice builds the habit so you remember when stressed
5. **Refine over time** - Update your recipes as you learn what works

**The Daily Practice Rule:**
"By having a deliberate practice for at least 7 to 10 days so that you get the hang of it, then it feels much more natural to do it when you're feeling [stressed]. That's kind of like playing the game on hard mode when you are really stressed and anxious, that's when you need it the most, but it's also when you're least likely to remember to do it."

## When to Use It

- When building your personal stress-management system
- When you notice patterns in your stress responses
- When existing techniques aren't working
- When you want to make breathing practices automatic
- During personal development planning
