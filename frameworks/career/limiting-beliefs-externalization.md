# Limiting Beliefs Externalization

> "The first thing I would say about limiting beliefs is they're the most powerful and the most dangerous when you don't even know what they are. So when they're in the recesses of your subconscious mind... that's when the limiting beliefs are the most dangerous." - Graham Weaver

## What It Is

Limiting Beliefs Externalization is the practice of writing down the fears, doubts, and assumptions that are holding you back from pursuing your goals. Graham Weaver teaches that these beliefs are most powerful when they remain unexamined in your subconscious—bringing them into the light strips them of their power and transforms them into solvable problems.

The key insight: a fear that feels overwhelming in your mind often becomes a simple to-do item once written on paper.

## How It Works

### The Power of Unconscious Beliefs

Research suggests 95-98% of our thoughts are subconscious. Limiting beliefs hide in this space, influencing decisions without our awareness:

**Example of a trivial limiting belief:**
"I'm not funny" → You avoid situations requiring humor → You never develop comedic skills → You confirm the belief

**Example of a career-blocking limiting belief:**
"I can't start a nonprofit" → You never explore how → The fear compounds → Years pass without action

### The Two-Step Transformation

When you write down limiting beliefs:

**Step 1: Immediate Disempowerment**
"When you get it down on paper, it will almost immediately strip that limiting belief of a lot of its power and a lot of its scariness."

In your head: "I could never fund this"
On paper: "How would I fund this?"

The monster becomes smaller when you see it.

**Step 2: Fear → To-Do Conversion**
"A lot of that scariness becomes just a to-do item... In the recesses of your subconscious, that is a very scary, limiting belief that will actually keep you from doing the thing you love. Once it's on paper, now it's just a to-do item that you can actually deal with with your conscious mind."

| Subconscious Fear | Written Down | Becomes |
|-------------------|--------------|---------|
| "How would I pay myself?" | "Need to design a funding plan" | To-do item |
| "I don't know where to start" | "Need to research first steps" | To-do item |
| "I don't have the right experience" | "Need to identify skill gaps" | To-do item |
| "What if it fails?" | "Need to define acceptable failure conditions" | To-do item |

### Why This Works

You've overcome millions of obstacles in your life using your conscious mind. Limiting beliefs only stay powerful by hiding from conscious analysis. Once exposed:

- They become problems like any other
- Your problem-solving skills can engage
- The emotional charge diminishes
- Action becomes possible

## How to Apply It

### Step 1: Identify Your Genie Goal

First, know what you want. Use the [Genie Framework](./genie-framework.md) to identify the thing you would do if you knew you couldn't fail.

### Step 2: Write Every Fear Down

Take paper (physical is better than digital for this) and write every reason you can't do it:

- "I don't know how to start"
- "I don't have enough money"
- "I don't have the right connections"
- "My family wouldn't understand"
- "I'm too old/young"
- "The market is too competitive"
- "I don't have the credentials"
- "I might fail publicly"

Don't filter. Don't judge. Just capture everything.

### Step 3: Look at Them in the Cold Light of Day

Read each one back. Ask:
- Is this actually true?
- Is this a reason, or an excuse?
- Have other people overcome this same obstacle?
- What would someone who succeeded have done here?

### Step 4: Convert to Action Items

For each fear, ask: "What would I need to do to solve this?"

| Fear | Action Item |
|------|-------------|
| "I don't know how to fund it" | Research: 3 ways people fund nonprofits |
| "I don't have connections" | Schedule: 5 informational interviews this month |
| "I don't have the skills" | Identify: Top 3 skills to develop, find courses |

### Step 5: Address the Action Items

Now you have a list of practical problems. Solve them the way you'd solve any work problem—one step at a time.

## When to Use It

- **Before major career decisions** - Surface what's really holding you back
- **When stuck on a goal** - Uncover hidden fears blocking progress
- **When procrastinating** - Often a symptom of unexamined limiting beliefs
- **During coaching conversations** - Help others identify their blocks
- **Annually** - Review what beliefs are still limiting you

## Example from the Episode

A Brazilian student wanted to start a nonprofit to help underprivileged students access education. His limiting beliefs might have included:

- "I don't know how to start a nonprofit"
- "I have business school debt to pay"
- "I don't have a complete plan"
- "How would I get funding?"
- "This isn't what I'm supposed to do after an MBA"

Over the course of the class, "we just chipped away at all the fears and limiting beliefs of why he shouldn't or couldn't do that." By the end, he did exactly what he dreamed of.

## The Meta-Insight

Graham notes: "If you're listening to this podcast, you've overcome millions of obstacles in your life, and these are no different once they're down on paper."

The belief that these obstacles are insurmountable is itself a limiting belief. Once written down, it too loses power.
