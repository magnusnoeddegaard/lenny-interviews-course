# Seven-Minute Gratitude Practice

> "Seven minutes of gratitude with another person every day... coming from the feeling, not from the thought. If you have a full body sensation of gratitude and you experience that for seven minutes a day, it'll change your life dramatically really quickly." - Joe Hudson

## What It Is

The Seven-Minute Gratitude Practice is a daily exercise where you feel and express gratitude with another person for at least seven minutes. The key distinction is that it must come from felt sense, not thought—you savor the experience of gratitude rather than listing things you're grateful for.

Joe Hudson shares his personal story: while meditating 7-8 hours a day but worrying about money, he realized that billionaires also don't feel they have "enough." The meditation-and-worry pattern was giving him "the experience of a billionaire"—constantly feeling lack despite external circumstances. He decided to experiment: what if he focused on everything he did have instead of what he didn't?

Within three months, his credit card debt ($40,000) was gone. Within six months, he had $60,000 in the bank. He went from defining himself as someone who "didn't have" to someone who "did have." Looking out the window, he stopped seeing what he couldn't have and started seeing evidence of abundance everywhere—every lamppost represented 20 companies that made money.

## How It Works

**The practice:**
- Seven minutes minimum (can do more)
- With another person (call anyone: parent, sibling, friend, partner)
- Express gratitude back and forth
- Come from the FEELING of gratitude, not the thought
- Savor the full-body sensation

**What it's NOT:**
- Listing things you're grateful for ("I'm grateful for this, I'm grateful for that")
- Thinking about gratitude
- Solo journaling
- Quick acknowledgments

**The superpower level:**
- After a few weeks of general gratitude practice
- Apply gratitude to areas where you feel LACK
- Whatever you feel you don't have enough of (time, love, money)
- Gratitude for lack transforms your relationship with it

**Why it works:**
- You define yourself by what you focus on
- Focusing on lack creates the experience of lack (regardless of circumstances)
- Focusing on abundance creates the experience of abundance
- The shift changes behavior, which changes outcomes

## How to Apply It

1. **Find a partner** - Anyone you can call daily: family member, friend, colleague, partner

2. **Set the time** - Commit to seven minutes minimum

3. **Drop into feeling** - Before speaking, feel gratitude in your body. Let the sensation speak, not your mind.

4. **Go back and forth** - Share gratitude, listen to theirs, share again

5. **Start with what's easy** - Begin with obvious gratitude (health, relationships, basic needs)

6. **Progress to lack** - After establishing the practice, apply it to areas of perceived scarcity

## When to Use It

- Daily as a foundational practice
- When feeling scarcity around money, time, love, or anything else
- When noticing a mindset of "not enough"
- When working toward significant life changes
- As a shared practice with partners or close relationships
- When everything looks like what you don't have

## The Superpower: Gratitude for Lack

After establishing the basic practice, apply gratitude specifically to what you feel you lack:
- Feel lack of money? Practice gratitude for all the abundance around you
- Feel lack of time? Practice gratitude for time you do have
- Feel lack of love? Practice gratitude for connection that exists

This advanced application transforms not just your feelings about lack, but often the actual circumstances of lack.
