# AI-Native Advantage

> "Do you remember when you used to put Google search on as a skill on your resume? You were a person, you were good at Googling, because you grew up with Google. Being AI native and having your Iron Man suit on, and understanding how to leverage these tools is like young people are at a huge advantage." - Garrett Lord

## What It Is

AI-Native Advantage is the competitive edge that young professionals gain by growing up with AI tools as a natural part of their workflow. Just as people who grew up with the internet developed instinctive digital fluency, those who learn to work alongside AI from the start of their careers develop capabilities that feel foreign to those who must adapt later.

This isn't about technical AI expertise—it's about the comfort, intuition, and creative application that comes from treating AI as a default collaborator rather than an add-on tool to learn.

## How It Works

The advantage operates through several mechanisms:

**Tool Fluency**: AI-native workers don't just use AI tools; they think with them. They naturally decompose problems into tasks that AI can assist with, similar to how digital natives instinctively know when to Google something.

**Iron Man Suit Mentality**: Rather than seeing AI as replacement or threat, AI-native workers view it as capability amplification—like wearing an Iron Man suit that multiplies their abilities. One person can do the work of a small team.

**Multiplied Output**: An intern at Handshake submitted their first pull request the afternoon they started—something that would have taken days or weeks in the pre-AI era. The same person doing the same work produces dramatically more output.

**Cross-functional Capability**: The traditional division of labor breaks down. A social media marketer who is AI-native can create their own videos, produce creative assets, run analytics, and post across platforms—roles that previously required multiple specialists.

## How to Apply It

For young professionals:
1. **Treat AI tools as default** - Don't ask "should I use AI for this?" Ask "how would AI make this faster or better?"
2. **Invest in tool proficiency** - The gap between casual users and power users is enormous. Develop genuine expertise.
3. **Highlight AI productivity in interviews** - Your ability to ship faster with AI is a differentiator. Demonstrate it.

For employers:
1. **Recognize the productivity gap** - AI-native candidates may produce significantly more output than their experience level suggests.
2. **Update hiring criteria** - "5 years of experience" means something different when the candidate has been AI-augmented the whole time.
3. **Create environments where AI-native talent thrives** - Don't force them into AI-hostile workflows.

For everyone adapting:
1. **Learn from younger colleagues** - They have instincts worth observing.
2. **Don't dismiss the gap** - The fluency difference is real, similar to the gap between digital natives and digital immigrants.

## When to Use It

- When making career decisions as a young professional
- When hiring and wondering about candidate experience levels
- When evaluating job displacement fears
- When designing team structures and task allocation

## Example

Garrett Lord describes an intern's first day at Handshake:

> "An intern in our company, he had his first PR up I think the afternoon he started. You realize how challenging that would've been historically to get your dev environment set up and figure out where to add value."

The intern used AI tools to ramp up instantly—understanding the codebase, identifying a bug, and fixing it in hours rather than weeks. This isn't about the intern being exceptional; it's about AI-native work patterns becoming standard.
