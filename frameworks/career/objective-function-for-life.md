# Objective Function for Life

> "We have an objective function for our life. And then the problem is that a lot of us aren't conscious of it. It's just like an implied OF that you inherited values from your church or community or what your parents valued." - JM Nickels

## What It Is

The Objective Function for Life framework applies algorithmic thinking to life priorities. Just as algorithms are designed to optimize for specific objectives, we all have an implicit objective function that guides our decisions—but most of us never consciously examine or choose it.

The problem is that our implicit OF is often inherited from parents, culture, community, or workplace norms rather than deliberately chosen. This leads to optimizing for things that don't actually matter to us, or optimizing for short-term metrics (the presentation tomorrow) at the expense of long-term outcomes (relationships with our children).

JM Nickels, who designs marketplace algorithms at Uber, applies this same analytical rigor to his life: What are you actually optimizing for? Is that what you want to be optimizing for?

## How It Works

**The Problem: Unconscious Optimization**
- We inherit values from parents, church, culture, community
- These values go unexamined and drive our behavior
- We end up optimizing for others' priorities, not our own
- Type A achievers often over-index on short-term, visible wins

**The Insight: Think Like Future You**
- 5 years from now, you won't care about that slightly-better slide deck
- You will care about your relationship with your children
- Today's actions compound into tomorrow's outcomes
- The presentation is tonight; your daughter will "be here next week"—and suddenly years pass

**Clayton Christensen's Observation**
- Harvard MBA students become Fortune 500 execs
- Super successful professionally, but divorced with kids who hate them
- They consistently chose short-term work wins over long-term relationships
- Each individual decision seemed rational; the pattern was catastrophic

**The Solution: Get Conscious**
- Examine your implicit objective function
- Decide deliberately what you want to optimize for
- Use "future me" perspective to evaluate tradeoffs
- Remember that your life will end—what will matter then?

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your current OF** - Look at how you actually spend your time. What are you optimizing for in practice? Be honest.

2. **Apply the "future me" test** - For any decision, ask: "Five years from now, which choice will I be glad I made?" The answer often contradicts the short-term pressure.

3. **Use mortality as clarification** - Ask: "On my deathbed, will I wish I had worked more Sundays or spent more time with my kids?" Awareness of life's end clarifies priorities.

4. **Write down your values** - Like Ray Dalio's Principles, explicitly document what you want to optimize for. Make the implicit explicit.

5. **Check decisions against your OF** - Before major time/energy allocations, ask: "Does this align with what I've decided matters most?"

6. **Beware the hungry ghost** - No amount of promotions, money, or titles will ever be "enough" if you're looking for external validation to fill an internal void.

## When to Use It

- Sunday night when choosing between work and family
- When promotion pressure pushes you toward overwork
- At career crossroads (job changes, relocations)
- When you've achieved a goal and immediately feel empty
- During annual planning or life reviews
- When you notice you're on autopilot, not deliberately choosing
