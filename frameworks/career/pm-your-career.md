# PM Your Career Like a Product

> "A lot of the greatest PMs are the worst PMs of their careers. They love products. They love the craft. They love the customer research, the data. They have plans, they have timelines. And then when it comes to career, they have none of those things. They just drift from job to job." - Deb Liu

## What It Is

The PM Your Career framework applies product management discipline to career development. Just as great PMs create specs, define milestones, set metrics, and build roadmaps for products, they should apply the same rigor to their careers.

Most product managers are deeply intentional about their products but completely accidental about their careers. They drift from opportunity to opportunity, making serial decisions without a measuring stick. This framework challenges that by asking: If you had to write a spec for your career, what would be in it?

The key insight is that job opportunities come serially and often with time pressure—unlike college offers where you can compare options side by side. Having a clear career spec gives you a measuring stick to evaluate whether each opportunity gets you closer or further from your goals.

## How It Works

**The Career Spec should include:**

1. **Vision** - Where do you want to be in 5-10 years?
2. **Milestones** - What are the key stops along the way?
3. **Skills/Features** - What capabilities do you need to develop?
4. **Success Metrics** - How will you measure progress?
5. **Trade-offs** - What are you willing to sacrifice?

**The Serial Decision Problem:**

Unlike products where you can A/B test and compare options, career decisions come one at a time under pressure. Someone calls and says "I have an opportunity—decide in two weeks." Without a career spec, you have no way to evaluate if this moves you forward or sideways.

## How to Apply It

1. **Write your career spec** - Document what success looks like in 5 years, including the role, impact, skills, and lifestyle you want

2. **Define your milestones** - Break down the journey into achievable steps, just like product roadmap milestones

3. **Identify skill gaps** - List the "features" you need to build—leadership, technical skills, domain expertise

4. **Set career metrics** - Decide how you'll measure progress (not just titles, but learning, impact, relationships)

5. **Use the spec to evaluate opportunities** - When opportunities come, ask: "Does this get me closer or further from my goals?"

6. **Review and iterate** - Regularly update your career spec as you learn and as circumstances change

## When to Use It

- When evaluating a new job opportunity
- During annual career planning
- When feeling stuck or drifting in your career
- After a major career milestone or transition
- When mentoring others on career decisions
