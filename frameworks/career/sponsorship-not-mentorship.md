# Sponsorship Not Mentorship

> "I think of this as sponsorship, not mentorship. I don't necessarily find that in my career I've had a lot of managers where I'm like, 'Wow, their day-to-day help was super awesome at helping me be a better leader.' But what I do have is a couple examples of people who deeply trusted me to solve big problems." - Fareed Mosavat

## What It Is

Sponsorship Not Mentorship is a reframing of career advancement. While mentorship is valuable—someone who gives advice and helps you think through problems—the real inflection points in careers come from sponsors: people who bet on you by trusting you with opportunities beyond your current scope.

A mentor tells you how to succeed. A sponsor gives you the chance to succeed.

## How It Works

### Mentorship
- Provides advice and guidance
- Helps you think through problems
- Shares experience and wisdom
- Teaches you frameworks and approaches
- Available to many people

### Sponsorship
- Trusts you with significant opportunities
- Puts their reputation on the line for you
- Opens doors you couldn't open yourself
- Says "I believe this person can handle this"
- Requires them to believe you will deliver
- Rare and valuable

## Fareed's Examples

**At Conduit Labs (startup):**
> "One was a CEO of that startup who's now a venture capitalist. His name is Nabeel Hyatt. I was like, 'Hey, you seem to understand the data better than anybody here. You're solving these problems. Help us figure out what we're going to do next,' which now we call product management."

**At Slack:**
> "I was an ICPM working on activation and growth... people noticed that I knew what I was doing and gave me bigger and bigger opportunities. One of those was Merci Grace, who... was a wonderful sponsor for me. Then, again, when Merci left, April Underwood, who's the CPO, said, 'It seems like you have a handle on this. I'd like you to take on a bigger range of problems.'"

## How to Earn Sponsorship

1. **Execute exceptionally well:** Sponsors bet on people who deliver. You must demonstrate you can handle what you have before getting more.

2. **Communicate your work:** Nobody knows what you're doing unless you tell them. Share learnings, document wins, make your impact visible.

3. **Teach the organization:** Don't just move metrics—help others understand how things work. This creates leverage and builds trust.

4. **Work on important problems:** Position yourself on the top 4-5 most important things the company is working on. CEOs notice people working on what matters.

5. **Show broad understanding:** Demonstrate you understand not just your work, but how it connects to the business overall (see: Two Stack Levels Up, Two Stack Levels Down).

## The Trust Equation

> "It's what you do and that's multiplied by your ability to show that work and communicate it, and that's the impact that you can have. But you have to have not just impact on the customers, but also on the organization."

**Impact = (Work Quality × Communication) × Organizational Influence**

You need all three: doing great work, making it visible, AND changing how people think about problems.

## When to Use It

- When planning your career growth strategy
- When evaluating which relationships to invest in
- When wondering why good work isn't leading to promotion
- When deciding whether to change jobs (do you have sponsors there?)
