# Inner Board of Directors

> "I like to think of it a little bit as you got inner board directors, and there's some noisy, chatty voices that every so often sit in the chairperson's seat and start taking over. If you start to recognize, 'Wait, no, I'm the chairperson. I don't want to hear from you right now. We'll hear from you later,' it starts to create some power and you start to notice when it's happening." - Ken Norton

## What It Is

The Inner Board of Directors is a mental model for understanding and managing the different voices, critics, and parts within yourself. Rather than treating your inner critic or imposter thoughts as "you," you recognize them as board members who sometimes try to take over the chairperson's seat—your true self.

This concept comes from Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy, developed by psychologist Richard Schwartz, and is used extensively in executive coaching. It's also visualized in Pixar's *Inside Out*.

The key insight: your inner critic isn't you—it's a part of you that's trying to help (usually by protecting you from risk). When you can recognize it as a separate voice, you can choose whether to listen.

## How It Works

**The metaphor:**
- You have multiple "parts" or voices inside you (the inner critic, the perfectionist, the people-pleaser, etc.)
- Each part is like a board member with its own agenda
- Sometimes a noisy board member takes the chairperson's seat and starts running the meeting
- Your true self is the chairperson who gets to decide who speaks and when

**Why parts try to take over:**
- These voices developed to protect you at some point
- The inner critic wants to prevent you from taking risks that might hurt you
- The perfectionist wants to protect you from criticism
- The people-pleaser wants to ensure you're accepted

**The shift in power:**
When you recognize "That's just my inner critic speaking," you create distance. You're not dismissing the voice—you're just putting it in its proper place as one input among many, not the decision-maker.

## How to Apply It

1. **Name your parts** - Give your inner critic a name. Ken Norton's coaching clients often name and even visualize their parts. "Oh, there's Larry Loser again, telling me I'm not qualified."

2. **Recognize when a part takes over** - Notice when you're being driven by fear, perfectionism, or people-pleasing. That's a board member who's grabbed the chairperson's gavel.

3. **Reclaim the chair** - Say (internally): "Thanks for the input, but I'm the chairperson here. I'll take it under advisement." You're not fighting the voice—you're simply asserting your leadership.

4. **Understand each part's intention** - Your inner critic isn't evil. It's trying to protect you. Understanding this makes it easier to work with, not against, your parts.

5. **Give parts new jobs** - Sometimes you can redirect a part's energy. The perfectionist that's paralyzing you can become the quality checker who reviews work after you've shipped.

6. **Befriend, don't banish** - Trying to silence parts entirely often backfires. Acknowledge them, thank them for trying to help, and then redirect.

## When to Use It

Use this framework when:

- You're experiencing imposter syndrome
- Your inner critic is paralyzing you from taking action
- You're stuck in reactive patterns (people-pleasing, perfectionism, control)
- You need to make a decision but keep second-guessing yourself
- You want to understand why you react the way you do
