# Burnout Warning Signs (Fundamental Functions)

> "When their fundamental functions, when their core behaviors of diet, exercise, playfulness, socialization, sleep, when those things get disrupted, it's a sign that there is something going on here that you need to take a look at." - Andy Johns

## What It Is

A diagnostic framework for distinguishing normal work stress from dangerous burnout. Based on the observation that when animals are suffering, their fundamental biological and social functions break down first. The same applies to humans: chronic disruption to core functions signals that something is seriously wrong—even if you've convinced yourself everything is fine.

Andy Johns developed this framework after years of ignoring his own warning signs, including near-constant panic attacks, a heart attack scare at 35, severe teeth grinding requiring multiple dental reconstructions, and chronic sleep problems.

## How It Works

### The Core Functions to Monitor

**Sleep**
- Is your sleep consistently disrupted?
- Are you grinding your teeth (often only discovered at the dentist)?
- Do you wake up tired even after enough hours?
- Do you need substances to fall asleep or stay asleep?

**Physical Health**
- Heart problems, chest pain, elevated blood pressure?
- Chronic pain, tension, or physical symptoms without clear cause?
- Weight changes (significant gain or loss)?
- Immune system issues (getting sick frequently)?

**Relationships**
- Are your close relationships consistently strained?
- Have you withdrawn from friends and family?
- Do interactions feel like obligations rather than sources of energy?
- Are you present with people, or just physically there?

**Emotional Stability**
- Panic attacks, anxiety that won't quit?
- Depression or persistent low mood?
- Emotional reactions that feel disproportionate to situations?
- Numbness or inability to feel positive emotions?

**Core Behaviors**
- Exercise: Have you stopped or drastically changed your activity?
- Diet: Are you eating poorly, skipping meals, or using food to cope?
- Playfulness: When did you last do something fun without productive purpose?
- Socialization: Are you isolating or avoiding connection?

### The "Frog in Boiling Water" Dynamic

These breakdowns often happen gradually:
> "You don't realize how bad things are getting because it's happening to you slowly until it happens quickly."

You adapt to each new level of dysfunction until extreme becomes normal. That's why monitoring is essential—you can't trust your felt sense alone when you've been normalizing deterioration.

## How to Apply It

1. **Create a baseline** - When you're in a good state, document what normal looks like for sleep, relationships, health, and emotional stability.

2. **Check regularly** - Weekly or monthly, honestly assess each fundamental function. Use a simple 1-10 scale.

3. **Look for patterns** - Individual bad days or weeks happen. Consistent problems across multiple functions over months indicate burnout.

4. **Trust the body** - As Bessel van der Kolk writes in *The Body Keeps the Score*, the body is the scoreboard. Physical symptoms often appear before you consciously acknowledge stress.

5. **Take action early** - Addressing warning signs early is far easier than recovering from full burnout or health crisis.

### Red Flag Combinations

**Immediate attention required:**
- Sleep disruption + physical symptoms (especially heart-related)
- Multiple panic attacks + relationship withdrawal
- Grinding teeth + chronic illness + depression
- All core behaviors disrupted simultaneously

## When to Use It

- As a regular self-check (monthly or quarterly)
- When you notice one function starting to fail
- When people close to you express concern
- When you're pushing through a demanding period at work
- After major life changes or stressors
- When rationalizing that "it's not that bad"
