# Work at Category Leaders

> "I would much rather be the number two or number three person, if you think of it that way, in the leader in a space, than the top person. Say Google versus Yahoo. I saw even if you're the VP of product at Yahoo or the head of product at Yahoo versus a ICPM at Google, you probably want to be the ICPM at Google. I bet you all day long." - Gokul Rajaram

## What It Is

Work at Category Leaders is a counterintuitive career principle: take a lower-level role at the market leader rather than a higher-title role at a second-tier company. The benefits of association with a winner - talent network, brand halo, operational learning - compound far more than a title bump at a company that's fighting from behind.

Gokul demonstrated this in practice by convincing someone to take a step down in title to join Coinbase (category leader in crypto) rather than take a senior role at a tier-two e-commerce company. That person still thanks him.

## How It Works

### Why Category Leaders Win

**Quality of Talent:**
- Winners attract A-players who want to be around other A-players
- You learn from the best in every function
- Your network compounds with high-quality connections

**Brand Halo:**
- "You worked at [winner]? You must be good"
- Unfair but real attribution of company success to individuals
- Opens doors for future opportunities

**Operational Excellence:**
- See how things work at scale
- Learn systems and processes that work
- Understand what "good" looks like

**Network Effects:**
- Alumni networks of winners are more valuable
- Peers become founders, executives, investors
- References carry more weight

### The Tradeoff Is Worth It

Even significant title drops are worth it:

| Tier-Two Option | Category Leader Option | Take This One |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------|
| VP of Product | Senior PM | Senior PM at Leader |
| Head of Engineering | Engineering Manager | EM at Leader |
| Chief Marketing Officer | Marketing Director | Director at Leader |

### Long-Term vs Short-Term

**Short-term:** You might have more scope and authority at the smaller player

**Long-term:** The category leader gives you:
- Better stories for future opportunities
- Stronger reference network
- Deeper operational knowledge
- More respected brand on resume

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify the category leaders** - Not just well-known companies, but actual winners in their spaces

2. **Look beyond competitors** - Consider adjacent spaces where clear leaders exist

3. **Consider trajectory** - An emerging leader today may be the dominant one in 5 years

4. **Weight brand appropriately** - The halo effect is real and lasts for years

5. **Don't over-index on title** - Scope, learning, and company quality matter more

6. **Think about who you'll work with** - The people are the most durable asset

## When to Apply It

- Comparing offers between companies at different market positions
- Deciding whether to stay at a struggling company vs. move
- Evaluating step-down opportunities at stronger companies
- Early-mid career when building skills and reputation

## When Title Matters More

Title may be more important when:
- You need a specific title for external credibility (e.g., VP for certain sales conversations)
- You're late career and title reflects earned authority
- The category leader has serious cultural or ethical problems
- The "smaller" company is actually a future category leader
