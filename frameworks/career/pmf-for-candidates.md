# PMF for Candidates (People, Mission, Financials)

> "When you're interviewing at a company, you are actually investing an even more scarce resource. You're investing your time. There is no way to get more time. We're all on a finite clock. You can always get more money." - Adam Fishman

## What It Is

PMF for Candidates is a framework for evaluating job opportunities, inspired by "product-market fit" but applied to career decisions. The acronym stands for **People, Mission, and Financials**—three criteria that Adam Fishman uses to decide whether a company is the right fit.

The framework puts power back in the hands of job seekers. Just as investors do due diligence before investing money, candidates should do due diligence before investing their time—an even more scarce resource.

Adam has tested this framework across his career: Lyft and Patreon (where he applied it well) were successes. Wyzant and Imperfect Foods (where he shortcut it) didn't end well.

## How It Works

### P - People

Are these folks you'll enjoy working with every day?

Evaluate:
- Can you have hard conversations and disagree productively?
- Will disagreements lead to resolutions or lingering conflict?
- What about your peer set, leaders, and direct reports?
- How does the leadership team work together?

**Red flags**: Infighting at the C-suite, unresolved disagreements, antagonistic feedback delivery

### M - Mission

If you do your job (growing the company big), will the world be better?

Evaluate:
- Does the company's success create value beyond financial returns for founders and employees?
- Will customers/users have better outcomes because this company exists?
- Does the mission motivate you personally?

**Example**: At Patreon, growing the company meant creators could make sustainable livings, hire people, and create better content—not just a financial outcome for investors.

### F - Financials (Fiscal Discipline)

Is the company financially responsible?

Evaluate:
- Did they raise responsibly or overspend during peak times?
- Are they conservative with runway or assuming infinite growth?
- Is there a strong CFO and financial planning function?
- Are they likely to need layoffs in the near future?

**Key insight**: Companies that were conservative during the pandemic aren't laying people off now—but you don't hear about them because there's no "hashtag layoff" for them.

## How to Apply It

### 1. Define Your Non-Negotiables

You should have criteria you're "unapologetically rigorous" about. PMF is Adam's—yours might be different, but have explicit criteria.

### 2. Evaluate People Through Observation

- **Attend meetings**: Ask to observe a team meeting, product review, or executive meeting (sign an NDA if needed)
- **Watch dynamics**: Who does the talking? How is feedback delivered? Is it constructive or antagonistic?
- **Ask behavioral questions in reverse**:
  > "Tell me about the last strategic offsite. Where did people disagree? What did they disagree on? How did you get to resolution?"

### 3. Do Back-Channel References

Just like companies back-channel candidates, you should back-channel companies:

- Talk to **current employees not on the interview circuit** (their salesperson role is diminished)
- Talk to **former employees** (they can be more candid)
- Ask your manager candidates: "Can I talk to people you've managed before?"

**Example**: Tal Raviv, when interviewing at Patreon, asked Adam for a list of people he'd managed and contacted them. If a manager says no to this, that says a lot about them.

### 4. Evaluate Financials

- Ask about runway, burn rate, and path to profitability
- Research recent funding and layoff history
- Look for signs of conservative financial planning

### 5. Don't Settle for 2 out of 3

Every time Adam shortcut his criteria or settled for "close enough," it didn't end well:
- **Wyzant**: Great mission, but people mismatch (founders expected a "silver bullet")
- **Imperfect Foods**: Amazing mission, great financials, but C-suite infighting made execution impossible

## When to Use It

- **Evaluating job offers** - Run every opportunity through all three criteria
- **Interviewing** - Structure your questions around understanding P, M, and F
- **Deciding to leave** - If one dimension has degraded significantly, consider whether it's time to move on
- **During layoffs** - Take your time; evaluate new opportunities rigorously despite pressure

## Questions to Ask

### For People
- "Tell me about the last strategic offsite. Where did people disagree and how did you resolve it?"
- "Can I observe a team meeting or product review?"
- "Can I speak with people you've managed in the past?"

### For Mission
- "How does the company measure success beyond financial metrics?"
- "What impact has the company had on customers' lives?"

### For Financials
- "What's your current runway?"
- "How has financial planning changed since 2021?"
- "What's your path to profitability?"

## The Investment Mindset

Think like an investor:
- Investors do extensive diligence before deploying capital
- But time is more scarce than money—you can always make more money
- Your career is an investment of your most finite resource
- Do at least as much diligence as you would for a financial investment
