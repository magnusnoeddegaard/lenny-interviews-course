# Feather Brick Dump Truck

> "When we are showing early signs of burnout, our body will give us feedback usually in subtle ways in the beginning." - Jonny Miller

## What It Is

The Feather Brick Dump Truck phenomenon describes the escalating severity of burnout warning signs that our bodies give us. The key insight is that burnout doesn't appear suddenly—it sends increasingly urgent signals that most people ignore until crisis strikes.

The more attuned you are to your body's signals (interoception), the earlier you can catch these warnings and make adjustments. Unfortunately, many high-performers only notice the "dump truck" because they've trained themselves to push through discomfort.

## How It Works

**The Feather (Early Warning)**
- Waking up feeling tired or exhausted
- Subtle decrease in motivation
- Minor sleep disturbances
- Slight irritability

**The Brick (Escalating Signs)**
- Having fights or arguments with people
- Losing your cool more frequently
- Feeling frustrated and terrible
- Disproportionate reactions to small problems
- Difficulty downshifting without substances (wine, CBD, etc.)

**The Dump Truck (Crisis)**
- Full-blown health crisis
- Serious illness (type 2 diabetes, heart issues)
- Getting fired
- Complete breakdown or inability to function
- Major relationship failures

## How to Apply It

1. **Develop interoceptive awareness** - Practice noticing subtle body signals through APE (Awareness, Posture, Emotion) check-ins
2. **Track the feathers** - Keep a simple log of energy levels, sleep quality, and mood
3. **Act on early signals** - When you notice feathers, make adjustments immediately rather than pushing through
4. **Create recovery rituals** - Build in regular downshifting practices to prevent debt accumulation
5. **Know your patterns** - Learn your personal warning signs from past experiences

## When to Use It

- During high-intensity work periods to monitor sustainability
- After noticing you're more reactive than normal
- When sleep quality starts declining
- If you find yourself needing substances to relax
- When relationships start feeling strained
- During annual or quarterly self-reviews
