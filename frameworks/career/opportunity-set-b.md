# Opportunity Set B

> "In front of you right now, there are two sets of opportunities. Opportunity Set A is everything that's asked of you... Then there's Opportunity Set B, and Opportunity Set B is what's available to you, even though nobody's asking you to do it." - Jason Feifer

## What It Is

A framework for thinking about career growth by distinguishing between two types of opportunities:

**Opportunity Set A**: Everything that's asked of you. If you have a job, it's what your boss expects. If you run a company, it's what stakeholders expect. Doing well at these things is important—it's the baseline measurement of success.

**Opportunity Set B**: What's available to you, even though nobody is asking you to do it. This could be taking on new responsibilities, joining a new team, starting a side project, pursuing a hobby, or building new skills.

The key insight: If you only focus on Opportunity Set A, you are only qualified to do the things you're already doing. Opportunity Set B is where growth happens.

## How It Works

Jason Feifer illustrates this with his own career at Entrepreneur Magazine:

- **Set A**: His job was to make a good magazine and direct the editorial brand
- **Set B**: Speaking, podcasts, writing a book, building a personal brand

Nobody at Entrepreneur told him to hit the speaking circuit, get good at podcasts, or write a book. But these opportunities were available to him because of his position—and pursuing them transformed his identity from "magazine editor" to "entrepreneur who helps entrepreneurs."

The framework helps you recognize that:
1. **Set A keeps you in place** - Essential for job security but doesn't drive growth
2. **Set B drives transformation** - Creates new opportunities and redefines who you are
3. **Nobody will ask you** - You have to identify and pursue Set B yourself

## How to Apply It

1. **Map your current Set A** - List everything that's explicitly expected of you in your role

2. **Identify your Set B** - Ask: "What opportunities are available to me right now that nobody is asking me to pursue?" Consider:
   - Skills you could develop
   - Projects you could start
   - Relationships you could build
   - Content you could create
   - Responsibilities you could volunteer for

3. **Evaluate the leverage** - Which Set B opportunities could lead to the next phase of your career?

4. **Allocate time deliberately** - Don't let Set A consume all your energy. Protect time for Set B work

5. **Connect them** - The best Set B activities often enhance your Set A performance, creating a virtuous cycle

## When to Use It

- **Career planning** - When feeling stuck or wanting to accelerate growth
- **Annual reviews** - Assess what Set B activities you pursued and their impact
- **Role transitions** - When starting a new job, immediately scan for Set B opportunities
- **Side projects** - Evaluate whether projects are genuine Set B opportunities or distractions
- **Building a personal brand** - Identify how to leverage your position for broader visibility
