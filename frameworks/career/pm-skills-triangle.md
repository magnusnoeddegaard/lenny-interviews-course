# PM Skills Triangle

> "I've actually never seen a great PM who's in the center of it. I find the great PMs live on the edges. There's always someone who's this exceptional data scientist and the ability to maybe be a great GM and lead and inspire, or maybe someone who's so creative, who can lead a team in a different way." - Hari Srinivasan

## What It Is

The PM Skills Triangle maps three fundamental skill areas that product managers need:

1. **Creator** (Steven Spielberg-type) - Design intuition, creativity, ability to envision new products
2. **Data Scientist** - Analytical rigor, pattern recognition, ability to see the future in data
3. **General Manager** - Leadership, team inspiration, business acumen, cross-functional coordination

The counterintuitive insight: great PMs don't sit in the center trying to be equally good at everything. They excel by **living on the edges**—having exceptional strength in 1-2 areas while being competent in the third.

## How It Works

Picture a triangle with each skill at a vertex:

```
         Creator
            △
           / \
          /   \
         /     \
        /       \
       /_________\
 Data Scientist   GM
```

**Mediocre PMs** try to position themselves in the center—decent at everything, exceptional at nothing.

**Great PMs** position themselves on an edge or near a corner:
- **Creator + GM edge**: Visionary product leaders who can inspire teams and ship creative products
- **Data + GM edge**: Analytical leaders who can drive growth and scale organizations
- **Creator + Data edge**: Product scientists who can validate and iterate on innovative ideas

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your natural position** - Where do you already excel? What energizes you?
2. **Double down on strengths** - Don't try to become average at everything
3. **Pick complementary roles** - Seek positions that leverage your edge
4. **Build T-shaped teams** - Surround yourself with people strong where you're weak
5. **Evolve over time** - Your position may shift as you grow; GM skills often become more important at senior levels

For **hiring managers**:
- Don't seek the mythical "all-around PM"
- Match candidates' triangle position to role requirements
- Build diverse teams with complementary strengths

## When to Use It

- Career planning: Deciding where to invest in skill development
- Job searching: Finding roles that match your strengths
- Hiring: Evaluating candidates and building balanced teams
- Self-assessment: Understanding what kind of PM you are
- Team composition: Ensuring diverse skill coverage
