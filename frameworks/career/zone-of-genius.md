# Zone of Genius

> "Really believing in leaning into strengths... What do I do that no one else in this organization can do? There are lots of things that I do that other people can do, but what are the things that are hard to replicate?" - Claire Vo

## What It Is

Zone of Genius is a career sustainability framework that helps you identify and maximize time spent in work where you're both exceptional and energized. The core insight is that sustainable high performance comes not from volume or breadth of responsibility, but from operating in your unique space of excellence.

The framework addresses a common trap: high performers often take on more and more scope because they're good at things, eventually ending up with too many responsibilities outside their zone of genius. This isn't fair to them or the organization.

Claire Vo uses this framework to evaluate both her own role and when promoting others. The question isn't "can they do the job?" but "are they operating in their zone of genius?"

## How It Works

**The Definition:**
Your zone of genius is the intersection of two things:
1. Work that is hard for others to replicate—where your unique skills shine
2. Work that gives you tremendous intellectual and emotional joy

**The Energy Audit Technique:**

1. Review your calendar for the last month or quarter
2. List everything you did
3. Categorize into four buckets:
   - "I hated doing this"
   - "I didn't love it but it was fine"
   - "I loved doing this"
   - "If I could spend all my time here, I'd be the happiest person in the world"
4. Ignore the bottom three buckets
5. Focus on the top bucket and ask: "How can I be here more?"

**The Differentiation Question:**
Ask yourself: "What do I do that no one else in this organization can do?" Like a differentiated product that's hard to replicate, knowing your unique value and leaning into it drives career growth and happiness.

## How to Apply It

1. **Run the energy audit** - Be honest about what drains you versus energizes you. The top bucket reveals your zone.

2. **Identify your unique contribution** - What skills combine in you that don't exist elsewhere in the org? This is your competitive advantage.

3. **Protect builder time** - Even with broad responsibility, preserve time for work that comes from you individually. Calendar management is essential.

4. **Evaluate promotions carefully** - Before promoting someone or accepting more scope yourself, ask: "Will this keep them/me in their zone of genius?"

5. **Resist scope creep outside your zone** - Being good at something doesn't mean you should do it. Being exceptional AND energized is the bar.

## When to Use It

- When evaluating whether to take on new responsibilities
- When feeling burned out or drained despite success
- When making promotion decisions for yourself or others
- When structuring your role at a new company
- When someone is high performing but unhappy
- During career planning conversations
