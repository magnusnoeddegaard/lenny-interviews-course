# Enthusiastic Gratitude for Feedback

> "If you manage to get them to take the risk to give you the feedback, your answer has to be enthusiastically grateful. That's the key. What people knew at Slack, Google, et cetera, is if you give me feedback, I'll be like, 'Hey, thank you so much. This is super helpful,' because people are like, 'Oh, he actually likes the feedback.' Now, inside, my heart might be melting. I'm like, 'Oh, I thought I got better at this.' But externally, I'm like, 'Hey, thank you,' and I mean it." - Jules Walter

## What It Is

Enthusiastic Gratitude for Feedback is a technique for consistently getting honest, useful feedback from colleagues by training them that giving you feedback is safe and welcomed. When someone takes the risk to give you constructive input, responding with genuine enthusiasm—regardless of how the feedback makes you feel internally—creates a reputation that unlocks more and better feedback over time.

The insight is that most people never get honest feedback because they've inadvertently signaled it's unwelcome. Defensive reactions, visible disappointment, or even lukewarm acknowledgment teaches people to withhold the truth. By consistently responding enthusiastically, you reverse this pattern.

Jules Walter became known at Slack and Google as someone who genuinely appreciated feedback, which led to colleagues sharing the candid, specific insights that accelerated his development—including the subjective EQ feedback that's hardest to get.

## How It Works

**The Problem: Feedback Scarcity**

Most professionals operate in a feedback desert:
- Colleagues worry about hurting feelings or damaging relationships
- Managers soften criticism to avoid conflict
- Interview feedback is never shared
- EQ issues are discussed in calibration rooms but not with you

The result: You can't improve what you don't know about.

**The Solution: Train People That Feedback Is Safe**

When you consistently respond to feedback with enthusiasm:
- People learn you won't react defensively
- They stop doing translation work to soften the message
- They share increasingly candid observations
- You get the raw, specific feedback that actually helps

**Internal vs External Response**

The technique acknowledges a gap between internal feelings and external response:

| What Happens Inside | What You Show Outside |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| "I thought I was better at this" | "Thank you so much" |
| Disappointment, frustration | Genuine appreciation |
| Defensive thoughts | Curiosity, follow-up questions |
| Heart melting | "This is super helpful" |

The key is that your external response must be genuinely warm—not performative. Over time, you actually do appreciate the feedback because you see its value.

## How to Apply It

### In the Moment

1. **Pause before responding** - Notice any defensive reaction arising
2. **Lead with thanks** - "Thank you so much for telling me that"
3. **Express genuine appreciation** - "This is really helpful"
4. **Ask clarifying questions** - Show you want to understand, not debate
5. **Avoid defending or explaining** - Just receive it

### Phrases That Work

- "Thank you, this is super helpful."
- "I really appreciate you telling me that directly."
- "That's valuable feedback—can you tell me more about when you noticed that?"
- "I hadn't realized that. Thanks for bringing it up."

### Phrases to Avoid

- "Well, the reason I did that was..."
- "I think there might be some context you're missing..."
- "That's interesting" (code for dismissal)
- "I'll think about that" (without enthusiasm)

### Creating Feedback Opportunities

Beyond responding well, actively seek feedback:

1. **Be specific in your ask** - "I'm working on executive presence—did you see that in my presentation?"

2. **Offer your own critique first** - "I felt my Q&A answers were weak. What did you think?" This gives them permission to agree or add.

3. **Ask about patterns** - "Is there something you notice I do regularly that I might not be aware of?"

4. **Follow up on previous feedback** - "You mentioned X last month. Have you noticed any change?"

### Building the Reputation

Over time, your reputation becomes self-reinforcing:
- People share feedback more readily
- They skip the translation/softening
- You get the specific, actionable insights
- Which accelerates your development
- Making the feedback even more valuable

## Getting the Hard Feedback

The most valuable feedback is the subjective EQ stuff—how you make people feel, how you come across, your blind spots. This requires deeper trust:

**Build relationships where people can be direct:**
- "You don't have to translate with me. Just tell me what you observed."
- Be vulnerable first to model safety
- Show that you act on feedback (circle back with what you changed)

**Jules's examples of high-value feedback he received:**
- "When you're thinking, you're just quiet. In my head I'm telling myself you're not interested."
- "Sometimes when you ask questions, you sound more junior."
- "When I talk to you, sometimes I feel like you're angry."

This kind of feedback only comes from people who trust that you'll receive it well.

## When to Use It

- After any performance review or 360 feedback
- Following presentations or important meetings
- In 1:1s with managers and skip-levels
- With trusted mentors
- After collaborative projects
- In interview debriefs (rare but valuable)

## Why This Is Hard

- Ego protection is natural—we want to feel competent
- Negative feedback triggers defensive responses
- It requires sustained effort over time
- You have to mean it—people detect performative responses

The investment pays off because honest feedback is rare and valuable. Most people optimize to protect your feelings. When you create safety, you get truth instead.
