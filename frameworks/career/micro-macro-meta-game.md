# Micro-Macro-Meta Game

> "You need to understand what game you're playing and you need to get good at the micro. It's not that the meta is more important than the micro, it's like you need to do all three at the same time." - Drew Houston

## What It Is

Borrowed from competitive gaming (specifically StarCraft), this framework describes three distinct levels of skill that founders must develop simultaneously. Most founders fixate on one level while neglecting others, leading to blindspots that compound into existential problems.

Drew Houston uses this gaming metaphor because the parallels to running a company are striking: limited attention (like APM in games), the need for both execution and strategy, and an ever-shifting competitive landscape that changes the rules while you play.

## How It Works

**The Micro Game**
In gaming: How fast can you click? How many actions per minute? The mechanical execution.

In startups: Product design, engineering details, distribution mechanics, sales motions, viral loops. The tangible craft of building and shipping. Early founders are typically absorbed here because there's no one else to do it.

**The Macro Game**
In gaming: Economy management, military balance, scouting, strategic positioning. More conceptual than micro.

In startups: Business model, market selection, competitive positioning, defensibility, organizational structure. How to evolve from one product to multiple products, when to reorganize, how the category will mature.

**The Meta Game**
In gaming: How the game itself changes over time - both through developer updates and emergent player strategies. Playing StarCraft in 2020 is different from 2010.

In startups: Business cycles (boom/bust), fundamental shifts in how business works (like the shift from traditional press to social/podcasts for launching products), platform shifts, new distribution paradigms. What was true about startups in 2007 may not be true in 2025.

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your current focus** - Which level are you spending most of your time on? Early founders often over-index on micro; later-stage founders may drift too far into macro while losing touch with product details.

2. **Identify your weaknesses by level**:
   - Micro: Can't ship? Quality issues? Distribution not working?
   - Macro: No clear business model? Wrong market? Bad competitive position?
   - Meta: Playing by yesterday's rules? Missing fundamental shifts?

3. **Learn from different sources for each level**:
   - Micro: Tactical books, peers at same stage
   - Macro: Strategy books (Playing to Win, Good Strategy Bad Strategy), founders 2-5 years ahead
   - Meta: History, economic cycles, founders 10-20 years ahead who've seen multiple cycles

4. **Recognize meta shifts before they're obvious** - Drew notes that presidential candidates are on podcasts now, not just CNN. Dropbox got almost no traditional press coverage for Dash but huge social engagement. These meta shifts matter.

5. **Don't assume any level is "more important"** - You need all three simultaneously. Missing any one can kill you.

## When to Use It

- When you feel like you're working hard but not making strategic progress
- When you're succeeding at execution but losing to competitors anyway
- When strategies that used to work mysteriously stop working
- When planning your personal learning agenda as a founder
- When evaluating why a company failed or succeeded
