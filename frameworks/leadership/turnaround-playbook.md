# Turnaround Playbook

> "Part of that is the turnaround playbook. Okay, first, it's just getting out of this delusional state where you think you're great, just splashing cold water on everyone, and be like, 'Look, we haven't shipped anything. Last three years, the only thing our customers have really meaningfully seen from our product is a price increase. What the hell are we doing?'" - Drew Houston

## What It Is

The Turnaround Playbook is Drew Houston's framework for pulling a successful-but-stagnant company out of decline. It addresses both the cultural rot that accumulates in successful companies and the practical steps needed to rebuild momentum.

The key insight is that success plants the seeds of failure. Companies that rise to the top do so through challenger mentality, eating what they kill, grinding against the odds. But once successful, there's a temptation to take your foot off the gas, enjoy success, and focus on things other than what got you there. This creates complacency, entitlement, and eventually stagnation.

Drew earned what he calls the "stagnation and irrelevance merit badge" at Dropbox before earning the "turnaround merit badge."

## How It Works

**Phase 1: Break Delusion**
- Confront reality directly: "What have we actually shipped for customers?"
- Splash cold water on comfortable narratives
- Acknowledge that external factors aren't the whole problem
- Accept that many wounds are self-inflicted

**Phase 2: Cultural Reset**
- Refocus on craft and quality
- Embrace growth mindset and learning
- Stop blaming external factors
- Build high-agency culture
- Stop displacing blame to others

**Phase 3: Team Reboot**
- Address the seniority gap
- May require rebuilding the exec team
- Balance experienced leaders with high-potential talent
- Stop battlefield promotions that created the problem

**Phase 4: Strategic Focus**
- Identify where you can actually win
- Stop fighting on too many fronts
- Get the P&L healthy (Dropbox turned cash flow positive)
- Have a clear vision people can rally around

**Phase 5: Embody the Change**
- The founder must personally embody the new culture
- Can't just mandate change; must live it
- Reconnect with product and customers
- Stop apologizing for the company you want to build

## How to Apply It

1. **Diagnose honestly** - What have you actually delivered to customers recently? If the answer is "mostly price increases," you have a problem.

2. **Acknowledge the pattern** - This isn't unusual. Many SaaS productivity companies have a "sophomore slump." You're not special for failing, and you're not special for needing to fix it.

3. **Address culture before strategy** - Strategic focus won't work if the culture rewards complacency and blame displacement.

4. **Reboot the team if necessary** - Drew had to "reboot the whole exec team." The people who rode success may not be the people who can rebuild.

5. **Get financially healthy** - Having cash flow breathing room gives you space to transform. Dropbox went cash flow positive in 2016.

6. **Create a compelling new vision** - People need something to rally around. Dropbox's became "designing a more enlightened way of working."

7. **Sustain yourself through it** - Turnarounds are exhausting. Build the personal support ecosystem you need.

## When to Use It

- When your company shipped great products years ago but has stagnated
- When employees don't want to wear company t-shirts anymore
- When the press narrative has turned permanently negative
- When you're fighting on too many fronts against bigger competitors
- When cultural problems (complacency, entitlement, blame) have set in
