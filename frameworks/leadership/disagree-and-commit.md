# Disagree and Commit

> "The point of that disagreement is to provide usually additional information or a new point of view that people have not considered... What would often happen is someone would come to me with a disagreement and many times I'd appreciate it, because they'd bring some point of view that was useful." - Bill Carr

## What It Is

Disagree and Commit is Amazon's framework for decision-making that accomplishes two things: it obligates people to voice dissenting views before a decision is made, and then requires genuine commitment once the decision is final—not reluctant compliance.

Bill Carr notes this was "the least well understood" of Amazon's leadership principles, "partly because it is actually the most nuanced and difficult to actually use."

The framework borrows from Peter Drucker's thinking on decision-making: great decisions require understanding all different points of view first. Like a king and their court, the purpose of disagreement is to surface information and perspectives that would otherwise be missed.

## How It Works

**The Disagree Part:**
- You are **obligated** to voice your point of view if you disagree
- The purpose is to bring new information, data, or perspective
- You may escalate "all the way up the chain if necessary" for important issues
- The goal is to help the decision-maker make a better decision

**The Commit Part:**
- Once your disagreement has been heard and considered, you commit
- The trigger: The leader shows they understand your point of view and have taken it into consideration
- True commitment means understanding why the decision was made, not just going along with it
- You should be able to reflect the reasoning back to your own team

**When to Stop Disagreeing:**
Bill Carr is specific about this moment: "As long as the disagreer is hearing back from the leader that they understand their point of view, understand why they are pushing back and seem to fully understand it, and they've taken that into consideration, that is the point for them to commit."

## How to Apply It

**Step 1: Understand your obligation to disagree**
If you have relevant information, data, or a perspective that hasn't been considered, you must share it. Silence is not neutral—it's a failure of your responsibility.

**Step 2: Make your case with substance**
Disagreement should provide:
- New information or data
- A different point of view
- Evidence of potential problems
- Alternative approaches

Not just: "I don't like this" or "I disagree."

**Step 3: Listen for understanding**
The decision-maker should demonstrate they understand your point. If they say "We've already considered that factor, and here are other factors that outweigh it"—you've been heard.

**Step 4: Commit genuinely, not grudgingly**
Bad commitment: "I don't really agree, but I'll go along with it."

Good commitment: You understand the core reasoning. You can explain to your team why the decision was made. You're genuinely trying to make it succeed.

**Step 5: When you still don't agree, find the kernel**
Bill Carr shares advice from Steve Kessel for working with Jeff Bezos:
- "Look for what that is" - find the core of why the leader thinks this direction is right
- "Take that kernel and try to run with it"
- "Try to see how I can take that idea, that concept, and then make it into something viable"

This isn't just going through the motions—it's genuinely engaging with the decision.

## When to Use It

- Any significant decision where multiple perspectives exist
- When you have information the decision-maker might not have
- When you're uncertain about a direction but have concerns
- Team decisions that require unified execution

## Common Mistakes

**1. Not knowing when to stop disagreeing**
Many people continue pushing past the point of usefulness. Once you've been heard and your input considered, it's time to commit.

**2. Fake commitment**
Saying "I'm committed" while telling your team "I don't think this is right but we have to do it anyway." This undermines the decision and your credibility.

**3. Missing the "have backbone" part**
The full principle is "Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit." Some people skip straight to compliance without ever voicing their concerns.

**4. Using disagreement as veto**
Disagreement is input, not a veto. The decision-maker still makes the call.

**5. Not understanding the reasoning**
If you can't explain why the decision was made, you haven't truly committed. Go back and understand the logic.

## The "Thinking Vector" Approach

When you genuinely still don't agree, Bill Carr recommends focusing on:
- What is the core of what this person is thinking?
- What's the big benefit or thinking vector causing them to want this direction?
- Even if you don't agree, can you understand and work with that kernel?

This isn't blind obedience—it's intellectual engagement with the decision.
