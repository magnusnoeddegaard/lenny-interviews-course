# Trust Extension Technique

> "If I wanted to accelerate trust with Lenny, I will ask Lenny to teach me... The most powerful way I have found to get trust with many people is to have them accountable for an outcome of mine, which is to know." - Christian Idiodi

## What It Is

The Trust Extension Technique is a method for rapidly building trust and relationships in a new environment by asking influential people to teach you. Rather than waiting to prove yourself through work (which requires opportunities that may not come), you extend someone else's trust to yourself by making them accountable for your learning.

Christian Idiodi considers this an "emotional intelligence black belt technique" for accelerating relationships in any new environment.

## How It Works

### The Psychology

1. **Trust requires testing** - People don't know you know something until they test you
2. **Failed tests destroy trust** - Public questions you can't answer erode credibility
3. **Teaching creates accountability** - When someone teaches you, they become invested in your success
4. **Association transfers trust** - Being seen with trusted people transfers some of their credibility to you

### The Mechanism

When you make an influential person accountable for teaching you:

1. **They can't let you fail publicly** - It would reflect poorly on their teaching
2. **They prep you for situations** - They warn you about traps and politics
3. **They introduce you to others** - You gain their network by association
4. **They defend you** - Two months later, they can't say you're incompetent without admitting they're a bad teacher

### The Technique in Practice

When onboarding someone new:

1. **Identify the power in the environment** - Who is influential? Who has the loudest voice? Who does everyone know?

2. **Request teaching, not mentoring** - "I would love for you to teach them some things"

3. **Make it low friction** - "They should just hang with you. Sit in your meetings. Observe. No stress."

4. **Let proximity do the work** - It's impossible to sit with someone all week without them asking about you, sharing context, making introductions

5. **The new person gains by association** - Others see them with the influential person and want to know them too

## How to Apply It

### For Managers (Onboarding New Hires)

1. Identify the loudest, most influential person in the relevant area
2. Bring your new hire to them and say: "I just hired [name]. Super rockstar. But they know nothing about our business. I'd love for you to teach them."
3. If they say they're busy: "They should just sit in meetings with you. By observing you, they'll be a rockstar. No stress."
4. Clear your new hire's calendar for a week of shadowing
5. Watch relationships form naturally

### For Individuals (New to an Environment)

1. Identify who holds influence and trust in your new company
2. Ask them directly: "I want to learn. Can you teach me?"
3. Offer to help them: "I'll intern for you. Let me help with anything."
4. Make yourself useful while learning their knowledge and network
5. You're extending their trust to yourself

### The Two Approaches

Ask the influential person to do one of two things:
1. **"You're going to teach me"** - Direct request for their knowledge
2. **"I'm going to help you"** - Indirect learning while providing value

Both create relationship and transfer trust.

## When to Use It

- **Onboarding new employees** - Especially in companies with strong informal power structures
- **Joining a new company yourself** - Accelerate beyond the typical "prove yourself" period
- **Starting a new role internally** - Build credibility in unfamiliar territory
- **Coaching PMs on influence** - Help them build trust faster
- **Any situation where trust determines access** - Most corporate environments
