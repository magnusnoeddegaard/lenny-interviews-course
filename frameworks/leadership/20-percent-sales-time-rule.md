# 20% Sales Time Rule

> "If you're not spending 20% of your time in sales and 20% of your time in recruiting, you're failing as a founder." - Jason Lemkin

## What It Is

The 20% Sales Time Rule is a threshold indicator for when founders need to hire their first sales reps. When more than 20% of your calendar is consumed by customer conversations, demos, and follow-ups, you need leverage—otherwise your calendar will die and everything else will suffer.

This isn't about avoiding sales. Before this point, founders should be deeply involved in closing the first 10-15 customers themselves. The rule is about recognizing when you've hit capacity.

## How It Works

**The Founder's Split**
For a CEO, Jason Lemkin argues nothing matters more than:
- 20% sales
- 20% recruiting

The rest—product, operations, fundraising—matters, but these two activities drive whether you survive.

**The Threshold**
- Below 20%: Keep selling yourself. You're still learning.
- At 20%: Start thinking about hiring.
- Above 20%: You need reps or you'll break.

**Why 20%?**
A founder's time is the scarcest resource. If sales takes more than a fifth of it, other critical work suffers: product vision, team building, culture, fundraising, customer success. The goal isn't to escape sales—it's to create leverage so you can do sales at scale.

## How to Apply It

### Tracking Your Time

1. **Audit your calendar** - What percentage is customer-facing? Include prep time.
2. **Be honest** - Sales includes demos, follow-ups, proposals, references, onboarding calls
3. **Check weekly** - This can change fast as you get more inbound

### Preparing to Hire

4. **Aim for 10+ closed customers first** - You need to know what works
5. **Document your process** - What are you saying that works? What objections arise?
6. **Budget for two reps** - Not one (see Two Rep A/B Test)

### Maintaining Involvement

7. **Stay in the field** - Even with reps, stay involved in key deals
8. **Be the crummy first head of sales** - You manage those first reps yourself
9. **Graduate to VP** - Only after two reps are hitting quota consistently

## The Middler Advantage

Even founders who "don't like sales" are naturally good at one part: the middle. Founders can:
- Explain the product deeply
- Answer technical questions competitors can't
- Understand customer problems intimately
- Build trust as the person who built the solution

What founders often struggle with:
- Outbound (finding leads)
- Opening (cold contact)
- Closing (asking for the money)

This is why the threshold matters—you need reps to handle the beginning and end while you leverage your middle expertise on the biggest deals.

## Common Mistakes

- **Hiring too early** - Before you have 10 customers and know what works
- **Hiring too late** - Letting sales consume 40-50% of your time, neglecting everything else
- **Hiring VP too early** - VP of Sales should come after two reps are hitting quota
- **Completely delegating** - Even after hiring, stay in the field on important deals

## When to Break the Rule

Some situations require founders to exceed 20%:
- Pre-revenue when you're closing first customers
- Major strategic deals that need founder involvement
- Enterprise sales where founders are the differentiator
- Crisis moments in key accounts

The rule isn't about never exceeding 20%—it's about recognizing when you need systematic help.
