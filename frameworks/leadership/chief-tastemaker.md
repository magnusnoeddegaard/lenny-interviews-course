# Chief Tastemaker

> "It's actually now also hard to taste the soup without participating in at least some part of creating the soup. Meaning with AI, you can kind of look at the final product and say, 'Okay, this feels right or not.' But I think to really understand the solution space of what's possible, you have to be in the details." - Howie Liu

## What It Is

Chief Tastemaker is the concept that the CEO (particularly of a product company) must serve as the ultimate arbiter of product quality, experience, and direction. Like a chef who tastes every dish before it leaves the kitchen, the CEO must maintain direct engagement with the product to ensure quality and coherence.

In the AI era, this becomes even more critical—and harder. You can't evaluate AI products from screenshots or recordings. You have to interact with them, push their boundaries, and understand what the underlying capabilities can actually do. The tastemaking role requires getting your hands dirty.

## How It Works

**What It Requires:**

1. **Direct product engagement** - Actually using the product, not just reviewing dashboards
2. **Understanding capabilities** - Playing with underlying models and tools, not just packaged features
3. **Experiencing edge cases** - Testing non-golden-path scenarios to understand real behavior
4. **Maintaining vision coherence** - Ensuring all parts of the product feel like one thing

**Why It Matters in AI:**

- AI capabilities evolve rapidly; taste must evolve with them
- The "solution space" of what's possible changes constantly
- You can't delegate understanding of new primitives
- Product UX must adapt to new capabilities, not just wrap them

**The UX Gap Howie Observes:**

> "What's under executed today in the world of AI products is there's so many awesome capabilities of AI, and most of them are really under merchandised, and there's very poor, actually, visual or otherwise metaphors or affordances given to users to help represent or understand what those underlying capabilities are."

The Chief Tastemaker bridges this gap between raw AI capability and delightful user experience.

## How to Apply It

Actionable steps for serving as Chief Tastemaker:

1. **Use your product daily** - Be among the top users; track your own usage metrics
2. **Play with primitives** - Use the underlying models directly (APIs, chat interfaces) to understand their limits
3. **Test competitors** - Try every new AI product that launches to understand the frontier
4. **Review prototypes interactively** - Don't accept screenshots; demand working demos you can manipulate
5. **Push on edge cases** - Ask "what happens if I do X?" for non-obvious scenarios

## When to Use It

This role is essential when:

- Your company's value proposition depends on product quality
- You're in a rapidly evolving technology space
- Product decisions involve taste, not just metrics
- Teams need clear direction on subjective quality questions

It's less applicable when:
- The business is operationally driven, not product-driven
- Product decisions are highly quantifiable
- You lack the domain expertise to make quality judgments
