# Keeper Test

> "If this person on my team came to me and said, 'I'm leaving today. I have a different opportunity and I would like to take it,' would I do everything I could to keep them at Netflix? If not, then I should be having that tough conversation about, 'Should you really be here? Are you in the right role?'" - Elizabeth Stone

## What It Is

The Keeper Test is Netflix's mental model for evaluating whether someone should remain on the team. Instead of complex performance reviews or rating systems, it asks a simple question: if this person said they were leaving today, would you fight hard to keep them?

The test creates a clear binary. Either you'd do "everything you could" to retain them, or you might feel "a little bit relieved" if they left. There's no middle ground. This forces managers to confront performance issues they might otherwise avoid.

The Keeper Test isn't designed to make people anxious—it's designed to make performance conversations normal. When asking "Am I passing your keeper test?" becomes part of regular one-on-ones, it removes the mystery and stress of not knowing where you stand.

## How It Works

The test operates as a forcing function for honest assessment:

1. **The question**: "If this person told me they were leaving for another opportunity today, would I do everything in my power to keep them?"

2. **If yes**: They're a keeper. Continue investing in their growth and development.

3. **If no (or hesitant)**: You need to have a direct conversation. Either help them get to keeper status or help them transition out.

4. **The goal**: When the "you should leave" conversation happens, the person shouldn't be surprised. If you've been giving feedback along the way, it becomes a mutual observation rather than a shock.

## How to Apply It

1. **Schedule regular self-reflection** - Ask yourself the keeper test question about each direct report at least monthly, not just during review periods.

2. **Make it part of one-on-ones** - Normalize team members asking "Am I passing your keeper test?" Create space for this question to be asked without it feeling loaded.

3. **Connect it to feedback** - The test only works if you've been giving candid feedback. You can only arrive at a fair "should you leave" conversation if you've communicated expectations clearly.

4. **Act on the answer** - If you find yourself hoping someone would leave, don't wait. Begin the conversation about whether this is the right fit, either for the role or the company.

5. **Focus on improvement first** - The goal isn't to fire people. It's to ensure everyone is getting honest feedback so they can either improve or find a better fit elsewhere.

## When to Use It

- During regular performance reflections with your team
- When you notice you're avoiding direct feedback with someone
- In one-on-ones when discussing career development
- When you feel uncertain about whether to address a performance issue
- As a team-level diagnostic for overall talent quality
