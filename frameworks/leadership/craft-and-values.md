# Craft and Values

> "Craft is your skill set, your taste. Value is your personal value and how do you see the world. Craft is interesting word. It's like about apply your value to some technical know-how and to make more clever trade-offs to create something new and useful and just keep doing that." - Ivan Zhao

## What It Is

Craft and Values is Notion's internal company philosophy that recognizes two distinct energies in building products: the craft of skillful execution and the values that make your work authentic and meaningful.

**Craft** is your skill set and taste applied to technical know-how. Ivan compares it to woodworking—making a cabinet more beautiful, more useful, feeling nicer in your hand. It's the permutation and trade-off making that turns raw capability into polished product.

**Values** are your personal beliefs about what should exist in the world. They're the aesthetic, the philosophy, the "why" behind what you build. For Notion, values include creativity, beauty, and the belief that more people should be able to create software.

The insight is that these energies are different and both necessary. Building purely for business (craft without values) produces commodities. Building purely from values (without craft) produces art projects nobody uses. The magic happens when you balance both—creating something authentic to yourself that also resonates with others.

## How It Works

The framework operates as a diagnostic for motivation and product direction:

**Building for Business (Craft-heavy):**
- Optimizes for the market's scorecard
- Treats product like a sport—arena, competition, winning
- Seeks users and revenue
- Risk: Produces commodities without soul

**Building for Values (Values-heavy):**
- Optimizes for your own aesthetic and beliefs
- Creates something you want the world to have
- More durable energy source, more fulfilling
- Risk: No users if too disconnected from market

The healthiest approach recognizes both energies and balances them consciously. Some days Ivan wakes up in competitive, business-building mode. Other days in values-driven, craft-focused mode. Both are valid, but building for values tends to be "more lasting and more fulfilling."

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your values** - What do you believe should exist in the world that doesn't yet? What aesthetic or philosophy drives you? For Notion, it's creativity and beauty in software.

2. **Develop your craft** - What skills and taste allow you to execute on those values? Craft isn't just technical ability—it's the judgment to make clever trade-offs.

3. **Monitor the balance** - Too much business focus and you build commodities. Too much values focus and nobody uses what you make. Check which direction you're drifting.

4. **Use values for durability** - When motivation flags, return to values. They're a more durable energy source than external scorecard wins.

5. **Build authenticity-first** - The most fulfilling work creates something authentic to yourself that happens to also be useful for others. Start from authenticity, then find the market fit.

## When to Use It

- When feeling burned out or unmotivated despite business success
- When your product feels generic or commodity-like
- When making trade-off decisions about product direction
- When hiring—does this person have both craft and values alignment?
- When onboarding teams to understand what the company stands for
