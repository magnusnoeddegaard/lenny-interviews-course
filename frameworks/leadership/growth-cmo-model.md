# Growth CMO Model

> "If your CMO and your product leader aren't married at the hip, you're just missing out on tons of opportunity." - Adam Grenier

## What It Is

The Growth CMO Model describes a new archetype of marketing leadership suited for product-driven companies. Traditional CMOs often fail in tech startups and scaleups because they operate with campaign-based thinking, long planning cycles, and separation between marketing and product. The Growth CMO integrates marketing deeply with product development and operates with the velocity of a growth team.

This isn't about replacing traditional marketing skills—it's about adapting how those skills are deployed. A Growth CMO still understands brand, positioning, and storytelling, but approaches them with data, iteration, and experimentation mindsets.

## How It Works

### Why Traditional CMOs Often Fail in Tech

Traditional marketing was established in the 1920s-1950s around products that took years to develop. The marketing team owned the box, shelf placement, and pricing because product development was done by a separate "science group" trying new cereal flavors.

In product-driven companies, this model breaks down because:
- The product IS the company—not a separate department's output
- Changes happen in days, not years
- Customer feedback is continuous, not campaign-based
- Marketing surfaces are inside the product, not just external

### The Three Pillars of a Growth CMO

**1. Data-Driven Across Everything**

Not just "performance marketing" (which implies "not brand"), but data-driven approaches to:
- Brand measurement and iteration
- The consideration funnel
- Retention and lifecycle marketing
- Every marketing activity, even if measurement is indirect

**2. Iteration as Operating System**

- Product-style sprints applied to marketing work
- Everything is potentially iterable: landing pages, logos, brand messaging, sales narratives
- Vision and long-term planning still exist, but execution is agile
- Brand investments followed immediately by the next iteration, not treated as one-time campaigns

**3. Experimentation as Culture**

- Experimentation isn't just "try a new channel"
- It's systematic testing of the entire funnel and customer experience
- Both external elements (ads, content) and internal elements (onboarding, product marketing)

### What It Looks Like in Practice

| Traditional CMO | Growth CMO |
|----------------|------------|
| Brand as campaign | Brand as continuous iteration |
| Plan for 24 months | Vision for 24 months, iterate weekly |
| Marketing owns promotion | Marketing integrated with product |
| Experiment = new channel | Experiment = everything |
| Product handed to marketing | Marketing shapes product surfaces |

## How to Apply It

### For Marketing Leaders Wanting to Evolve

1. **Learn product development fundamentals**
   - Take a course on agile product development
   - Read "Hacking Marketing" (marketing team on Agile)
   - Understand sprint processes and experimentation frameworks

2. **Practice iteration on brand**
   - Don't treat brand investments as one-and-done
   - After every brand activity, immediately plan the next iteration
   - Measure brand the way you measure performance (even if less precisely)

3. **Get closer to product**
   - If you're not "married at the hip" with your product leader, fix that first
   - Understand the product roadmap as well as you understand your marketing roadmap

### For Founders Hiring Marketing Leaders

1. **Assess chaos tolerance**
   - At Series C and below, ask about comfort with unpredictability
   - Look for willingness to do work they haven't done in 15 years

2. **Find their T-shape**
   - Every marketer has a core specialty (their T's vertical)
   - Understand what they're deep on, and how they plan to cover gaps
   - Ask: "How do you plan to adapt your strength to our stage?"

3. **Test for Dunning-Kruger awareness**
   - Adam's goal: "Get to the valley of despair on every skill"
   - Good candidates know what they're bad at and hire for it
   - Bad candidates think they can do everything

4. **Watch for iteration mindset**
   - Ask about a brand campaign that didn't work—what did they do next?
   - Red flag: "We planned it, executed it, measured it, reported it"
   - Green flag: "We iterated three times in market based on early signals"

## When to Use It

- Hiring your first senior marketing leader
- Evaluating why marketing leadership isn't working
- Coaching a traditional marketer to adapt to product-led environment
- Structuring marketing and product collaboration
