# VP of Free

> "Who's your VP of Free? Do you know anybody that has a VP of Free?... If you have this massive free base, who's your VP of Free?" - Jason Lemkin

## What It Is

VP of Free is the provocative question Jason Lemkin asks companies with freemium or PLG models: who in your organization champions the users who don't pay? Not the VP of Growth (focused on conversions). Not the VP of Sales (focused on revenue). Not the VP of Product (focused on features). Someone needs to represent the free users—and almost no one does.

Without a VP of Free, free users get exploited for short-term gains, destroying long-term compounding.

## Why This Matters

**Free users are your:**
- Future customers (they just haven't converted yet)
- Word of mouth engine (they recommend even if they don't pay)
- Brand advocates (they defend you in communities)
- Product quality forcing function (free products must be excellent)

**What happens without a champion:**
- Trials get shortened to force conversions
- Free features get degraded or removed
- Dark patterns creep in
- The long tail gets abused
- Compounding stops

## How It Works

**The Structural Problem:**

Everyone in the company has revenue incentives:
- VP of Growth: increase conversion rate → monetize free users faster
- VP of Sales: close deals → push everyone to paid
- VP of Marketing: generate leads → qualify free users out
- VP of Product: ship features → often for paying customers

Nobody has "keep free users happy" as a goal.

**Why This Destroys Compounding:**

The best SaaS businesses compound over 20+ years. Matt Mullenweg at WordPress emphasized this: the power of compounding is what most founders underestimate.

Every time you:
- Cut trial length to force faster decisions
- Hide free tiers to push conversions
- Degrade free product quality
- Add friction to free experience

You damage the compounding engine.

## How to Apply It

### Create Explicit Ownership

1. **Designate the owner** - Usually founders + product leadership
2. **Define success metrics** - Free user satisfaction, not just conversion
3. **Protect free in roadmap** - Feature investment for free tier
4. **Track free separately** - Don't just measure conversion

### Resist Short-Term Pressure

5. **Question every trial shortening** - "Does this help the customer or us?"
6. **Push back on dark patterns** - Checkout tricks destroy trust
7. **Maintain free product quality** - Free should work great, not be crippled
8. **Defend the long tail** - Most free users won't convert, and that's okay

### The Lenny Example

Lenny's newsletter has 600,000 readers:
- Small percentage converts to paid
- The other 590,000 still matter
- They share, recommend, build awareness
- Over-monetizing them destroys the community

Who represents the 590,000? That's the VP of Free question.

## Compounding vs. Extraction

**Compounding approach:**
- Infinite or long trials (Slack, Canva, Zoom)
- Excellent free product
- Patient conversion timeline
- Building lifetime relationships

**Extraction approach:**
- 14-day trials that force decisions
- Degraded free experience
- Aggressive conversion tactics
- Short-term revenue gains

The irony: extraction feels like winning but kills long-term value.

## Why Free Products Are Better Products

> "Free products are better software. Products that cannot offer a free edition cut corners because they don't have to be good at onboarding."

When you must make free work, you:
- Can't rely on humans to bridge gaps
- Must invest in self-service onboarding
- Must make the product truly intuitive
- Build quality that benefits all users

## The Weaponization Warning

2023 saw many companies "weaponize" their free tiers and customer success teams:

- Aggressive price increases not earned by value
- Cutting free features to force upgrades
- CS teams focused on upsells over help
- Threats to turn off service for non-payment

> "I'm going to give every person I work with, every portfolio, everyone a one-year pass, but the past is in the past."

Time to get back to being customer-centric.
