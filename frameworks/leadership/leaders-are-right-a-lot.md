# Leaders Are Right a Lot

> "Product leaders have to be right most of the time because their decisions reflect across the entire org and their decisions fundamentally spend time and they spend energy. And if they make good ones, the company does really well. And if they make bad ones, the company doesn't." - Jeremy Henrickson

## What It Is

Leaders Are Right a Lot is a leadership principle (also used at Amazon) that recognizes the outsized impact of judgment quality in product leadership roles. Great product leaders consistently make correct calls when navigating ambiguous situations with incomplete information and complex decision spaces.

This isn't about being smart or having the right credentials. It's about a specific skill: the ability to synthesize diverse inputs, read the situation, and arrive at the right answer—even when everyone else is uncertain. Some people have this skill strongly developed; others don't. And it's one of the hardest things to test for in hiring.

The principle acknowledges an uncomfortable truth: there's a core competence that can't really be learned. You either have strong judgment or you don't. Experience helps calibrate it, but the underlying pattern-matching ability is fundamental.

## How It Works

The principle manifests in several ways:

1. **Decision Quality Over Process**: What matters is whether the decision turns out to be right, not whether the process looked rigorous

2. **Confidence with Incomplete Information**: The ability to make a call and commit even when others are saying "I don't know"

3. **Retrospective Validation**: When you look back a year later, were the calls right? This is the ultimate test

4. **Compounding Effects**: Good decisions compound. A leader who's right 80% of the time will massively outperform one who's right 60% of the time over many decisions

**What it looks like in practice**: A product leader enters an ambiguous situation with incomplete information. They listen to everyone, read what they need to read, and then say "this is where we need to go." Even if others are skeptical, they have the confidence to make that call. A year later, looking back, they were right.

## How to Apply It

### For Hiring

1. **Ask for retrospective validation** - In references, ask "Was this person usually right in retrospect?"

2. **Test adaptability in case studies** - Present complex scenarios and then change assumptions mid-discussion. See how people adjust their thinking.

3. **Look for pattern-matching ability** - Can they quickly see the implications of new information across multiple dimensions?

4. **Watch for intellectual humility combined with decisiveness** - The best leaders change their minds when presented with new information, but still make calls decisively

### For Self-Development

1. **Track your decisions** - Keep a decision journal. What did you decide? What was your reasoning? How did it turn out?

2. **Do post-mortems on both successes and failures** - Understand why you were right or wrong, not just that you were

3. **Seek environments that allow being wrong** - You need to be able to say "I was wrong" to learn and recalibrate

4. **Go deep** - Being right a lot requires actually understanding the domain, not just having opinions

## When to Use It

- As a hiring criterion for product leadership roles
- As a self-evaluation metric for your own judgment quality
- As a cultural value that prioritizes outcome quality over process adherence
