# Notes on Road Trips (Values Discovery)

> "I hate corporate values. I've never resonated with them... What I realized was, there are some traits that define our team, extremely organically and naturally. No one told people what our values were... And what I realized was, all of the statements people would say about what they loved about The Browser Company, what they thought defined the way we work, they reminded me of how I like to take road trips." - Josh Miller

## What It Is

Notes on Road Trips is The Browser Company's approach to discovering and expressing company values. Rather than top-down definition of values by founders or executives, values are discovered through systematic interviews with the team to find patterns in what people already love about the culture. The values are then expressed not as corporate bullet points but through authentic storytelling.

The process rejects the standard "values statement" format in favor of something more human: at The Browser Company, their values are expressed as an essay about taking a road trip, using that metaphor to convey how the team approaches work.

The insight is that values already exist in how a team works—the job is to observe and articulate them, not invent them.

## How It Works

The process has several phases:

**Phase 1: Observation (Before Codification)**
- Let culture develop organically for 1-2 years
- Resist pressure to define values too early
- Notice what patterns emerge naturally

**Phase 2: Discovery (Through Interviews)**
- Interview every team member one-on-one
- Ask: "What do you love about working here? What defines how we work?"
- Look for repeated themes and phrases
- Use the actual words people use, not your interpretation

**Phase 3: Synthesis (Finding the Metaphor)**
- Look for a unifying concept that connects the themes
- For TBC, it was "road trips"—the adventurous, discovery-oriented approach
- The metaphor should feel authentic to the founders/team

**Phase 4: Expression (Storytelling Over Statements)**
- Write values as narrative, not bullet points
- Use story to make values memorable and emotional
- Let the story carry the values rather than stating them directly

## How to Apply It

1. **Wait before defining values**: Don't rush to create a values statement. Let your team work together long enough for real patterns to emerge.

2. **Interview comprehensively**: Talk to everyone, not just leaders. Ask open-ended questions about what they love.

3. **Use their words**: When someone says "we show up with heartfelt intensity," that phrase becomes the value—not your corporate translation of it.

4. **Find a metaphor that resonates**: Road trips worked for TBC. What metaphor captures your team's spirit?

5. **Invest in the artifact**: The essay/story form takes longer than bullet points. It's worth the extra time.

6. **Credit the team**: Make clear that values came from observation, not founder decree.

## When to Use It

- When traditional values statements feel hollow or inauthentic
- When you've been working together long enough that culture has actually emerged
- When you want values to be owned by the team, not imposed by leadership
- When storytelling and narrative are important to your culture
- When you have the time to invest in a meaningful discovery process

## The Browser Company's Values

Discovered through this process and expressed as a "road trip manual":

- **Heartfelt Intensity**: Show up with fire in your belly
- **Assume You Don't Know**: Beginner's mind, then take action
- **Start by Asking What Could Be**: Aspirational before practical
- **Do It for the Crew (Swarm)**: Help each other when needed
- **Make Them Feel Something**: Optimize for feelings, not just metrics
