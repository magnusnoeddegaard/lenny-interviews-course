# Everything is Temporary

> "The best advice I got when we were having our first kid... 'For better and for worse, everything's temporary. So the highs, you can't get too high. The lows, you can't get too low.'" - Keith Yandell

## What It Is

A mental model for maintaining emotional stability through business volatility. Both triumphs and disasters are temporary states—neither defines your trajectory. Leaders who internalize this can make better decisions because they're not riding emotional extremes.

Keith received this advice when expecting his first child, but found it most applicable during DoorDash's pandemic rollercoaster and other business crises.

## How It Works

### The DoorDash Pandemic Rollercoaster

Keith describes the pandemic as a compressed version of this principle:

1. **High**: Getting ready for IPO, exciting times
2. **Low**: Volume drops to near zero on day 1-2 of lockdown. "This is going out of business."
3. **High**: Volume suddenly doubles as people adapt
4. **Low**: Customer support centers worldwide shut down. Doubling volume with no support.
5. **Low**: App crashes every Friday night due to infrastructure limits
6. **High**: NPS goes up because customers are grateful for the service

All of this happened in a compressed timeframe. Getting too attached to any single state would have been paralyzing.

### Why It Matters

**Better decisions during lows**: Despair is a bad decision-making state. Knowing the low is temporary lets you focus on the path out rather than catastrophizing.

**Better decisions during highs**: Euphoria is equally dangerous. Overconfidence during good times leads to complacency, overspending, and missed warning signs.

**Sustainable leadership**: Riding every up and down is exhausting. Equanimity preserves energy for when it matters.

### The Tough Times Make Companies Corollary

Keith passes on advice from DoorDash board members: "Tough times make companies." Benefits include:

1. **Reveals mercenaries vs. missionaries** - Who leaves when things get hard?
2. **Forces discipline** - Constraints drive focus on unit economics
3. **Talent becomes available** - Great people are looking for opportunities during downturns

## How to Apply It

1. **Name the state explicitly** - "This is a high. It will pass." "This is a low. It will pass."

2. **Document your pattern** - Look back at past crises that felt terminal. They weren't.

3. **Separate the emotion from the decision** - "I feel panicked, but what does the situation actually require?"

4. **Don't over-celebrate or over-mourn** - Brief acknowledgment, then back to work. (DoorDash had their weekly business review immediately after the IPO bell.)

5. **Use the lows productively** - Tough times surface problems, clarify priorities, and strengthen whoever stays.

### Practical Applications

**After a big win**: "Somewhere, someone out there is practicing, and when you meet them, they will beat you." Stay hungry.

**After a big setback**: "It only takes one yes." The funding round that saves you might be one meeting away.

**During crisis**: "You have to try to find opportunities to reach the potential for the business. Decisions sometimes have to be made in very short time horizons."

## When to Use It

- **Startup rollercoasters** - The natural volatility of building something new
- **Fundraising** - Rejections feel permanent; they're not
- **Market downturns** - Every recession has ended
- **Personal setbacks** - Bad reviews, project failures, team departures
- **After major successes** - To prevent complacency

## Related Wisdom

Keith connects this to the pandemic experience: "People actually like crises at DoorDash... there's singularity of focus. You know what the job is."

Crises, like all things, are temporary. But they offer clarity that good times often don't.
