# Kind and Candid

> "Be kind and candid... We had to put them together because we, as founders, realized that we often would be nice and it wasn't actually the right thing to do. We would delay the difficult conversations and we were not candid." - Alexander Embiricos

## What It Is

Kind and Candid is a leadership principle that reframes radical candor not as something that exists in tension with kindness, but as an expression of kindness itself. The insight is that delaying difficult conversations or avoiding honest feedback is actually unkind to the person who could benefit from hearing the truth earlier.

Alexander Embiricos developed this as the number one company value at his startup before joining OpenAI. The key innovation is in how the two words are conjoined: being candid IS being kind, not something you do despite wanting to be kind.

The framework addresses a common leadership failure pattern: leaders who pride themselves on being "nice" often avoid necessary difficult conversations, hurting both individuals and the organization in the long run.

## How It Works

The framework creates a self-reinforcing loop:

1. **Recognition**: Notice when you're avoiding a difficult conversation out of "niceness"

2. **Reframe**: Ask yourself: "Is delaying this conversation actually kind, or is it just easier for me right now?"

3. **Calibration**: Continuously evaluate whether you were actually candid enough. Embiricos notes that every six months, they would realize they hadn't been candid enough in the previous period.

4. **Integration**: Think of candor as how you express kindness, not as a separate competing value. The question becomes: "How can I deliver this feedback in a way that is both candid AND kind?"

## How to Apply It

1. **Put them together explicitly** - Don't treat kindness and candor as separate values to balance. Combine them into one phrase, one value.

2. **Build in reflection points** - Schedule regular reviews (quarterly or semi-annually) to ask: "Were we actually candid enough over the past period?"

3. **Frame candor as a gift** - When delivering difficult feedback, help the recipient understand that you're sharing this because you care about their growth

4. **Create psychological safety first** - Candor without relationship trust feels harsh. Invest in the relationship so candor can land as intended

5. **Watch for "niceness" as a mask** - Notice when you or your team are being pleasant but avoiding the real issues. That's a signal to lean into candor.

## When to Use It

- When building company culture and defining values
- When you notice difficult conversations being avoided
- When giving performance feedback
- When coaching other leaders on communication
- When you find yourself wanting to delay bad news
- In hiring conversations where you need to assess fit honestly

Claire Vo expresses this concept as "Clear is kind" (from Brené Brown): "I think conflict-avoidant, feedback-avoidant cultures degrade the talent bar... I do not think that's kind. That is not setting up people for success in their careers." Her example of directly telling underperforming leaders "You are not meeting expectations. You will not be successful here if you continue on this path" demonstrates the framework in action—being direct IS being kind.
