# Founder Mode

> "Way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. They find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. That's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity." - Brian Chesky

## What It Is

Founder Mode is a leadership approach where founders remain deeply involved in product decisions and details rather than following conventional wisdom to "hire great people and get out of their way." It's a rejection of the common advice that founders should delegate product leadership to hired executives as companies scale.

The framework emerged from Brian Chesky's experience at Airbnb, where following traditional delegation advice led to bureaucracy, politics, slow product development, and a company where "a thousand people worked but it looked like nothing changed." After the COVID pandemic nearly killed the business, Chesky returned to deep product involvement and rebuilt the company around founder-led product development.

The key insight is that delegation without deep involvement creates a reactive leadership posture. Founders end up spending time adjudicating conflicts between divisions, managing politics, and being surprised by problems—rather than proactively shaping the product and company direction.

## How It Works

Founder Mode has several key characteristics:

**Stay in the Details**
- Review all product work personally on a regular cadence
- Know enough detail to evaluate if people are doing a good job
- Be able to identify bottlenecks and blocked individuals
- Distinguish between "micromanagement" (telling people what to do) and "being in the details" (understanding what's happening)

**Own the Product Function**
- CEO acts as Chief Product Officer (formally or informally)
- Don't hire a CPO to delegate product leadership
- Product-led founders should not step away from the thing they're best at

**Create One Shared Consciousness**
- All senior leaders maintain one continuous conversation
- Everyone rows in the same direction
- Single roadmap across the company
- No separate divisional roadmaps going in different directions

**Pull Decisions In, Don't Push Down**
- Stop pushing decision-making down to division leaders
- Create clarity by making decisions centrally
- Reduce politics by eliminating the need for influence-building

## How to Apply It

1. **Establish a review cadence** - Schedule regular reviews of all product work (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly depending on project phase)

2. **Consolidate to one roadmap** - Eliminate divisional roadmaps; create one company roadmap you personally review and update

3. **Reduce layers** - Minimize management layers between yourself and the work; treat your directs' directs as dotted-line reports

4. **Convert to functional** - Move from divisional structure (guest team, host team) to functional structure (design team, engineering team)

5. **Don't apologize** - Stop negotiating how to run the company; set clear expectations and let people opt in or out

6. **Accept the short-term cost** - Being deeply involved is more work initially, but creates compounding benefits as the team aligns

## When to Use It

- When your company feels slow despite adding more people
- When you're reacting to problems more than shaping direction
- When product development feels fragmented or inconsistent
- When you're spending time managing politics between divisions
- When the company ships lots of features but customers can't name anything you did
- During crisis or transformation when clarity is essential
- When you're a product-led founder who has delegated away your core strength

## When NOT to Use It

- If you're not a product-led founder, a different leadership model may work better
- If you genuinely have world-class product leadership you trust completely
- If you're running operations-heavy or sales-led businesses where product isn't the core driver
