# Doer to Editor Shift

> "You have to shift from doer to editor... You have to shift from, 'My job is to do the work,' to, 'My job is to make the work better. My job is to plus the work, to review the work, to help other people solve problems.'" - Fareed Mosavat

## What It Is

The Doer to Editor Shift describes the fundamental mindset change required when transitioning from individual contributor to manager. As a doer, your value comes from the work you personally produce. As an editor, your value comes from improving the work others produce.

This shift is counterintuitive because you were promoted for being an excellent doer. Your instinct is to keep doing—just at a larger scale. But this approach doesn't scale and prevents your team from growing. The editor mindset creates leverage by multiplying your impact through others.

## How It Works

### Doer Mindset (IC)
- "How can I produce the best work?"
- "Let me take this on—I can do it faster"
- "I need to be in the details to ensure quality"
- Success = personal output

### Editor Mindset (Manager)
- "How can I make this work better?"
- "How can I help them solve this problem?"
- "What's the minimum input I can provide for maximum improvement?"
- Success = team output

### The Shift in Practice

**Think in terms of laziness (ROI):**
> "What's the least amount of work I could do to make this thing as good as possible?" versus "How do I do as much work as possible to make sure it's great?"

This isn't about being lazy—it's about being strategic with your involvement. Every hour you spend doing work is an hour you're not spending multiplying your team's effectiveness.

## How to Apply It

1. **Calibrate your involvement to the person:** Not everyone needs the same level of input.
   - **Delegate fully:** "You're great at this. Go solve it, call me if you hit a wall."
   - **Coach:** "Here's how I'd think about this problem..."
   - **Direct:** "Here's exactly what needs to happen..."

   Match your approach to where each person is in their expertise and ownership.

2. **Review, don't redo:** When you see work that isn't quite right, resist the urge to take it over. Give feedback and let them iterate.

3. **Ask questions instead of giving answers:** "What options did you consider?" helps them develop judgment better than "Do it this way."

4. **Be the last person to speak:** Let your team share ideas before you share yours. Once the boss speaks, the discussion often ends.

5. **Schedule time for editing:** Block time specifically for reviewing work, providing feedback, and helping people think through problems.

## The Leverage Equation

As a doer: Your impact = Your hours × Your productivity

As an editor: Your impact = (Team hours × Team productivity) + Your direct contribution

The math is clear: multiplying a team's output beats maximizing your personal output.

## When to Use It

- During first transition from IC to manager
- When feeling overwhelmed by trying to do everything yourself
- When your team seems dependent on you for decisions
- When you catch yourself thinking "I can just do this faster"
