# Fortune Five Million

> "The Fortune 5 million versus the Fortune 500." - Jason Fried

## What It Is

Fortune Five Million is a market positioning strategy: instead of chasing enterprise customers (the Fortune 500), build products for the millions of small businesses that exist everywhere in the world.

This isn't a consolation prize market—it's a deliberately chosen one with distinct advantages. Small businesses are more numerous, often underserved, require simpler products, have shorter sales cycles, and don't demand the extensive customization and hand-holding that enterprise customers expect.

The approach fundamentally shapes everything else about your business: product design (simpler), pricing (lower, simpler), support (self-service), sales (none or minimal), and company size (can stay small yourself).

## How It Works

**Fortune 500 Approach**:
- High touch sales process (months, years)
- Extensive customization demands
- Complex pricing with enterprise tiers
- Required security certifications
- Account managers for each customer
- Build what big customers ask for
- A few customers paying huge amounts

**Fortune 5 Million Approach**:
- Self-service signup (minutes)
- One product for everyone
- Simple, transparent pricing
- Standard security (enough for SMB)
- Support, but not dedicated accounts
- Build what most businesses need
- Many customers paying modest amounts

**Why It Works**:
- There are millions of small businesses globally
- Most software is overbuilt for their needs
- They can't afford Fortune 500 pricing anyway
- They don't want enterprise complexity
- They're more loyal (less vendor evaluation culture)
- No one customer can hold you hostage

## How to Apply It

1. **Know your customer**: Who are you really building for? Small teams that need to get work done, not IT departments that need compliance checkboxes.

2. **Price appropriately**: If a Fortune 5 million customer is paying more than a few hundred dollars a month, you're probably building the wrong product.

3. **Eliminate sales**: Your product should sell itself. If it requires a salesperson, you've overbuilt.

4. **Build one version**: No enterprise tier. No custom features for big customers. One product serves everyone.

5. **Accept the ceiling**: You probably won't build a $10B company this way. You might build a very profitable $100M one.

6. **Design for simplicity**: Fortune 5 million customers don't have time to learn complex software. Make it obvious.

## When to Use It

- Choosing your target market
- Deciding whether to build enterprise features
- Setting pricing strategy
- Designing product complexity
- Deciding whether to hire salespeople
