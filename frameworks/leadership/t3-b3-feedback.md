# T3 B3 Feedback

> "We had a system called T3 B3, where during reviews or pulse check-ins, you'd have to say three positives about your manager and three constructive pieces of feedback for your manager... Travis came over, 'This is totally unacceptable. You have to provide constructive feedback,' which made me super uncomfortable but created the right environment, where people could have these tough conversations." - Keith Yandell

## What It Is

A structured feedback system where both positive (T = Top/good) and constructive (B = Bottom/improvement) feedback are mandatory, not optional. By requiring constructive feedback, the system removes the social friction of volunteering criticism—everyone is expected to do it, so no one can be singled out for being "negative."

Keith learned this at Uber under Travis Kalanick. The key insight: making constructive feedback mandatory creates psychological safety because people can't be punished for following the rule.

## How It Works

### The Structure

During reviews or regular pulse check-ins:
- **T3**: Three positive things about your manager/peer/report
- **B3**: Three constructive/critical things about your manager/peer/report

Both are required. Skipping the constructive feedback is "unacceptable."

### Why Mandatory Matters

Keith describes his first experience with T3 B3. He only provided the positives for his manager, the General Counsel at Uber. Travis Kalanick intervened directly: "This is totally unacceptable. You have to provide constructive feedback."

This made Keith uncomfortable—but that discomfort served a purpose:

> "It created the right environment, where people could have these tough conversations because, 'My manager can't get mad at me, because she knows the CEO's going to come give me a hard time if I don't provide some constructive feedback.'"

The top-level enforcement gave everyone cover to be honest.

### How to Receive It

Getting constructive feedback is hard. Keith emphasizes:

1. **Thank them for it** - Genuinely express gratitude
2. **Action it** - Actually make changes based on what you hear
3. **Close the loop** - Come back and report: "You said X. Here's what I changed. Is it better?"

> "If you create a space where you require constructive feedback, it's a lot easier to give feedback."

## How to Apply It

1. **Make it structural** - Build T3 B3 into your review process, not as optional "room for feedback"

2. **Enforce it from the top** - Leaders must model giving and requiring constructive feedback

3. **Create explicit space in one-on-ones** - Keith dedicates time in every one-on-one specifically for feedback exchange

4. **Demand feedback for yourself** - "I expect constructive feedback. If you don't give it to me, I'm going to press you."

5. **Action what you hear** - Nothing kills honest feedback faster than ignoring it

6. **Report back** - "This was our lowest performing area in the pulse survey. Here are the three things we did to action it."

### The Feedback Loop

> "We got feedback from a customer or from another business line, you would say, 'Heard it. We're going to come back and report out on what we're going to do differently, and then we're going to track the progress.' And so I think that's really important when you receive feedback."

Treat internal feedback with the same rigor you'd treat customer feedback.

## When to Use It

- **Performance reviews** - The natural moment for comprehensive feedback
- **Regular one-on-ones** - Build it into your recurring meeting structure
- **Pulse surveys** - Require constructive input, not just satisfaction scores
- **360 reviews** - Make the "areas for improvement" section mandatory
- **Team retrospectives** - Require both "what went well" and "what to improve"

## Common Failure Modes

**Soft-pedaled constructive feedback**: "Maybe consider..." doesn't count. Push for specifics.

**No action taken**: If feedback disappears into a void, people stop giving it.

**Retaliation (explicit or subtle)**: Any negative consequence for honest feedback destroys the system.

**Leaders exempt themselves**: If it only flows downward, it's not a feedback culture.
