# Peak Hierarchy Model

> "The employee model is really simple. It's money or compensation at the base, recognition in the middle, and meaning at the top." - Chip Conley

## What It Is

The Peak Hierarchy Model adapts Maslow's hierarchy of needs to create three distinct pyramids for the key stakeholders in any business: employees, customers, and investors. Rather than treating all needs as equal, this framework recognizes that needs are hierarchical—basic needs must be met before higher-level needs become motivating.

For employees, the pyramid moves from compensation (survival needs) to recognition (belonging and esteem) to meaning (self-actualization). For customers, it progresses from meeting expectations to meeting desires to meeting unrecognized needs. This framework helps leaders understand that differentiation often happens at the higher levels of the pyramid, not the base.

## How It Works

### Employee Pyramid

1. **Money/Compensation (Base)** - Salary, benefits, financial security
2. **Recognition (Middle)** - Acknowledgment, appreciation, feeling valued
3. **Meaning (Top)** - Purpose, connection to mission, fulfilling work

### Customer Pyramid

1. **Meeting Expectations (Base)** - Product does what it says
2. **Meeting Desires (Middle)** - Product delivers what customers want
3. **Meeting Unrecognized Needs (Top)** - Product addresses needs customers didn't know they had

The relative size of each layer varies by context:

- **Sales jobs**: Money often dominates the pyramid (90%)
- **Nonprofits**: Money is thin, meaning is huge
- **Tech companies**: Recognition and meaning become key differentiators

## How to Apply It

1. **Map your organization's current pyramid** - Where are you investing across money, recognition, and meaning? Is there a gap at any level?

2. **Identify your differentiator** - Competition often focuses on the base (compensation, meeting expectations). Win at the higher levels.

3. **For employees**: Ask "Do people feel recognized? Do they find meaning in their work?" Fix lower levels first before expecting higher-level engagement.

4. **For customers**: Move beyond expectations to ask "What do customers actually desire?" and ultimately "What need do they have that they don't even know about yet?"

5. **Use it for strategic clarity** - Airbnb used this to realize they weren't in "home sharing" (meeting expectations) but in "belonging anywhere" (meeting unrecognized needs). This became an organizing principle for everything from host training to marketing.

## When to Use It

- Diagnosing employee engagement problems
- Building company culture and defining values
- Designing customer experience strategies
- Positioning products beyond functional benefits
- Helping managers understand motivation beyond compensation
