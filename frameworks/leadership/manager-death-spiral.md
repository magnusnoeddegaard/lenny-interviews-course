# Manager Death Spiral

> "You got there by being the best IC on the team probably, so your instincts are to, 'I see a bunch of important stuff,' and do management stuff too." - Fareed Mosavat

## What It Is

The Manager Death Spiral is a failure pattern that afflicts new managers who were previously high-performing individual contributors. When promoted, they inherit broader responsibility but continue operating with IC instincts—keeping the most interesting and high-leverage work for themselves while delegating only the tedious, low-impact tasks to their team.

This creates a spiral of failure:
- The manager becomes overworked and becomes a bottleneck
- Team members get demoralized working on uninteresting tasks
- Team members don't learn or grow because they're denied real opportunities
- The manager gets more stressed and takes on even more work
- Quality suffers across the board

The spiral is particularly dangerous because the instincts driving it—taking ownership, ensuring quality, working hard—are exactly what made the person successful as an IC.

## How It Works

**The Pattern:**
1. High-performing IC gets promoted to manage a team
2. Manager inherits responsibility across multiple projects
3. Manager identifies the "most interesting and valuable projects"
4. Manager keeps those for themselves: "I can only have one person on my team to go dive in and work on those things to make a lot of leverage"
5. Team members get the least interesting, least leveraged work
6. Manager is now doing IC work PLUS management work
7. Manager is overworked, team is blocked, quality suffers
8. Repeat

**Why It Happens:**
- You got promoted for being a great IC, so you trust your IC instincts
- "I can do this myself faster than I can explain it to someone else, so I'll just do it"
- You genuinely care about quality and worry others won't meet your standards
- You think you're helping by taking the hard stuff

## How to Apply It

### Recognize the warning signs:
- You're working 60+ hours and still can't keep up
- Your team is waiting on you for decisions
- You're the only one who knows how certain things work
- Team members seem disengaged or bored
- You can't take vacation without things falling apart

### Break the spiral:

1. **Shift from doer to editor:** Your job is no longer to do the work—it's to make the work better. Plus the work, review the work, help others solve problems.

2. **Start thinking in terms of laziness (ROI):** "What's the least amount of work I could do to make this thing as good as possible?" versus "How do I do as much work as possible to make sure it's great?"

3. **Trust people with interesting work:** Yes, it will be painful at first. Yes, they might do it differently than you would. But this is the only way they learn, and the only way you scale.

4. **Match input level to the person:**
   - Some people need you to be directive: "Here's exactly what to do"
   - Some people need coaching: "Here's how to think about it"
   - Some people just need delegation: "Go solve this, call me if you hit a problem"

5. **Own the outcome, not the resources:** Your job isn't to maximize what you can do with the team you have. It's to propose what resources you need to maximize impact.

## When to Use It

- During your first transition from IC to manager
- When feeling overwhelmed by too many responsibilities
- When your team seems underutilized or disengaged
- When you're the bottleneck for decisions and reviews
