# Culture as Calcification

> "I think of culture as calcification. So calcification being the limestone that is built up as water runs over and that sort of thing. And in order to fix it, you can kind of chip it off over time. You can't just fix it all in one go." - Janna Bastow

## What It Is

Culture as Calcification is a mental model for understanding why organizational change is so difficult at larger companies, and how to approach transformation realistically. Just as limestone builds up layer by layer over years as water deposits minerals, organizational culture hardens incrementally through repeated behaviors, incentives, and decisions.

The metaphor provides both a diagnosis (why change is hard) and a prescription (how to approach it). You can't dissolve years of calcified culture with a single initiative - you have to chip away at it gradually, starting with small pockets of change.

## How It Works

**Why Culture Calcifies:**

- Every decision reinforces certain behaviors and discourages others
- Incentive structures become self-perpetuating
- "The way we do things" becomes unquestioned
- People who succeeded under the old culture rise to leadership positions
- New hires are selected and socialized to fit the existing culture

**The Calcification Paradox:**

Large companies often have the resources to change but the least ability to do so:
- They're incentivized for stability (quarter-over-quarter growth)
- Leadership is rewarded for maintaining the status quo
- Risk of disruption threatens short-term metrics
- Yet startups are chipping away at their most valuable business lines

## How to Apply It

1. **Accept you can't change everything at once** - Stop trying to transform the whole organization in one initiative. That's fighting physics.

2. **Find a small pocket to start** - Identify a team, division, or "startup lab" where you can establish new ways of working without fighting the full weight of existing culture.

3. **Get a "shit hot leader"** - Find someone who understands the new approach and can shield their team from organizational antibodies.

4. **Let success spread** - Once one pocket succeeds, adjacent teams become curious. Let them learn from the first team rather than mandating change from above.

5. **Build coalitions** - As multiple pockets adopt new practices, they can band together: "We've got a whole thing going here. Let's talk to the VP of strategy."

6. **Secure buy-in from above** - Eventually you need executive sponsorship, but it's easier to get when you can point to working examples within the organization.

## When to Use It

- When leading transformation initiatives at large organizations
- When frustrated by slow pace of organizational change
- When planning how to introduce new practices (agile, discovery, Now Next Later roadmapping)
- When deciding whether to mandate change or let it spread organically

## The Warning Signs of Excessive Calcification

- "That's not how we do things here"
- Incentives that reward short-term metrics over long-term health
- Leaders who rose under the old system protecting it
- Innovation initiatives that get absorbed back into the mothership
- Startups successfully attacking pieces of your business
