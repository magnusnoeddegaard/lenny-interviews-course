# Range Leadership (Generalists for 10x Outcomes)

> "If you want to achieve a 10x outcome, hiring someone that's an expert in the field, it's maybe unlikely you're going to achieve that 10x outcome, because they're likely to do things the way things have always been done. So you might achieve incremental benefits, but the odds of completely reinventing the system and doing something that's vastly superior to others is much lower." - Keith Yandell (quoting Tony Xu)

## What It Is

A leadership principle that deliberately places non-experts in charge of functions, betting that their lack of conventional expertise will lead to breakthrough innovation rather than incremental improvement.

The idea comes from David Epstein's book *Range*, which argues that generalists outperform specialists, particularly in complex, unpredictable domains. Nobel Prize winners, for example, are often accomplished in fields unrelated to their winning work. Cross-domain thinking enables novel approaches that specialists, trapped by "how it's always been done," cannot see.

At DoorDash, this means putting a lawyer (Keith Yandell) in charge of HR, marketing, and customer support—not in spite of his lack of expertise, but because of it.

## How It Works

### The DoorDash Application

Keith Yandell joined DoorDash as Chief Legal Officer. Over time, Tony Xu asked him to lead:
- HR (1,500+ person org)
- Customer Support
- Marketing
- BD and Corporate Development

Keith initially resisted, experiencing massive imposter syndrome. Tony's response: "I know you don't know how to do this stuff. That's why I'm putting you in the role."

### Why Non-Experts Can Lead Better

1. **No "industry standard" baggage** - They question practices that experts take for granted
2. **Fresh perspectives** - They bring mental models from other domains
3. **Beginner's mind** - They ask "dumb questions" that turn out to be important
4. **Humility-based hiring** - They know they need great specialists, so they hire the best

### The Specialist + Generalist Partnership

The model isn't "generalists instead of specialists"—it's generalist leaders who hire and empower specialist executors:

- Keith (generalist leader) hired Kofi Amoo-Gottfried (marketing specialist) as head of brand
- Keith provided strategic direction and organizational support
- Kofi brought deep marketing expertise and eventually became CMO
- The combination produced better results than either alone

### How Generalist Leaders Add Value

1. **Cross-functional perspective** - They've seen patterns across multiple domains
2. **First principles thinking** - They derive solutions from fundamentals, not playbooks
3. **Organizational navigation** - They understand how the whole company works
4. **Talent attraction** - Good specialists want autonomy; generalist leaders give it
5. **Succession building** - They're explicitly developing their replacements

## How to Apply It

1. **Overcome imposter syndrome first** - Read *Range* by David Epstein. Understand intellectually that non-expertise can be an advantage before trying it.

2. **Be transparent about your gaps** - Tell your team: "Good news, bad news. I don't know your field anywhere near as well as you do. Here's the ways I intend to help you."

3. **Hire the best specialists** - Your job is to find people better than you at the function and get out of their way.

4. **Add value where you can** - You bring fresh eyes, cross-functional connections, and organizational context.

5. **Plan to shrink your role** - Success means developing successors and eventually handing off. Keith went from 1,500 people to 12.

6. **Focus on 10x thinking** - Constantly ask: "What would a revolutionary improvement look like?" vs. "How can we get 10% better?"

## When to Use It

- **Building a new function** - When there's no established playbook to follow
- **Seeking breakthrough innovation** - When incremental improvement isn't enough
- **Shaking up a stagnant team** - When "industry best practices" have plateaued
- **Developing future leaders** - Rotation through unfamiliar functions builds range
- **Attracting ambitious specialists** - Top talent wants autonomy and room to grow

## When NOT to Use It

- **Highly regulated functions** - Some roles require credentialed experts (medical, legal compliance)
- **Mature, optimized systems** - If you just need solid execution, hire specialists
- **Crisis stabilization** - Sometimes you need someone who's done exactly this before

## The Payoff

Keith's track record at DoorDash:
- Built multiple functions from scratch
- Developed leaders like Kofi (now CMO) and Tia (now GC)
- Brought fresh thinking that specialists might not have risked
- Created a pipeline of future leaders through the same model
