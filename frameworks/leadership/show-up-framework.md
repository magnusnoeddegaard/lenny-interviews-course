# Show Up Framework

> "Show up, and you're ahead of 80% of the people in the free world. Show up on time, and you're ahead of 85% of the people in the free world. Show up on time with a plan, and you're ahead of 90% of the people in the free world. And if somehow you have the guts to put that plan to action with a smile, then you probably will have a great chance of success." - Christian Idiodi (quoting his father)

## What It Is

The Show Up Framework is a compounding success model taught to Christian Idiodi by his father. It breaks down success into four progressive levels, each one giving you an edge over more people. The insight is that success isn't about being brilliant—it's about consistently executing basics that most people skip.

## How It Works

### The Four Levels

| Level | Action | Percentile |
|-------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Show up | Top 20% |
| 2 | Show up on time | Top 15% |
| 3 | Show up on time with a plan | Top 10% |
| 4 | Execute the plan with a smile | Great chance of success |

### The Compounding Effect

Each level builds on the previous:
- Level 1 alone beats 80% of people
- Adding Level 2 beats another 5%
- Adding Level 3 beats another 5%
- Level 4 creates the conditions for actual success

### Why Each Level Matters

1. **Show up** - Most people don't even try. They stay home, make excuses, or ghost.

2. **On time** - Showing up late signals disrespect and disorganization. Being on time is a form of preparation.

3. **With a plan** - Having a plan means you thought ahead. Most people wing it.

4. **With a smile** - Positive energy is contagious. Execution with enthusiasm attracts support and opportunities.

## How to Apply It

1. **Commit to showing up** - Say yes, then actually appear. Physically or virtually, be present.

2. **Be early** - Treat punctuality as non-negotiable. Plan for delays.

3. **Prepare in advance** - Know what you want to accomplish before you arrive. Write it down.

4. **Bring positive energy** - Execute your plan with enthusiasm, not dread. Smile.

5. **Repeat consistently** - This isn't a one-time hack. It's a daily practice across every aspect of your life.

## When to Use It

- **Starting a new job** - Build reputation through consistent basics
- **Pursuing a new opportunity** - Most competition eliminates itself
- **Building habits** - Focus on showing up before optimizing performance
- **Coaching others** - Diagnose which level they're failing at
- **Recovering from setbacks** - Return to fundamentals
