# Run Toward Fear

> "The biggest mistake that you make, the worst thing that you do as a leader, there's things in your control and there's things out of your control and hesitation, that's generally the most destructive." - Ben Horowitz

## What It Is

Run Toward Fear is a leadership philosophy that addresses the most destructive behavior CEOs and leaders engage in: hesitation. When faced with two terrible options, the natural human response is to avoid the decision entirely. But this hesitation is worse than either bad choice.

The psychological muscle required for great leadership is the ability to look into the abyss, recognize that one path is slightly better than another, and commit fully to that direction—even when both options are painful and everyone will criticize the decision.

Ben Horowitz developed this principle through his experience as CEO of LoudCloud/Opsware, where he faced numerous impossible choices, including taking the company public with only $2 million in trailing 12-month revenue at 18 months old. The alternative—bankruptcy—was worse.

## How It Works

The framework operates on a core insight: when both options are horrible, the leader's instinct is to avoid the decision altogether. This creates three problems:

1. **Decision paralysis** - The company can't move forward while waiting
2. **Organizational anxiety** - Employees know something is wrong and lose confidence
3. **Political dysfunction** - Senior people start vying for power in the leadership vacuum

**The Psychology of Hesitation:**
- Business school teaches that decisions have clear right answers
- Real CEO decisions involve choosing between two terrible options
- Example: "Rearchitect the product and miss the quarter, or ship broken architecture and fail later"
- The natural response is avoidance: "I don't even want to deal with either of those"

**Why Running Toward Fear Works:**
- Action provides clarity, even when the action is painful
- Decisions can be adjusted; paralysis cannot
- Teams rally around decisive leadership, even on unpopular calls
- "The only value you ever add is when you make a decision that most people don't like"

## How to Apply It

1. **Recognize the hesitation signal** - Notice when you're avoiding a topic or decision because both outcomes are bad

2. **Accept that both options are terrible** - Stop looking for a good option that doesn't exist

3. **Calculate which is slightly less bad** - Not which is good, but which is incrementally better

4. **Commit fully to the less-bad path** - Half-measures and hedging destroy the benefit of deciding

5. **Prepare for criticism** - The Wall Street Journal wrote that Ben was stupid; Businessweek called it "the IPO from Hell." But the company survived.

6. **Trust what you see** - "If you don't trust your eyes and you don't run at it, then you're just not going to be good"

## When to Use It

- When facing two options that both feel terrible
- When you notice yourself avoiding a difficult conversation or decision
- When the organization seems stuck or anxious about an unaddressed issue
- When senior employees are starting to fill the leadership vacuum themselves
- When you need to fire someone, restructure, or make an unpopular strategic pivot

## Common Applications

**Firing decisions:**
"Should I fire the head of sales? I don't want to have that conversation. And then I'll have to replace them. And then there's going to be a bad PR story. You can kind of quickly calculate all the bad stuff that's going to happen if you do it. But if you don't do it, that's probably going to be much worse."

**Architecture decisions:**
Deciding whether to rearchitect a product (and miss quarters) or continue with broken architecture (and fail long-term).

**Funding decisions:**
Going public with inadequate revenue because the alternative (bankruptcy) is worse.
