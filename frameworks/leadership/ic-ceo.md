# IC CEO

> "The underlying reason for this shift, at least for me, is that, as we started the company, I was very much in this mode. I was literally writing code both on the backend, thinking about the real time data architecture of our platform, also the front end, the UX." - Howie Liu

## What It Is

IC CEO describes the emerging trend of chief executives returning to hands-on, individual contributor work—particularly in the AI era. Rather than delegating all product details to executives and managing from dashboards, these CEOs actively build prototypes, use AI tools daily, and stay deeply involved in product decisions.

This represents a departure from the conventional wisdom that scaled companies need CEOs who "step away from the details" and focus purely on strategy, hiring, and investor relations. The IC CEO model argues that in rapidly evolving technology landscapes, founders who lose touch with the product lose the ability to make the right strategic calls.

## How It Works

The IC CEO model has several key components:

**1. Daily Tool Usage**
- Use AI products multiple times per hour, not just occasionally
- Experiment with both your own product and competitors
- Create weekend projects to force deep engagement with new tools

**2. Hands-On Building**
- Build prototypes and demos personally
- Share working artifacts instead of just documents
- Lead by example by showing, not telling, how to use new capabilities

**3. Reduced Standing Meetings**
- Cut one-on-one roster to create time for product work
- Make meetings timely and insight-driven rather than ritualistic
- Use a "barbell approach": deep, in-person relationship building OR timely topic discussions

**4. Acting as Chief Tastemaker**
- Maintain the final say on product UX decisions
- "Taste the soup" by experiencing the product firsthand
- Understand both the packaged product AND the underlying capabilities

## How to Apply It

Actionable steps for becoming an IC CEO:

1. **Block time for building** - Cancel recurring meetings and use that time for hands-on work with your product and AI tools
2. **Become your own power user** - Track your usage metrics; aim to be among the top users of your own product
3. **Create and share artifacts** - Instead of writing memos, create landing pages, prototypes, or chat threads and share the process
4. **Give permission to play** - Tell your team to take days or weeks to explore AI products—and mean it
5. **Lead by example** - Share screenshots, links, and discoveries from your own experimentation

## When to Use It

This model is especially important when:

- Your company is going through a major technology transition (like the AI shift)
- Product-market fit needs to be refound, not just maintained
- The underlying technology capabilities are evolving rapidly
- Competitors are AI-native startups shipping weekly

It may be less applicable for:
- Highly mature businesses in stable markets
- Companies where the CEO's strengths are genuinely elsewhere
- Situations requiring intense external focus (major fundraising, M&A)
