# Trust Battery

> "It's through that almost back and forth, the trust battery thing that I was talking about plays in. Again, they're selling it to their peers, the engineering directors. They're selling it to the VPs. They're selling it to the broad team as well to get momentum behind it." - Brandon Chu

## What It Is

The Trust Battery is a mental model for understanding and managing professional relationships. Coined at Shopify, it visualizes trust between two people as a battery with a charge level from 0-100%. Every interaction either charges or drains the battery.

When you first meet someone, your trust battery starts at around 50%. Over time, through actions—delivering on commitments, making good decisions, collaborating effectively—the battery charges up. Broken promises, poor decisions, or lack of follow-through drain it.

The battery level determines how much autonomy you're given, how easily your ideas are accepted, and how much benefit of the doubt you receive. A high trust battery means your proposals get greenlit faster. A low one means more scrutiny and oversight.

## How It Works

**Battery Levels:**
- **0-25%** - Low trust. Every decision requires justification and approval. Heavy oversight.
- **25-50%** - New relationship. Still proving yourself. Ideas face skepticism.
- **50-75%** - Working trust. Reasonable autonomy. Proposals get fair consideration.
- **75-100%** - High trust. Significant autonomy. Benefit of the doubt on most decisions.

**Charging Activities:**
- Delivering results on commitments
- Making good decisions, especially under pressure
- Being transparent about challenges early
- Supporting others' success
- Sharing credit generously

**Draining Activities:**
- Missing deadlines or commitments
- Making poor decisions repeatedly
- Hiding problems until they explode
- Taking credit for others' work
- Being unreliable or inconsistent

## How to Apply It

1. **Assess your current battery levels** - With each key stakeholder, honestly evaluate where you stand (0-100%). This determines what strategies you need.

2. **Invest in low batteries first** - If you have important stakeholders with low trust batteries, prioritize charging those relationships before taking on new initiatives.

3. **Make deposits before withdrawals** - Before asking for something significant (budget, headcount, scope change), ensure you've made recent deposits to the trust battery.

4. **Understand it's individual, not collective** - Your trust battery with the CEO is separate from your trust battery with your peer. Manage each relationship individually.

5. **Don't assume it transfers** - Trust built in one context (e.g., executing well) doesn't automatically transfer to another (e.g., strategic thinking). You may need to build trust in each dimension.

## When to Use It

- **Before proposing big initiatives** - Check your trust battery with decision-makers first
- **When onboarding somewhere new** - Accept that you start at 50% and need to prove yourself
- **When receiving unexpected resistance** - Consider whether a low trust battery explains it
- **When evaluating team dynamics** - Use it to diagnose relationship issues
- **When delegating or empowering others** - Match autonomy to trust battery levels

**Farhan's additional insights:**
- Toby Lutke starts everyone at 50% and builds from there
- Some leaders start new hires at 100% ("high charging teams") and only deplete if off-alignment
- The terminology becomes shorthand for figuring out how to work with somebody
- Trust battery can "recharge" through intentional IRL experiences like Shopify Summit and bursts
