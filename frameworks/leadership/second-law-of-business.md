# Second Law of Business (Fighting Entropy)

> "In lay person's terms, the second law of thermodynamics is that over time, unless you intervene, everything goes to crap. The amount of disorder and randomness in a system is going to increase over time. This happens in companies as well, at almost every level of abstraction." - Dharmesh Shah

## What It Is

The Second Law of Business applies the physics principle of entropy to organizations: within any closed system, disorder increases over time. In business terms, this means complexity naturally grows unless you actively fight against it.

Dharmesh Shah identifies three stages of company battles:
1. **Stage 1**: Fighting to survive (don't die)
2. **Stage 2**: Fighting not to stagnate (keep growing)
3. **Stage 3**: Fighting complexity (don't crumble under your own weight)

Complexity kills companies more reliably than other threats—it just does so more slowly. Everything gets harder: more management layers, more headcount needed, margins compress, decisions slow down.

## How It Works

Entropy manifests in business as:

- **Code entropy**: Codebases become harder to work with over time
- **Product entropy**: Products become bloated with features
- **Process entropy**: Processes accumulate steps and approvals
- **Communication entropy**: More people means exponentially more coordination
- **Decision entropy**: Decisions require more stakeholders and take longer

The key insight is that even well-intentioned people naturally introduce complexity. Everyone wants more tiers in pricing, more knobs in the product, more nuance in policies. This is the natural way of the world.

## How to Apply It

1. **Make "Fight for Simplicity" a core value** - Literally those three words. The message: simplicity is worth fighting for, AND it requires fighting for.

2. **One in, one out rule** - For every feature/dial/knob added to a product, remove one. Even if they're not equivalent, the constraint forces thinking.

3. **Binary decisions over nuanced ones** - "Everything or nothing" is much simpler than complex access rules. At HubSpot, transparency means everyone sees everything—no gradations.

4. **Start simple, add complexity only when it breaks** - Keep doing the simple thing until it demonstrably fails, then add the minimum complexity needed.

5. **Build systems, not just culture** - Put guardrails and constraints into systems. Amazon calls them "mechanisms." Culture deteriorates; well-designed systems persist.

6. **Account for third-order costs** - When evaluating new products/features, count not just development cost and maintenance cost, but the dimensional complexity added to every future decision.

## When to Use It

- When evaluating whether to add a new product line (dimensional complexity)
- When considering adding features, tiers, or options
- When building processes and policies
- When the organization feels slow or bureaucratic
- At any scale—it's never too early to plant seeds of simplicity

The framework is particularly valuable because it:
- Explains why things naturally get harder (it's physics, not failure)
- Reframes simplicity from "nice to have" to "existential"
- Provides ammunition to push back on well-intentioned complexity additions
- Makes the case that fighting complexity requires active, continuous effort
