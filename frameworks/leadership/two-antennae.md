# Two Antennae

> "We're all equipped with two antennae. One is tracking what's going on for me, my internal antenna. The other one is trying to pick up signals on what might be going on for you. Recognizing those two antennae exist. Second of all, learning how to hone our ability to pick up subtler and subtler signals make us more interpersonally competent." - Carole Robin

## What It Is

The Two Antennae framework describes the two channels of awareness that enable interpersonal competence: one antenna tracks your own internal state (thoughts, feelings, reactions), and the other antenna picks up signals about what's happening for others (their emotions, needs, responses).

Most people have poorly calibrated antennae. Some are very attuned to others but disconnected from themselves. Others are hyper-aware of their own experience but miss signals from people around them. The most interpersonally competent people have developed both antennae and can pick up increasingly subtle signals on both channels.

This framework is foundational to all other interpersonal skills: you can't give good feedback if you don't know how you're feeling, and you can't respond appropriately to others if you can't read their signals.

## How It Works

**Antenna #1: Internal (Self-Awareness)**

What it tracks:
- Your emotional state (am I feeling anxious, excited, frustrated?)
- Your physical reactions (tension, energy, fatigue)
- Your mental responses (am I judging, defending, curious?)
- Your patterns (do I always react this way?)

When it's underdeveloped:
- You're surprised by your own reactions
- You don't know why you said something
- Emotions seem to "just happen" to you
- You can't articulate what you're feeling

**Antenna #2: External (Other-Awareness)**

What it tracks:
- Others' emotional states
- Nonverbal signals (posture, tone, eye contact)
- Energy shifts in conversations
- What's not being said

When it's underdeveloped:
- You miss when someone is upset
- You're surprised by others' reactions to you
- You don't notice when you've lost someone's attention
- Feedback from others blindsides you

**Calibrating Both Antennae:**

The goal is to pick up subtler and subtler signals on both channels. This isn't natural for most people—it requires practice and intentional development. Meditation and mindfulness practices specifically develop Antenna #1; active listening and empathy exercises develop Antenna #2.

## How to Apply It

**Strengthen Antenna #1 (Self-Awareness):**

1. **Pause regularly** - Create moments throughout the day to check in with yourself
2. **Name your emotions** - Use a vocabulary of feelings to articulate what you're experiencing
3. **Notice body signals** - Tension, breathing changes, and energy levels carry information
4. **Reflect after interactions** - What did you feel? When did it shift?
5. **Practice meditation** - Develops the muscle of noticing internal states

**Strengthen Antenna #2 (Other-Awareness):**

1. **Watch for nonverbals** - Eye contact, posture, tone often say more than words
2. **Notice energy shifts** - When does someone lean in or pull back?
3. **Check assumptions** - Ask "What did you hear me say?" instead of assuming
4. **Listen for what's not said** - What topics are being avoided?
5. **Ask for feedback** - "How did that land for you?"

**Use Both Simultaneously:**

In important conversations, toggle between both antennae:
- What am I feeling right now? (Antenna #1)
- What signals is this person giving me? (Antenna #2)
- How might my state be affecting my read of them?
- How might their signals be affecting my state?

## When to Use It

- During difficult conversations
- When giving or receiving feedback
- In meetings where dynamics seem off
- When you notice yourself getting triggered
- As a leadership development priority
- When building trust with new people
