# Story-Driven Leadership

> "The most effective stories are the ones that we tell ourselves. They may or may not be true; our brain doesn't know the difference. Once you can really understand that, you may as well leverage it to be that hero." - Donna Lichaw

## What It Is

Story-driven leadership is an approach that recognizes the stories we tell ourselves—not the stories we tell others—are what most powerfully shape our leadership effectiveness. While leaders are often told they need to be better "storytellers" to influence their teams, the real leverage comes from examining and rewriting the internal narratives that drive behavior.

Our brains are pattern-recognition machines designed to see stories everywhere. This is a feature, not a bug—it's how we make sense of complex situations. But the stories we unconsciously construct about ourselves ("I'm too nice," "No one listens to me," "I'll never learn to be a real CEO") become self-fulfilling prophecies that constrain our potential.

The framework flips the common advice on its head: instead of starting with how to better influence others through external storytelling, start with yourself at the center. When you understand and rewrite your own stories first, you become more grounded, purposeful, and effective at bringing others along on your journey.

## How It Works

**The Inside-Out Model**

Leadership effectiveness flows from the inside out through concentric circles:

1. **Self** (innermost) - Understanding your own stories, superpowers, and kryptonite
2. **One-on-One Relationships** - Connecting authentically with individuals
3. **Teams and Groups** - Leading collective efforts
4. **Business/Organization** (outermost) - Driving organizational impact

You cannot effectively lead at the outer circles if the inner circles are unstable. A leader who hasn't examined their own limiting stories will project those constraints onto every interaction.

**Common Story Types That Hold Leaders Back**

- **Identity Stories**: "I'm too nice," "I'm not technical enough," "I'm an imposter"
- **Predictive Stories**: "They'll never go for it," "This won't work"
- **Horror Stories**: "We're never going to make it," "I'll never learn this"

**The Story Validation Process**

1. **Surface the story** - What are you telling yourself about this situation?
2. **Test with data** - Is this story actually true? Talk to your "customers" (colleagues, team members)
3. **Identify what's really happening** - Often the feedback reveals a different reality
4. **Co-create a better ending** - Work with your team to rewrite the narrative

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your recurring stories** - Notice what you tell yourself when things get hard. Write these down without judgment.

2. **Take a data-driven approach** - Treat your stories like hypotheses. Go talk to your team or colleagues to validate or invalidate them. Ask questions like: "How do you experience working with me?" "What do you need from me that you're not getting?"

3. **Look for the disconnect** - Often there's a gap between the story you're telling yourself and how others actually experience you. A CEO who thinks "no one listens to me" may discover his team actually wants less direction, not more.

4. **Rewrite the story together** - Once you understand the true situation, collaborate on a better ending. This isn't about positive affirmations—it's about replacing inaccurate limiting stories with accurate empowering ones.

5. **Start with you, not them** - Resist the urge to fix your team before fixing your own stories. Your purpose and mission need to fuel you from the inside before you can sustainably bring others along.

## When to Use It

- When you notice recurring frustrations or conflicts in your leadership
- When feedback from your team doesn't match your self-perception
- When you feel stuck despite working harder
- When you're stepping into a new leadership role and old patterns aren't working
- When you want to have greater influence but external storytelling techniques aren't landing
