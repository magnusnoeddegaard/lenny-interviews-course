# Pyramid of Leadership Self-Awareness

> "At first we know nothing about ourself and then the next level is that we start to become self-aware, but believe the whole world is wired just like we're wired. And then you go up to the next level and you believe that the world thinks different things, but you still think your way is the best way." - John Cutler

## What It Is

The Pyramid of Leadership Self-Awareness describes five developmental levels that leaders progress through as they mature. Each level represents an expansion of perspective - from complete ignorance about oneself to the ability to leverage diverse viewpoints as an organizational asset.

Understanding where you (and others) sit on this pyramid helps explain many leadership conflicts. When a leader at Level 2 manages someone at Level 4, friction is inevitable. When two Level 2 leaders clash, neither can understand why the other doesn't see the obvious truth.

## How It Works

**Level 1: Unconscious Ignorance**
- No self-awareness about one's own beliefs, biases, or operating style
- Acts on instinct without reflection
- "This is just how things work"

**Level 2: Self-Aware, But Assumes Universality**
- Begins to understand own beliefs and preferences
- Assumes everyone else thinks the same way
- "I believe X, therefore everyone believes X"
- Example: "People only stay for their manager and money. Everyone knows that."

**Level 3: Recognizes Differences, But Believes Own Way is Best**
- Acknowledges others have different perspectives
- Still convinced their own approach is superior
- "Yes, others think differently, but they're wrong"
- Can be dismissive of alternative viewpoints

**Level 4: Appreciates Multiple Valid Approaches**
- Recognizes that different perspectives can be equally valid
- Understands context determines which approach works best
- "Their way works for them, my way works for me"
- Beginning of true flexibility

**Level 5: Leverages Diversity as Asset**
- Sees diverse perspectives as a source of competitive advantage
- Actively seeks out different viewpoints to make better decisions
- Doesn't dishonor own perspective but integrates it with others
- "Bringing these perspectives together creates something none of us could alone"

## How to Apply It

1. **Self-diagnose honestly** - Where do you sit? Most people overestimate their level. Look for evidence:
   - Do you genuinely seek out contrary opinions?
   - When you disagree, do you try to understand the other's context?
   - Do you believe there are "right" ways to work that apply universally?

2. **Recognize others' levels** - This helps predict and prevent conflicts:
   - Level 2 leaders will be confused when their "obvious" truths aren't shared
   - Level 3 leaders will engage in debates to prove they're right
   - Level 4+ leaders can hold space for disagreement

3. **Create conditions for growth** - People advance by:
   - Working with diverse teams
   - Experiencing contexts where their usual approach fails
   - Being coached by leaders at higher levels
   - Having their assumptions safely challenged

4. **Don't skip levels** - You can't jump from Level 2 to Level 5. Each level builds on the previous understanding.

5. **Level 5 doesn't mean no opinions** - The goal isn't wishy-washy neutrality. Level 5 leaders have strong views but hold them loosely and actively integrate other perspectives.

## When to Use It

- When experiencing repeated conflicts with certain people
- When diagnosing why communication isn't landing
- When coaching leaders on self-awareness
- When building leadership development programs
- When evaluating your own growth as a leader
