# Controlled Chaos

> "There's a certain amount of creativity that chaos breeds and you have to know how to build controlled chaos in some ways. So you have to create a foundation that isn't liable to rupture... as long as those things are bedded down and you allow your engineers to have the freedom to experiment and iterate and do the things that energizes them, that's the ideal." - Dhanji R. Prasanna

## What It Is

Controlled Chaos is a leadership philosophy that embraces productive disorder while maintaining essential safeguards. Rather than imposing strict processes that stifle creativity, leaders establish a foundation of critical protections—against liability, security, and financial risk—and then give teams freedom to operate chaotically within those boundaries.

Dhanji developed this approach leading Cash App engineering from 10 to 200+ engineers and 20 million users. From the outside, the team looked chaotic—people built random experiments, shipped them without strict policies, and ignored traditional software lifecycle rules. But underneath was a solid foundation that prevented true catastrophe.

## How It Works

**The Foundation (Must be bedded down):**
- Systems that prevent major liability exposure
- Financial safeguards that prevent losing money
- Security controls that protect user data
- Core infrastructure that can't be accidentally broken

**The Chaos (Allow to flourish):**
- Engineers building experiments without permission
- Random ideas getting shipped quickly
- People working on things they're energized about
- Conventional software processes being ignored
- Creative exploration in unexpected directions

**The Balance:**

Too much control kills creativity and produces mediocre, process-driven outputs. Too much chaos leads to catastrophic failures, security breaches, and lost money. The art is finding where the line sits.

"If they want to spin their wheels building something that is a complete waste of time for a little bit—but at the same time, if they're delivering these amazing things on the flip side—then I'll almost allow that. I'll be okay with that."

**Why it works:**

1. **Engineers do more harm than good when harnessed** - Trying to direct brilliant engineers into strict areas limits their potential
2. **Creativity requires freedom** - Breakthrough products emerge from exploration, not from following processes
3. **Energy matters** - People do their best work on things that energize them
4. **The foundation catches failures** - When experiments fail, safeguards prevent catastrophe

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify what absolutely cannot fail:**
   - What liability exposure could threaten the company?
   - What financial systems could lose money if broken?
   - What security failures would be catastrophic?
   - What user data must be protected?

2. **Build robust safeguards for those areas:**
   - Don't rely on process compliance
   - Build technical safeguards that make failure difficult
   - Test these safeguards regularly

3. **Release everything else:**
   - Stop trying to control what projects people work on
   - Allow experiments to be shipped without extensive review
   - Let teams build things that might be "a complete waste of time"
   - Trust that smart people will self-correct

4. **Watch for rabbit holes but don't panic:**
   - "Engineers can really go off into rabbit holes if you let them"
   - This is acceptable if the foundation holds
   - Some waste is the price of creativity

5. **Measure outcomes, not process compliance:**
   - Are you shipping valuable things?
   - Are customers being served?
   - Is the foundation holding?

## When to Use It

- When leading highly capable, self-motivated teams
- When innovation and creativity are essential to success
- When you've noticed process is slowing down value creation
- When top talent is leaving because they feel constrained
- At startups and growth-stage companies where speed matters

## When NOT to Use It

- When the team lacks senior judgment
- When catastrophic failure would be company-ending
- When regulatory requirements mandate specific processes
- When the foundation isn't yet strong enough
