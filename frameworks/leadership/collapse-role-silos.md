# Collapse Role Silos

> "I just think that that concept of collapsing roles, everybody needs to become more full stack to do the... being more outcome-oriented, right? Your outcome as an AE is to convince customers of the value of your product and close deals, right? Okay, well, in order to do that, you used to have dependencies on having assets created by marketing and an SE to help you demo. Can you collapse more of those dependencies so that if you had to, you could do it all yourself?" - Howie Liu

## What It Is

Collapse Role Silos is an organizational philosophy that pushes individuals to become capable of executing full outcomes without depending on specialists in other roles. In the AI era, when tools make it possible for anyone to create marketing assets, build prototypes, or demo products, the friction of handoffs between specialists becomes the bottleneck.

This applies across functions: PMs who can prototype, marketers who can run their own performance campaigns, AEs who can do their own demos, engineers who can think about product.

## How It Works

**Traditional Siloed Model:**

Example: Launching a marketing campaign
1. PMM writes positioning guide
2. Content team creates copy
3. Design creates assets
4. Performance marketing sets up targeting
5. Multiple handoffs, reviews, delays

**Collapsed Model:**

One marketer who can:
- Understand the positioning
- Write the copy (or prompt AI to help)
- Create basic assets
- Set up the campaign in AdWords
- Analyze and iterate

**Why This Works Now:**

AI tools have lowered the skill barrier for many tasks:
- Anyone can create decent visuals with AI
- Anyone can draft copy with AI assistance
- Anyone can build simple prototypes
- Anyone can do basic data analysis

The human's job becomes orchestration and judgment, not execution of specialized tasks.

**Key Principle: Outcome Orientation**

Instead of asking "what's my role?" ask "what outcome am I responsible for, and what would I need to be able to do to achieve it without waiting on others?"

## How to Apply It

Steps for collapsing silos in your organization:

1. **Map dependencies** - For each role, list all the other roles they depend on to complete their work
2. **Identify collapsible skills** - Which of those dependencies could be self-served with AI tools and some upskilling?
3. **Enable self-service** - Provide tools, templates, and training for people to do adjacent tasks themselves
4. **Restructure around outcomes** - Define success by outcomes achieved, not tasks completed in your specialty
5. **Celebrate full-stack wins** - Recognize people who shipped something end-to-end without handoffs

## When to Use It

This model is valuable when:

- Speed matters more than polish
- You're in a rapidly evolving market
- Handoff friction is slowing you down
- AI tools have made adjacent skills accessible
- You want startup-like agility at scale

Be careful when:
- Quality in a specific domain is critical and can't be compromised
- Regulatory or compliance requirements demand specialist sign-off
- The specialized skill truly requires years of training AI can't shortcut
