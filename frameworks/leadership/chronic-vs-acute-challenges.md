# Chronic vs Acute Challenges

> "Not all companies are equally dysfunctional. And no, not all high performing companies are equally beautiful in all roses. Legitimately some companies work down the chronic issues, which allows them to face the acute stressors, and other companies are just mired in acute issues." - John Cutler

## What It Is

The Chronic vs Acute Challenges framework borrows from medical terminology to help leaders distinguish between two fundamentally different types of organizational problems:

**Chronic challenges** are deep-rooted, systemic issues that have built up over time - technical debt, cultural dysfunction, structural misalignment, poor hiring patterns. They don't cause immediate crises but steadily erode organizational capability.

**Acute challenges** are sudden, immediate stressors that demand urgent response - market shifts, economic downturns, competitor moves, pandemic disruptions, key employee departures.

The critical insight: Organizations that address their chronic issues are far better equipped to handle acute stressors when they arise. Those that neglect chronic problems become overwhelmed by acute challenges because they lack the organizational resilience to respond.

## How It Works

**Chronic Issues (Examples):**
- Accumulated technical debt
- Misalignment between strategy and structure
- Cultural problems (trust issues, siloing)
- Poor feedback loops
- Hiring patterns that don't match needs
- Process bloat or missing processes

**Acute Issues (Examples):**
- Economic downturn
- Pandemic disruption
- Key competitor move
- Leadership departure
- Major customer loss
- Security breach

**The Interaction:**
- Healthy organizations: Chronic issues addressed → can absorb acute shocks
- Struggling organizations: Chronic issues ignored → acute problems become existential

## How to Apply It

1. **Diagnose which type you're facing** - Before jumping to solutions, classify the problem:
   - Has this been building for a long time? (Chronic)
   - Is this a sudden external shock? (Acute)
   - Is this an acute problem revealing chronic weakness?

2. **Prioritize chronic issue reduction during calm periods** - When things are stable, invest in:
   - Paying down technical debt
   - Improving team processes
   - Building cultural resilience
   - Strengthening feedback loops

3. **Don't confuse symptoms with causes** - Acute crises often reveal chronic weaknesses. The pandemic didn't create remote work problems; it exposed companies that hadn't invested in communication infrastructure.

4. **Build organizational resilience** - Companies that work on chronic issues develop "antibodies" that help them respond to acute challenges faster.

5. **Be intentional about crisis response** - Cutler observed that companies that intentionally designed their pandemic response (vs. just waiting for it to end) emerged much stronger.

## When to Use It

- During organizational planning and prioritization
- When facing a crisis (is this acute, chronic, or both?)
- When evaluating company health
- When deciding whether to join a company
- When explaining why "obvious" problems persist
