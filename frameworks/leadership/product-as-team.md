# Product as Team

> "I as the CEO, as notionally the head of product, I view our product as our team... It is the genesis of this company. It is not a new web browser. It is, let's build the dream team, our dream team. And let's build a way of working that is really fun for us and really speaks to our values." - Josh Miller

## What It Is

Product as Team is a company-building philosophy that treats the team itself as the primary product, with the software or service you sell as a natural byproduct of assembling the right people and creating the right environment.

For The Browser Company, this is literal: the founding idea wasn't "let's build a better browser." It was "let's build a company where we can hire our favorite people and work in the way that resonates with us—on a problem ambitious enough to attract those people." The browser category was chosen because it provided the right canvas for this team-building objective.

This inverts the typical startup narrative. Most founders identify a product opportunity and then build a team to execute it. Product as Team says: identify the team you want to build, then find a problem worthy of that team.

## How It Works

The philosophy manifests in several ways:

1. **Genesis is team, not product**: The company started with "who do we want to work with and how?" not "what product should we build?"

2. **Team news is product news**: When someone joins, it's treated as a product launch worthy of public celebration

3. **Hiring is the main work**: The CEO's job is primarily about attracting and enabling great people, not directing product decisions

4. **Process follows people**: Ways of working are designed around what the team needs, not industry standards

5. **Vision serves team-building**: The product vision is ambitious partly because that's what attracts exceptional people

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with the team you want**: Before finalizing your product idea, ask: "What kind of people do I want to spend the next decade with? What problem would attract them?"

2. **Make hiring your highest-leverage activity**: As CEO/founder, treat recruiting as your primary job, not a support function

3. **Celebrate team additions**: Announce hires publicly, write about them as individuals, treat joining as an achievement

4. **Remove yourself from product details**: If the team is the product, your job is to enable them, not direct every decision

5. **Design culture intentionally**: Your ways of working are as important as what you're working on

6. **Let product vision follow team**: Ask "what could this group of people uniquely build?" not just "what does the market need?"

## When to Use It

- When founding a company and haven't fully committed to a product direction
- When you have extraordinary people-attraction ability
- When you believe the right team will find the right product
- When you've had previous success and can attract talent based on reputation
- When building in a space where craft and quality differentiate (consumer products, creative tools)

## Limitations

This approach has prerequisites:
- You need to be able to attract great people (track record, network, compelling story)
- The product opportunity needs to be genuinely ambitious to justify this approach
- It may be less applicable for highly technical or domain-specific products where the problem must come first
