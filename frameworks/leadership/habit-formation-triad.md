# Habit Formation Triad

> "When I think about trying to change behavior on your team, a lot of people think about it more of an education model—you teach the thing, you assess the thing, and then there's some accountability around the thing. I think if you think about it more in the context of behavioral psychology, it actually works a lot better." - Hilary Gridley

## What It Is

When leaders want to drive new behaviors on their teams—whether it's AI adoption, new processes, or skill development—they typically default to an education model: teach, assess, enforce accountability.

Hilary Gridley argues this misses the point. Behavioral change is fundamentally about habit formation, not education. The Habit Formation Triad identifies three essential elements:

1. **Consistency** - Daily practice, starting impossibly small
2. **Low Friction** - Remove barriers, especially emotional and contextual ones
3. **Powerful Reward Loops** - Immediate, emotional, satisfying feedback

## How It Works

### 1. Consistency

Habits form through daily repetition, not occasional intense practice. The key is making the initial ask so small it's almost impossible to skip.

**For AI adoption example:**
- NOT: "Use AI to write your next PRD"
- YES: "Spend 2 minutes with ChatGPT every day for 30 days doing one tiny task"

Hilary's "30 Days of GPT" program gives people one small task per day. Each task takes no more than a minute or two. After 30 days, the behavior has become habitual.

### 2. Low Friction

The biggest mistake leaders make is introducing new behaviors in high-stakes work contexts. When you're on deadline and under pressure, the last thing you want is friction from unfamiliar tools.

**Reduce friction by:**
- Start with fun, low-stakes applications (vacation planning, personal tasks)
- Remove the need to figure out what to use the tool for
- Eliminate the frustration of learning through failed work attempts
- Make the first experience pleasurable, not painful

**Example:** Instead of having people use AI for actual work projects (high stakes, pressure to succeed), start with using it to plan vacation destinations or generate talking points from your calendar.

### 3. Powerful Reward Loops

This is the element leaders most neglect. For behavior change to stick, rewards must be:
- **Powerful** - Strong enough to override the comfort of old habits
- **Immediate** - Experienced right after the behavior, not days later
- **Emotional** - Creating genuine positive feelings, not just intellectual satisfaction

**Example from WHOOP:**

The recovery score (red/yellow/green each morning) creates a powerful anti-reward loop for alcohol:
- Immediate: You see the impact the next morning
- Emotional: That red score "just feels bad"
- Powerful: Strong enough to change behavior that years of knowing "alcohol is bad for you" didn't change

> "There's something about seeing that red score that just feels like... it has this really profound emotional impact on people."

## How to Apply It

**For AI adoption on your team:**

1. **Create a 30-day program** with one tiny daily task
2. **Start with fun, not work** - Personal use cases remove pressure
3. **Celebrate publicly** - Shout-outs in team meetings for creative uses
4. **Let them demo** - "Make them feel like a million bucks for doing the thing"

**For any behavior change:**

1. **Ask yourself:**
   - How am I creating consistency? (Daily, not weekly or monthly)
   - Where is the friction? (Context, skills, emotional barriers)
   - What's the immediate reward? (Not metrics weeks later—instant gratification)

2. **Design the reward loop first** - Work backward from "how will they feel great?"

3. **Remove work pressure** - Practice in low-stakes contexts before applying to real work

**Reward loops for teams:**

When someone demonstrates a desired behavior:
- Give them a shout-out in the team meeting
- Let them demo to others
- Make them "feel like a million bucks"

> "People see that, and people respond to it. Be very thoughtful about which behaviors you're rewarding. If you're rewarding staying up until 2am to get things done, that's the behavior people will mimic."

## When to Use It

- Driving AI tool adoption
- Introducing new processes or tools
- Building team skills
- Any situation where you want lasting behavior change, not just one-time compliance

## The Anti-Pattern: Education Model

The traditional approach:
1. Train people on the new thing
2. Assess whether they learned it
3. Create accountability for using it

Why it fails:
- Knowledge doesn't equal behavior
- Accountability creates resentment
- No emotional investment in the change

The habit model:
1. Make it easy to start (low friction)
2. Make it rewarding immediately (reward loop)
3. Make it daily (consistency)
4. Behavior becomes automatic over time
