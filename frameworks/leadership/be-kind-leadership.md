# Be Kind (Leadership)

> "Anytime an employee fails, it's your fault. Be kind. You hired them. They never knew what they were getting themselves into." - Jason Lemkin

## What It Is

Be Kind is a leadership principle that reframes employee failure as leadership responsibility. When someone doesn't work out, the fault lies with the leader who hired them—not the employee who accepted the role. This perspective transforms how you handle departures, difficult conversations, and the entire employment relationship.

It's not about being soft. Great leaders make tough decisions. But they do so with kindness, recognizing their own accountability.

## Why This Matters

**The Traditional Framing:**
- Employee failed to meet expectations
- Employee wasn't committed enough
- Employee didn't have the skills
- Employee's fault

**The Be Kind Framing:**
- I failed to identify the mismatch during hiring
- I failed to set realistic expectations
- I failed to assess skills properly
- My fault—be kind

## How It Works

**The Core Insight:**

Candidates can never do enough diligence. There isn't time. They're joining based on hope, excitement, and limited information. They trusted you when you painted the picture of the role.

If the reality doesn't match:
- The job was too hard
- There wasn't enough budget
- The team was dysfunctional
- The hours were impossible
- The skills required were different

...that's on you. You knew (or should have known) what you were hiring for.

## How to Apply It

### When Things Aren't Working

1. **Start with yourself** - "How did I contribute to this situation?"
2. **Be honest about the setup** - Did you set them up for success?
3. **Take responsibility** - Even if they made mistakes, you chose them
4. **Help them land well** - References, introductions, time to find next role

### When Letting Someone Go

5. **Make it respectful** - Not a quick email or spreadsheet
6. **Give real feedback** - What would help them in the next role?
7. **Support the transition** - Severance, references, networking help
8. **Maintain relationship** - They might be right for a different role later

### In Difficult Moments

9. **Pause before anger** - "I'm frustrated, but is this fair?"
10. **Check your expectations** - Were they realistic?
11. **Consider their experience** - What did they go through?
12. **Choose kindness anyway** - Even when it's hard

## The Jason Example

Jason Lemkin recalls a customer who switched to DocuSign after he'd "killed himself" to close the deal. The champion changed, the new person brought a competitor:

> "Man, I was just so mad. I just tore into this guy... But I broke the relationship forever."

Looking back, even when someone makes a choice that hurts you, kindness serves better than anger.

## What This Isn't

Be Kind doesn't mean:
- Avoiding hard decisions
- Tolerating poor performance indefinitely
- Pretending problems don't exist
- Being a pushover

It means:
- Taking responsibility for your role in the situation
- Treating people with dignity during difficult moments
- Recognizing your own part in hiring mistakes
- Being the kind of leader people respect even when they leave

## The Universal Pattern

> "You've interviewed so many people, Lenny, right? I've talked to almost all the top CEOs in SaaS. And they're kind. It doesn't mean that they're soft, they're not soft. They make tough decisions every day, but they're kind."

The best leaders combine:
- Tough standards
- Hard decisions
- Kind treatment
- Personal accountability

## The Ripple Effect

When you're kind to people who don't work out:
- They speak well of you
- They might return when circumstances change
- Others see how you treat people
- Your culture reflects it
- You can look at yourself in the mirror

When you're harsh:
- Burned bridges everywhere
- Reputation damage
- Team sees how you treat people
- Culture becomes fear-based
- Regret accumulates

## Making It Personal

Jason Lemkin puts "Be Kind" in his Twitter bio as a reminder:

> "It's a reminder. It's a reminder."

Not because he's naturally kind all the time—but because he knows he needs to be reminded.
