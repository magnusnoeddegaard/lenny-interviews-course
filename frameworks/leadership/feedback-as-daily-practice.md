# Feedback as Daily Practice

> "Feedback really, in my mind, ideally, should be a daily practice. Because the thing that matters for us in the long run as a team is how quickly are we getting better? A team that just gets 1% better every week compared to a team that gets 1% better a month... is going to outperform in a very short amount of time." - Julie Zhuo

## What It Is

A philosophy that treats feedback not as a periodic performance review activity but as a continuous, daily habit. The compounding effect of frequent small improvements dramatically outpaces occasional large feedback sessions.

The framework addresses a common organizational dysfunction: companies have semi-annual performance cycles, so people think feedback happens twice a year. But waiting months to give feedback means:
- Problems compound without correction
- Good behaviors aren't reinforced
- Improvement happens slowly
- Issues become harder to address

Feedback is fundamentally about testing hypotheses against reality. We all have biased perceptions of ourselves (Dunning-Kruger effect, imposter syndrome). Feedback from others is the mechanism for calibrating our self-perception to reality.

## How It Works

**The feedback gift:**
- Others can see things about you that you can't see (like a leaf in your hair)
- Feedback reflects back information you couldn't access alone
- It's a gift because it enables calibration and growth

**Three tactics for effective feedback:**

1. **Establish opt-in relationships early**
   - Before problems arise, agree that you'll give each other feedback
   - "I want you to tell me everything. Do you want me to tell you everything?"
   - This pre-commitment makes later feedback 60% easier

2. **Check your intention before delivering**
   - Ask: "Am I giving this to help them grow, or to be right/punish/validate myself?"
   - If your intention isn't pure, wait until you're calm
   - Good intention gets you to 80% success

3. **Say the hard part out loud**
   - If you're nervous, say "I'm nervous about telling you this..."
   - Vulnerability is humanizing and builds connection
   - Being direct about difficulty actually makes it easier

## How to Apply It

1. **Set up feedback relationships proactively** - With every new colleague, establish early that you want open, continuous feedback in both directions.

2. **Ask for feedback preferences** - "Do you prefer feedback in the moment or accumulated over time?" Most people say in the moment, which gives you permission.

3. **Make feedback daily** - Don't wait for review cycles. Notice something? Share it today. Small feedback frequently beats large feedback rarely.

4. **Check your motivation** - Before giving critical feedback, ensure you're coming from a place of wanting to help, not wanting to win or punish.

5. **Be vulnerable** - If giving feedback feels hard, acknowledge that difficulty out loud. "This is hard for me to say because I value our relationship..."

## When to Use It

- When starting any new working relationship
- When you notice something worth mentioning (good or bad)
- When building team culture
- When coaching others on how to give feedback
- When feeling reluctant to share observations
