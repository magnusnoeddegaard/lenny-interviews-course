# Slime Mold Strategy

> "Slime molds, I think, is acknowledging that organizations are, especially ones that focus on autonomy and agency of their individual employees, they are more like slime molds than we realize. And if you fight that fact, you're going to have a bad time. And if you embrace it, then you can start realizing slime molds are actually kind of amazing. They can find solutions to problems you didn't even know you were searching for." - Alex Komoroske

## What It Is

Slime Mold Strategy is a framework for understanding and working with organizational dynamics, especially in tech companies that value individual autonomy. The core insight is that organizations—even with excellent, collaborative, hardworking people—face an emergent coordination challenge that grows with the square of the number of people involved.

Rather than fighting this reality or pretending it doesn't exist, leaders can embrace it and design for emergence. Slime molds, despite having no central brain, can solve complex optimization problems. Similarly, organizations that accept their nature as emergent swarms can be remarkably effective and anti-fragile.

## How It Works

**The Core Problem:**
Coordination cost grows with the square of the number of people working on something. This isn't about bad actors or poor communication—it's mathematically inevitable. Finding the subset of projects that everyone agrees on, commits to, and actually works on together becomes exponentially harder as you scale.

**The Vehicle Metaphor:**
- **Small company (sports car)**: Founder can steer directly. Everyone knows who's driving and accepts it. Rapid pivots are possible.
- **Large company (big rig)**: If you drive a big rig like a sports car, you'll hurt yourself and others. You must drive the vehicle you actually have.
- **Driving a big rig well**: Pivot less, be more intentional, invest in program management, give more slack in planning.

**Two Organizational Approaches:**

**1. Coherent Vehicle (Apple model)**
- Maintain illusion of perfect product coherence
- Requires heavy coordination investment
- High cost, but products feel unified
- "These teams clearly talked to each other"

**2. Swarm of Sports Cars (AWS model)**
- Accept that teams won't coordinate on everything
- Products may feel disjointed
- Anti-fragile and fast-moving
- "Yeah, there are 15 different ways to do everything"

Both can work—you must choose which tradeoffs you accept.

## How to Apply It

1. **Acknowledge reality**
   - Your organization is more like a slime mold than you want to admit
   - Fighting this wastes energy and creates frustration
   - Accepting it opens up new options

2. **Choose your model explicitly**
   - Coherent vehicle: invest heavily in coordination
   - Swarm of sports cars: accept inconsistencies
   - Don't pretend you can have both without cost

3. **Drive the vehicle you have**
   - If you're a big rig, don't try sports car maneuvers
   - If you're a swarm, don't expect synchronized turns
   - Match your tactics to your organizational reality

4. **Leverage emergence**
   - Slime molds find solutions to problems you didn't know existed
   - Let the swarm discover things top-down planning can't
   - Create conditions for good emergent behavior

5. **Protect autonomy where it matters**
   - Autonomy creates the positive emergent behaviors
   - But autonomy + scale = coordination challenge
   - Be intentional about where you need coordination vs autonomy

## When to Use It

**This framework is especially useful when:**
- You're scaling a company and things feel harder
- Coordination is taking more time than execution
- Teams are duplicating work or working against each other
- Top-down mandates aren't sticking
- You're frustrated that "smart people won't just align"

**Key insight:**
The dysfunction isn't because people are bad—it's emergent from scale and autonomy. Once you see this, you stop blaming individuals and start designing systems.
