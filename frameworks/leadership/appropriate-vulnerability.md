# Appropriate Vulnerability

> "I actually think that a leader who is willing to be appropriately vulnerable is a stronger leader." - Carole Robin

## What It Is

Appropriate Vulnerability is a framework for understanding when and how leaders should be vulnerable. It challenges the traditional mental model that leaders must appear invulnerable, while also warning against the trap of inappropriate over-sharing.

The key insight is that vulnerability itself isn't good or bad—context determines appropriateness. The same disclosure that builds trust in one situation can destroy credibility in another. Leaders need to develop judgment about when vulnerability serves their people and when it undermines them.

Carole Robin argues that appropriate vulnerability is actually a form of strength, not weakness. Leaders who never show vulnerability become seen as inauthentic, robotic, or unrelateable. Followers ask themselves "Why should I follow this person?" and "When I grow up, do I want to be like them?" A leader who appears to have no fears, struggles, or uncertainties isn't inspiring—they're unbelievable.

## How It Works

**Inappropriate Vulnerability (Too Much):**

"Third month in a row we've lost share. I have no idea what's happening or why or what to do about it. I'm feeling pretty crappy about myself. I'm not even sure I should be your VP of Marketing."

This undermines confidence, provides no direction, and makes the leader's insecurity the team's problem.

**Inappropriate Invulnerability (Too Little):**

Standing up and pretending nothing is happening when everyone knows there's a problem. This destroys credibility and signals the leader is either oblivious or dishonest.

**Appropriate Vulnerability (Just Right):**

"Probably no secret to most of you that's the third month in a row we've lost share. I wish I could stand up here and tell you I know exactly what's happening and exactly what we should do about it, but I don't. And I have never needed you all more."

This acknowledges reality, admits uncertainty honestly, and mobilizes the team rather than paralyzing them.

**What Makes Vulnerability Appropriate:**

1. **It's in service of others**, not just self-expression
2. **It maintains enough confidence** that people know you can still lead
3. **It invites contribution** rather than creating paralysis
4. **It's calibrated to context** (audience, stakes, setting)
5. **It includes a forward path**, not just a confession of problems

## How to Apply It

**Before Disclosing, Ask:**

1. **Who is this for?** Is sharing this serving my team, or am I just venting?
2. **What outcome do I want?** Will this mobilize people or demoralize them?
3. **What's the context?** Is this the right audience, setting, and moment?
4. **How much is appropriate?** Can I share the relevant parts without oversharing?
5. **What's the forward path?** Can I connect this vulnerability to action?

**Situations Where Vulnerability Helps:**

- When everyone already knows there's a problem
- When you need to mobilize collective effort
- When you want to model that it's safe to admit uncertainty
- When you want to build deeper trust with your team
- When admitting a mistake will increase rather than decrease respect

**Situations Requiring Caution:**

- When the audience can't handle uncertainty (e.g., customers, investors in certain contexts)
- When you're processing emotions and haven't yet reached clarity
- When the vulnerability is about personal issues unrelated to work
- When sharing would burden others with problems they can't help solve

## When to Use It

- Before all-hands meetings where you need to address difficulties
- When deciding what to share with your team about challenges
- When considering whether to admit a mistake publicly
- When mentoring leaders on executive presence
- When building trust with new teams
