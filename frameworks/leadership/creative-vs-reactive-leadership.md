# Creative vs Reactive Leadership

> "Are you responding to the world from a place of fear, where you see problems and threats, you want to be right, you want to be liked, you're defensive as an inward approach, or are you responding to the world from a place of openness, possibility, curiosity, passion, growth, purpose?" - Ken Norton

## What It Is

Creative vs Reactive Leadership is a fundamental distinction in how leaders engage with the world. It comes from the work of Bob Anderson and Bill Adams at the Leadership Circle, though similar concepts appear across leadership literature (Conscious Leadership Group calls it "above the line vs below the line," Brene Brown calls it "daring vs armored leadership").

**Reactive leadership** operates from fear and anxiety. Leaders see problems and threats, want to be right, want to be liked, and respond defensively. It's externally referenced—success is defined by meeting others' expectations rather than internal purpose.

**Creative leadership** operates from openness, possibility, curiosity, passion, and purpose. Leaders tap into their authentic vision and use it to navigate the world rather than letting the world set their expectations.

Research by Anderson and Adams shows that creative leadership is positively correlated with success across every dimension—leadership capability, revenue, brand strength, profitability—while reactive leadership is negatively correlated. Yet 75% of leaders primarily operate reactively because shifting to creative leadership requires deep inner work.

## How It Works

The distinction isn't about skills or tactics—it's about the internal operating system from which you lead:

**Reactive indicators:**
- Operating from fear and anxiety
- Seeing problems and threats everywhere
- Needing to be right or liked
- Comparing yourself to others
- Letting external definitions drive your goals ("I want to be VP because that's what I'm supposed to do")
- Feeling like you're playing a game where everyone else sets the rules

**Creative indicators:**
- Operating from purpose and vision
- Seeing possibilities and opportunities
- Being decisive without needing approval
- Defining success internally
- Leading from authentic values
- Feeling like you're designing the game, not just playing it

The shift requires confronting underlying beliefs and assumptions. For example, Ken Norton believed he couldn't be a leader because he wasn't "tough enough"—his only archetype for leadership was the autocratic, controlling type. The creative shift came from redefining what leadership meant for him authentically.

## How to Apply It

1. **Notice when you're reactive** - Pay attention to fear and anxiety as signals. When you're seeing problems everywhere, wanting to be right, or needing approval, you're likely in reactive mode.

2. **Identify your reactive posture** - Most people default to one of three postures (see Three Reactive Postures framework). Understanding yours helps you recognize your patterns.

3. **Challenge underlying beliefs** - Ask what assumptions you're making. "I can't be a leader because I'm not commanding enough" contains beliefs about what leadership must look like that may not be true.

4. **Redefine success internally** - Instead of "I want to be VP," ask "What do I actually want? What matters to me?" Let your authentic purpose guide your goals.

5. **Shift from "liked" to "admired over time"** - Ken Norton's unlock was redefining his need to be liked: "Rather than I want to leave this room with everyone liking me, I started to realize I want to be the type of leader where, a decade later, people say, 'I would work with that guy again in a heartbeat.'"

6. **Get feedback** - 360-degree assessments can help you see where you're operating creatively vs reactively. The dopamine hit of seeing creative approaches work reinforces the shift.

## When to Use It

Use this framework when:

- You feel stuck despite having all the skills and knowledge
- You're experiencing burnout or questioning if you love your work anymore
- You're at a career milestone that requires a mindset shift, not just new skills
- You notice you're constantly reacting to others rather than leading with vision
- Your goals feel externally imposed rather than internally meaningful
- What got you here isn't getting you there
