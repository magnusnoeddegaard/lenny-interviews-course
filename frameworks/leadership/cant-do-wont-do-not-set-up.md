# Can't Do, Won't Do, Not Set Up

> "There are only three reasons why things do not happen the way you want them to happen as a leader." - Anuj Rathi

## What It Is

This is a diagnostic framework for leaders facing execution problems. When results aren't materializing, the natural instinct is to blame individuals. But this framework forces a more systematic analysis by identifying which of three root causes is actually at play—and each requires a fundamentally different intervention.

The framework's key insight: 70-80% of execution problems are "not set up" issues, meaning they're actually leadership/system failures, not individual failures.

## How It Works

### The Three Causes

**1. Can't Do (Capability)**
The person lacks the skills, knowledge, or ability to execute. This is a true capability gap.

*Diagnostic questions:*
- Does this person have the required skills?
- Have they demonstrated this capability before?
- If we explained exactly what to do, could they do it?

*Interventions:*
- Coaching and mentoring
- Training and skill development
- Moving to a role that fits their capabilities
- In some cases, parting ways

**2. Won't Do (Motivation/Alignment)**
The person has the capability but isn't executing. Something is blocking their motivation or creating misalignment.

*Diagnostic questions:*
- Do they agree with the vision?
- Are they aligned on priorities?
- Do they have competing demands on their time?
- Is there a trust or relationship issue?

*Interventions:*
- Understand the source of misalignment
- Address competing priorities
- Rebuild trust or alignment
- Sometimes accept that values misalignment can't be resolved

**3. Not Set Up (System)**
The person has capability and motivation, but the organizational design, processes, or resources prevent success.

*Diagnostic questions:*
- Are OKRs clear and non-conflicting?
- Is the org design enabling or blocking this work?
- Are there resource constraints?
- Are ways of working properly designed?
- Does Conway's Law explain the problem?

*Interventions:*
- Redesign org structure
- Clarify or simplify OKRs
- Remove process bottlenecks
- Provide necessary resources
- Fix systemic blockers

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with "Not Set Up" as your hypothesis**
   - Most problems (70-80%) are system failures
   - Leaders often default to blaming individuals
   - Challenge yourself: "What system did I fail to design?"

2. **Use the framework in performance conversations**
   - "Help me understand—is this a capability gap, a motivation issue, or are you not set up for success?"
   - Creates a more productive conversation than accusation

3. **Look for patterns**
   - If multiple people "can't do" the same thing, you might have a hiring or training system problem
   - If multiple people "won't do" something, you might have an alignment or incentive problem
   - Patterns reveal system issues

4. **Apply Conway's Law**
   - Look at your product: can you see the org chart in it?
   - "Show me an engineering architecture, and I will tell you what the org design of this company is"
   - Products often fail because org design is wrong, not because people are wrong

5. **Design systems for success**
   - Team Topologies concept: org design shapes what products can be built
   - OKRs that conflict across teams create "won't do" situations
   - Unclear ownership creates "not set up" situations

## When to Use It

- Performance reviews and feedback conversations
- Diagnosing why initiatives are failing
- Before making hiring/firing decisions
- Organizational design discussions
- Post-mortems on failed projects
- When you're frustrated with execution
