# Managing Complex Change

> "I found this framework... it travels from computer to computer with me and team to team. It's got these five components: vision, skills, incentives, resources, action plan—and you need all of those to have change." - Bangaly Kaba

## What It Is

Managing Complex Change is a diagnostic framework for understanding why organizational change efforts fail or teams struggle. It identifies five essential components required for successful change, and shows that missing any single component produces a predictable type of dysfunction.

The framework originated in organizational change literature (possibly business school, per Bangaly) and has proven valuable across multiple companies for diagnosing and fixing team-level problems.

## How It Works

### The Five Components

For successful change, a team needs all five:

1. **Vision** - Clear picture of where the team is going
2. **Skills** - Capabilities to execute the work
3. **Incentives** - Motivation aligned with desired outcomes
4. **Resources** - People, budget, and tools to get work done
5. **Action Plan** - Clear steps and processes for execution

### What Happens When One Is Missing

| Missing Element | Result |
|----------------|--------|
| Vision | **Confusion** - Team works hard but lacks direction |
| Skills | **Anxiety** - Team knows what to do but feels incapable |
| Incentives | **Resistance** - Team capable but not motivated to do the work |
| Resources | **Frustration** - Team wants to execute but lacks means |
| Action Plan | **False Starts** - Team has capability and motivation but can't operationalize |

### Diagnosing Team Problems

When you observe a team symptom, trace it back to the missing component:

- **Team seems confused about priorities?** → Check Vision
- **Team feels overwhelmed or incapable?** → Check Skills
- **Team pushes back or drags feet?** → Check Incentives
- **Team complains about being under-resourced?** → Check Resources
- **Team starts and stops repeatedly?** → Check Action Plan

## How to Apply It

1. **Observe First**: When joining a team or inheriting a problem, spend time watching how the team operates. Listen to conversations, attend meetings, understand the dynamics.

2. **Identify the Symptom**: What's the dominant feeling? Confusion? Anxiety? Frustration? Resistance? False starts?

3. **Trace to the Component**: Use the mapping above to identify which component is likely missing.

4. **Start Right-to-Left**: Action plans are easier to implement than vision changes. If multiple components are weak, start with action plans and work backward:
   - **Action Plan**: Institute better PRD frameworks, meeting structures, communication patterns
   - **Resources**: Reallocate or advocate for more resources
   - **Incentives**: Align goals, recognition, and rewards
   - **Skills**: Build training materials, shared mental models, frameworks deck
   - **Vision**: Articulate where the team is going and why

5. **Build a Skills Repository**: Create a deck of skills and frameworks that you bring to each new team. When teams lack shared mental models (skills gap), this deck creates common language quickly.

6. **Address Vision Last**: Vision changes take time and require buy-in. Focus on enabling the team through the other components while building toward vision alignment.

## When to Use It

- When taking over a new team or joining a new company
- When a team is underperforming despite talented people
- When change initiatives keep failing
- When diagnosing why a team feels "stuck"
- When preparing to implement organizational change

## Real Example: YouTube Product Craft

When Bangaly joined YouTube, his teams didn't have a shared mental model for "product craft"—a concept that was foundational at Instagram.

**Symptom observed**: Anxiety. Teams knew what they should be building but felt unsure about how to execute at the quality level expected.

**Component identified**: Skills gap. The team lacked shared frameworks for thinking about product quality.

**Solution**: Built a deck explaining product craft—what it means, how to think about it, specific frameworks. This created shared language and reduced anxiety by giving teams tools to evaluate their own work.
