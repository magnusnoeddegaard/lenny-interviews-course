# Reboot Equation

> "I wrote practical skills, plus radical self-inquiry, plus shared experiences equals enhanced leadership plus greater resilience. And I said that enhanced resilience—that is the purpose of this whole thing." - Jerry Colonna

## What It Is

The Reboot Equation is Jerry Colonna's foundational formula for developing leaders who can succeed without destroying themselves in the process. It emerged spontaneously during a talk at Naropa University when Jerry was trying to explain what he does as an executive coach.

Most leadership development focuses solely on practical skills—the "how" of doing the job. But Jerry discovered that sustainable leadership requires two additional ingredients: radical self-inquiry (examining your inner life) and shared experiences (talking openly about challenges with others).

The equation's output isn't just "better leadership"—it's enhanced resilience. As Jerry emphasizes: "I get you want to be a great CEO, I get you want to be a great executive, but what I really care about is you not killing yourself in the process."

## How It Works

**The Three Inputs:**

1. **Practical Skills**
   - What people typically come to coaches for
   - The "how" of doing the job
   - Management techniques, communication skills, strategic thinking

2. **Radical Self-Inquiry**
   - Questions that cut through self-delusion
   - Examining relationship to money, self-worth, success
   - Understanding family of origin patterns
   - Questions like "Why did you choose this job in the first place?"

3. **Shared Experiences**
   - Talking honestly about challenges with trusted others
   - Breaking the culture of "everything's fine, we're crushing it"
   - Creating spaces where truth can be told without fixing or judgment

**The Two Outputs:**

1. **Enhanced Leadership**
   - Better decision-making from greater self-awareness
   - Improved team dynamics from leaders who've done their own work
   - More authentic presence and connection

2. **Greater Resilience**
   - The capacity to face challenges without breaking
   - Freedom from the need for external validation
   - Sustainable success that doesn't destroy you

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your current development** - Are you only focused on skills? Most leaders neglect self-inquiry and shared experiences entirely.

2. **Add radical self-inquiry** - Start journaling with powerful questions:
   - How have I been complicit in creating conditions I say I don't want?
   - What am I not saying that I need to say?
   - Why do I believe success will make me feel safe?
   - What would happen if I failed?

3. **Create spaces for shared experience** - Find or create:
   - A peer group of leaders you can be honest with
   - A coach or therapist for deeper work
   - Any circle where the pretense of "crushing it" isn't required

4. **Connect skills to self-awareness** - When learning practical skills, examine your resistance:
   - Why is delegation hard for you specifically?
   - What does your relationship with feedback reveal about your past?
   - Where do your management blind spots come from?

## When to Use It

- When designing leadership development programs
- When evaluating your own growth as a leader
- When you've achieved outward success but feel miserable
- When skills alone aren't solving leadership challenges
- When onboarding executives who need to develop resilience
