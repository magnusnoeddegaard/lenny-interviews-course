# Victim to Creator

> "The most empowering and radical transformation that I've been able to cultivate and develop is shifting from that to a state of I am willing to take responsibility for how I see the world." - JM Nickels

## What It Is

Victim to Creator is a fundamental mindset shift from experiencing life as something that happens to you (victim consciousness) toward experiencing life as something you co-create (creator consciousness).

This doesn't deny that real injustices exist or that some people face genuine victimization. But it recognizes that most professionals spend too much time feeling at the effect of circumstances—other people's behavior, company politics, market conditions, external events—rather than taking responsibility for their experience and response.

JM Nickels cites Viktor Frankl's "Man's Search for Meaning" as the ultimate example: even in a Nazi concentration camp, Frankl demonstrated that you can choose your response to any circumstance. If he could find meaning and compassion in those conditions, we can do the same in a product review.

## How It Works

**Victim Consciousness:**
- "I'm at the effect of other people and what they do"
- "I'm at the effect of circumstances like COVID or the economy"
- "Life is happening to me"
- Waiting for external conditions to change
- Blaming others for problems

**Creator Consciousness:**
- "I take responsibility for how I see the world"
- "I can change how I'm being in relationship to circumstances"
- "Life is happening through me"
- Choosing my response to any situation
- Asking "how am I co-creating this?"

**The Radical Question:**
Even in situations where you play a small part, ask: "How am I perpetuating this?" This isn't about self-blame—it's about finding your leverage point for change.

## How to Apply It

1. **Catch the victim language** - Notice when you say "they made me feel" or "I have to" or "I can't because." These signal victim consciousness.

2. **Ask the reframe question** - Instead of "why is this happening to me?" ask "how am I co-creating this?" or "what's my part in this?"

3. **Focus on your response** - You may not control circumstances, but you always control your response to them.

4. **Use the Frankl test** - "If Viktor Frankl could find meaning in a concentration camp, can I show up differently in this meeting?"

5. **Choose your experience** - Decide how you want to relate to whatever is happening, rather than letting it determine your state.

## When to Use It

- When you notice blame language in your thinking
- When feeling powerless about organizational dynamics
- When external events (economy, politics) feel overwhelming
- When other people's behavior is affecting your state
- When you feel stuck and waiting for something to change
- During coaching conversations with team members who feel victimized
