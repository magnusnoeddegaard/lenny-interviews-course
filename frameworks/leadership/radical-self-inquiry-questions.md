# Radical Self-Inquiry Questions

> "You know you're in the radical self-inquiry zone when the questions take your breath away." - Jerry Colonna

## What It Is

Radical Self-Inquiry Questions are carefully crafted prompts designed to cut through self-delusion and reveal what's really driving our behavior. Part of what makes them "radical" is that we're socialized NOT to ask these kinds of questions—they feel dangerous because they might lead to uncomfortable realizations.

The key principle: questions that startle you, that cause you to be a little afraid of the answer—that's where the gold is. If a question doesn't make you pause, it's probably not radical enough.

These questions don't require you to share answers with anyone but yourself. The most important person to be honest with is you.

## How It Works

Radical self-inquiry operates on the premise that self-delusion and attachment are the biggest contributors to our suffering. By asking piercing questions, we can:

1. **Surface hidden truths** we've been avoiding
2. **Identify patterns** from our past that drive current behavior
3. **Reveal misalignments** between what we say we want and what we actually pursue
4. **Create agency** by making the unconscious conscious

## The Core Questions

**The Complicity Question:**
- How have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want?

**The Communication Questions:**
- What am I not saying that I need to say?
- What am I saying that's not being heard?
- What's being said that I'm not hearing?

**Identity Questions:**
- Who would I be without the story of who I am?
- What is it that you wish that people in your life knew about you, but you're too afraid to tell them?

**Success and Worth Questions:**
- What will achieving this goal do for me?
- How do I define success? Where does that definition come from?
- Is my sense of self-worth attached to this outcome?

**Legacy Questions:**
- At the end of my days, what would I like the people who come after me to say about me?
- What kind of ancestor do I want to be to my descendants?

**Relationship Questions:**
- What draws me to positions/relationships like this one?
- How have I benefited from the dysfunction that exists here?

## How to Apply It

1. **Create the right container**
   - Set aside dedicated time (journaling, meditation, quiet reflection)
   - Remove distractions
   - Approach with openness, not judgment

2. **Choose questions that resonate**
   - Start with whichever question creates the most internal resistance
   - If a question feels "too scary," that's often the right one

3. **Go deep, not wide**
   - Better to sit with one question thoroughly than rush through many
   - Let answers unfold over days or weeks
   - Return to the same question periodically

4. **Don't fix, just notice**
   - The goal is awareness, not immediate action
   - Understanding often precedes change naturally
   - Resist the urge to solve or bypass

5. **Consider sharing (selectively)**
   - While you don't have to share, talking with trusted others amplifies insight
   - A coach, therapist, or peer group can help you see blind spots

## When to Use It

- During regular journaling practice
- When stuck in recurring patterns you can't break
- Before making major life or career decisions
- When success feels hollow or anxiety-producing
- In leadership development and executive coaching
- When teams are dysfunctional and you're looking outward for blame
