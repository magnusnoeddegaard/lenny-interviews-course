# Just Don't Die

> "One of my mantras is just don't die. Just keep your startup going. Just keep going. And I say that over and over again and honestly, that is often what people tell me is the most impactful thing I said." - Dalton Caldwell

## What It Is

"Just Don't Die" is the fundamental philosophy that the primary job of a startup founder is to keep the company alive. Based on patterns from over 1,000 YC startups, the companies that succeed share one common trait: the founders refused to give up when rational analysis suggested they should.

This isn't about ignoring reality—it's about understanding that every successful startup went through moments where giving up seemed like the logical choice. The difference between failed startups and unicorns often isn't the quality of the idea; it's whether the founders persisted through the near-death experiences that every startup faces.

Like elite athletes who need coaches reminding them of fundamentals, even the best founders need constant reinforcement of this simple truth.

## How It Works

**The Pattern Across Successful Startups**

Looking at companies like Airbnb, Brex, Retool, and thousands of others:
- At some point, the founders "should have" rationally given up
- The idea objectively wasn't working
- They were disappointing stakeholders and themselves
- Continuing was an "irrational" act

Yet they persisted, and eventually succeeded.

**Why Founders Give Up**

The most common cause of startup death isn't running out of money—it's losing hope:
- Founders still have some runway left
- But they've had fights with co-founders
- They can't agree on what to do next
- They just don't want to continue anymore

Death by demoralization is far more common than death by bankruptcy.

**The 100% Near-Death Experience Rate**

Every founder of a successful company went through a moment where they seriously wondered if it was all over. For the most successful companies, this happened multiple times. The difference is they didn't accept defeat.

## How to Apply It

**Keep checking for signs of life:**

1. **Are you still having fun?** Do you enjoy the work and working with your co-founders?
2. **Do you love your customers?** Do you know them by name? Do you care about their problems?
3. **Do you have more ideas?** Are there growth tactics or pivots you haven't tried?
4. **Is there internal gravitational force?** Do you deeply believe you can make this work?

**When to persist:**
- You still enjoy the work and the people
- You love your customers and your problem space
- You have untried ideas for growth
- Deep down, you believe you're "the one"

**When it might be okay to stop:**
- The work makes you genuinely miserable
- Your relationships are suffering
- You've completely run out of ideas
- You no longer want to work with your co-founder

## The Coaching Analogy

When elite NBA coaches are mic'd up during huddles, they're not sharing complex strategic insights. They're saying things like "Focus. Get the ball. Win this game." The greatest athletes still need reminders of fundamentals.

Founders are the same. Knowing you should persist is different from actually persisting. Sometimes you need someone to repeatedly tell you: just don't die.

## When to Use It

- When everything feels hopeless
- When you're questioning whether to continue
- When the startup is struggling but not dead
- When you need perspective on whether to pivot vs. shut down
- As a constant mantra during the startup journey
