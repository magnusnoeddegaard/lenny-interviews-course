# Product Shapes Culture

> "I have this theory that the type of product you're building very much influences the way that you think... At Spotify they do an incredible amount of talking about problems... I imagined that was because Spotify is a very auditory product. Everyone there thinks about music, sound, podcasts, that is their mindset." - Cameron Adams

## What It Is

Product Shapes Culture is the insight that the nature of your product fundamentally influences your organizational thinking patterns, communication styles, and decision-making processes. At Canva, this manifests as a deeply visual culture—everything is about seeing ideas, creating mock-ups, and presenting visions visually. At Spotify, it manifests as a more auditory/verbal culture where problems are hashed out through conversation.

This isn't just a quirky observation; it has practical implications for hiring, onboarding, and how new leaders succeed or fail within an organization.

## How It Works

**The Core Theory:**
- Companies naturally develop thinking styles that match their product domain
- Auditory products (music, podcasts) → verbal/discussion-based cultures
- Visual products (design tools) → visual/prototype-based cultures
- This affects meeting styles, decision-making, and communication norms

**At Canva (Visual Product):**
- Visions must be seen, not just described
- Ideas require mock-ups and prototypes
- You need to "get that idea out of your head and present it in a visual form"
- Non-visual thinkers struggle to communicate effectively

**At Spotify (Auditory Product):**
- Extensive talking and discussion about problems
- Ideas hashed out through conversation
- The mindset is built around music, sound, and podcasts

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your product's nature** - Is it visual, auditory, tactile, data-driven, narrative-based?

2. **Examine your culture** - How do decisions actually get made? Through conversation, documents, prototypes, data?

3. **Align communication expectations:**
   - If visual: expect and require mock-ups, prototypes, visual presentations
   - If auditory: optimize for discussions, verbal debates, storytelling
   - If data: center decisions around metrics and dashboards

4. **Hire for cultural fit** - Look for candidates who naturally think in your product's domain

5. **Onboard intentionally** - Help new hires understand and adapt to your communication style

6. **Give new leaders time** - Advise them to "listen for a couple of months" before trying to change processes

## When to Use It

Apply this framework when:

- **Diagnosing cultural misfit** - A new hire or leader isn't landing despite strong credentials
- **Onboarding new employees** - Help them understand the "hidden" communication expectations
- **Building processes** - Design workflows that match your natural thinking style
- **Hiring executives** - Look beyond functional expertise to cultural thinking alignment
- **Integrating acquisitions** - Recognize that different product types create different cultures

## Example: Why Leaders Fail at Canva

Cam explains why some external hires don't succeed at Canva:

> "One of the things that's very particular about Canva is really setting visions. And I'm in visions, not just in the sense of looking forward two, three years, but also visions in the very visual sense. We need to be able to see it."

Leaders who fail are often those who:
- Aren't naturally visual thinkers
- Try to communicate ideas through words alone
- Don't create mock-ups or prototypes
- Come in with preconceived processes from non-visual companies

The advice: "Just listen for a couple of months, figure out what is really working at Canva and why it works before you try and change it."
