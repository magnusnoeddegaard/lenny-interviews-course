# Excellence Through Responsiveness

> "Especially as I've gotten more senior in roles, there can be an expectation that it's okay for other people to wait on me... and I really try to avoid that." - Elizabeth Stone

## What It Is

Excellence Through Responsiveness is the practice of demonstrating dedication and high standards through how quickly and reliably you respond to others—especially as you become more senior. It's the recognition that making people wait on you, even when you could "get away with it," signals a lack of respect for their time and undermines your effectiveness as a leader.

The core insight is that excellence isn't about heroic individual efforts or working extreme hours. It's about consistent, reliable follow-through that makes you someone others can depend on. When you respond quickly, show up on time, and deliver what you promised when you promised it, you create the conditions for others to succeed.

Elizabeth Stone emphasizes that this isn't about time spent—it's about care. The motivation is that "other people are relying on me and I want to show up for them."

## How It Works

The framework manifests in specific behaviors:

1. **Rapid response to requests** - When someone sends you something, respond as quickly as you can, even if just to acknowledge receipt
2. **Following through on commitments** - If you say you'll do something by a certain time, do it
3. **Punctuality** - Being on time to meetings, especially when you're the senior person
4. **Not blocking others** - Never let your review, approval, or input become the bottleneck

The underlying principle: seniority doesn't earn you the right to make others wait. If anything, it increases your responsibility to be responsive because more people depend on you.

## How to Apply It

1. **Treat responsiveness as a leadership signal** - Your response time tells people how much you value them. Fast response = high respect.

2. **Don't let seniority slow you down** - Resist the temptation to become less responsive as your role grows. The more senior you are, the more your delays cascade.

3. **Acknowledge even when you can't complete** - If you can't fully respond immediately, at least acknowledge receipt and set expectations for when you will.

4. **Follow through on the timeline you committed to** - If you said "I'll review this by Friday," review it by Friday. If you can't, communicate proactively.

5. **Be on time** - Treat punctuality as a form of respect. Your time isn't more valuable than theirs just because of your title.

## When to Use It

- As a daily practice in all work communication
- When managing expectations with direct reports
- When you notice yourself becoming a bottleneck
- When you find yourself rationalizing delays because "I'm busy"
- As a model for the culture you want to build
