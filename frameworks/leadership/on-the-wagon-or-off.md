# On the Wagon or Off

> "You've got to identify whether someone's on the wagon or off the wagon and either quickly convince them to get on the wagon or if they're not on the wagon, they shouldn't be there." - Kayvon Beykpour

## What It Is

On the Wagon or Off is a binary framework for evaluating leadership alignment during periods of cultural change. It forces a clear decision: is this person actively rowing in the direction of the new vision, or are they resisting it? There's no room for passive passengers.

The framework acknowledges a hard truth: during organizational transformation, you can't afford extended periods of convincing skeptical leaders. Either they genuinely buy into the new direction quickly, or they need to exit. Ambiguity and prolonged fence-sitting slows everything down and allows resistance to calcify.

Kayvon admits that Twitter was "terrible at this" and didn't have the "organizational structure nor the fortitude" to act decisively on these determinations—and the result was cultural change that was slower and less efficient than it should have been.

## How It Works

**The Two States**:
- **On the wagon**: Actively contributing to the new vision. Excited, aligned, rowing in the same direction.
- **Off the wagon**: Resistant, skeptical, or passively going through the motions. May be undermining the vision directly or indirectly.

**Why Binary Matters**:
In a functional organization with competing visions, leaders who are "sort of aligned" or "willing to try" often become bottlenecks. They slow consensus, add friction to decisions, and signal to their teams that the new direction may not stick.

**The Speed Imperative**:
High performers who ARE aligned won't wait around forever. "If you're extremely talented and you're dealing with organizational shit, you're going to go find someplace else that lets you do your craft and have impact."

**The Elon Contrast**:
Kayvon notes that Elon Musk operates on the opposite extreme—"his tolerance for people who are not aligned and his tolerance for low performance is famously extremely low." While this has its own costs, it demonstrates the power of decisive action on alignment.

## How to Apply It

1. **Tell the story clearly** - You can't evaluate alignment until everyone hears the same vision. Repeat the vision constantly and consistently.

2. **Watch for behavioral signals** - On-the-wagon people volunteer for the hard work, defend the vision in meetings, and find ways to advance it. Off-the-wagon people focus on why it won't work, drag their feet, and protect the status quo.

3. **Create early tests** - Launch a small initiative aligned with the new vision. Who steps up? Who finds reasons to opt out?

4. **Confront the ambiguous quickly** - Don't let people stay in "maybe" for long. Have direct conversations: "I need to understand where you stand."

5. **Move people off the wagon decisively** - If someone isn't aligned after clear vision-sharing and a genuine opportunity to engage, act. The cost of keeping misaligned leaders far exceeds the cost of transition.

6. **Protect the aligned** - Make it visible that being on-the-wagon is rewarded. This attracts more aligned talent and signals that the transformation is real.

## When to Use It

- During organizational transformation or cultural change
- When implementing a new strategy that challenges existing assumptions
- When joining an organization as a change agent
- When a new leader takes over a team or organization
- After acquiring a company and integrating the team

## Cautions

This framework requires:
- **Clear vision first**: You can't evaluate alignment if people don't know what they're aligning to
- **Genuine opportunity**: Give people a real chance to get on board before judging
- **Organizational support**: Acting on these determinations requires authority and backing
- **Self-awareness**: Make sure you're evaluating alignment to vision, not personal loyalty
