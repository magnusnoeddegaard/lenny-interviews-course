# Bring the Donuts

> "I think it was really to be a metaphor around being a servant leader, bringing whatever needs to be done, filling the white space, filling the gaps, whatever needed to happen." - Ken Norton

## What It Is

"Bring the Donuts" is Ken Norton's famous metaphor for servant leadership in product management. It originated from his influential 2005 essay on hiring product managers and became a defining characteristic of effective PMs.

The concept captures the essence of product management: you lead without formal authority, so you must earn influence through contribution. You bring value by filling gaps, handling what needs to be handled, and making the team more effective—symbolized by literally bringing donuts to a meeting.

It's not about the donuts themselves—it's about the mindset of asking "What does this team need?" and being willing to do that thing, even if it's not glamorous or explicitly in your job description.

## How It Works

Product managers don't have direct authority over engineers, designers, or other team members. You can't order people around—you have to lead through service and earned respect:

**The servant leader mindset:**
- Fill the white space between roles
- Do whatever needs to be done
- Make everyone else's job easier
- Remove obstacles and friction
- Take on unglamorous work without complaint

**Why it works:**
- Builds trust and goodwill with the team
- Demonstrates that you're in it together
- Creates an environment where others want to collaborate
- Earns influence through contribution, not title

**Digital equivalents (for remote work):**
- Send DoorDash codes for local donut shops to team members
- Handle administrative tasks that slow others down
- Be the one who schedules meetings, takes notes, follows up
- Proactively solve problems before they become blockers

## How to Apply It

1. **Ask what the team needs** - Before each meeting or sprint, consider what gaps exist and what would make things easier for everyone.

2. **Do the unglamorous work** - Write the meeting notes, schedule the follow-ups, maintain the documentation, organize the backlog—without being asked.

3. **Fill the white space** - When something falls between roles and no one owns it, pick it up.

4. **Make others successful** - Your job is to help engineering ship, design shine, and the whole team win—not to be the hero yourself.

5. **Earn influence through contribution** - Authority comes from consistently adding value, not from your title.

## When to Use It

Use this mindset:

- Always, as a product manager—it's core to the role
- When joining a new team and building trust
- When working with skeptical engineers or stakeholders
- When you want to create a collaborative team culture
- When you're leading without formal authority
