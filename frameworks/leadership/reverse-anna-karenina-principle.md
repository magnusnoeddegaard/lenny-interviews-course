# Reverse Anna Karenina Principle

> "The dysfunctional families are all different and the happy families are the same... It's the reverse of that with product teams. Actually the dysfunctional companies are all the same and then the happy companies or the higher performing companies can be very, very different." - John Cutler

## What It Is

The Reverse Anna Karenina Principle, attributed to Josh Arnold and popularized by John Cutler, inverts Tolstoy's famous observation about families. In the original, Tolstoy wrote that "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."

For product teams, it's the opposite: dysfunctional teams exhibit remarkably similar anti-patterns that are easy to identify, while high-performing teams achieve success through vastly different approaches, cultures, and methods.

This has profound implications for product advice and management. It means you can reliably identify what's going wrong (anti-patterns are predictable), but you cannot simply copy what successful companies do and expect the same results.

## How It Works

**Dysfunctional teams share common anti-patterns:**
- High work-in-progress with no prioritization
- Strategy-structure mismatches
- Leadership saying one thing and doing another
- Lack of decision-making clarity
- No feedback loops on outcomes

**High-performing teams vary dramatically in:**
- Decision-making processes (rigorous vs. ad-hoc vs. top-down)
- Leadership styles (servant leaders vs. dominant visionaries)
- Team structures (collectivist vs. individualistic)
- Communication patterns (hierarchical vs. flat)
- Planning approaches (heavy process vs. flexible iteration)

## How to Apply It

1. **Diagnose dysfunction reliably** - When things aren't working, look for the common anti-patterns. They're predictable and fixable.

2. **Don't copy success blindly** - Just because a company like Figma or Stripe does something doesn't mean it will work for you. Their success comes from a unique combination of factors.

3. **Find your own path** - Instead of adopting frameworks wholesale, understand the principles behind successful approaches and adapt them to your context.

4. **Build coherence** - High-performing teams may look different, but they share coherence between their strategy, structure, culture, and actions.

5. **Challenge "best practices"** - Be skeptical of universal advice. What works is deeply contextual.

## When to Use It

- When evaluating product advice and deciding what to adopt
- When diagnosing team dysfunction (look for common patterns)
- When benchmarking against other companies
- When building your team's operating model
- When hiring consultants or coaches
