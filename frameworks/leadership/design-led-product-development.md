# Design-Led Product Development

> "There's a CEO and the CEO was very product-led, his designer himself, but he surrounded himself with the design team. That was sort of the central team in the company. And the design team was like 10, 12 people. Basically, pretty small, even at 5, 6,000 employees." - Gaurav Misra

## What It Is

An organizational model where design—not product management—is the central function connecting the CEO to all product decisions. Designers act as both designers AND product managers, handling roadmaps, specs, stakeholder coordination, and execution alongside their core design work.

This model emerged from Snap under Evan Spiegel and enabled an unusual level of founder control at scale. With only 10-12 designers managing all user-facing changes at 5,000+ employees, every UI addition required passing through a small group with direct CEO access.

## How It Works

**The structural innovation:**
- CEO meets directly with 10-12 designers regularly
- These designers are ICs with no reports
- All user-facing changes require designer approval (and thus CEO visibility)
- No new UI can ship without going through this bottleneck
- Engineering and infrastructure work continues independently

**The hybrid designer-PM role:**
> "These weren't your sort of average designers. These were designers who were actually PMs as well. That's what the secret sauce was. They were able to not just design but also do the PM part."

Designer-PMs must handle:
- Roadmap development
- Spec writing and documentation
- Cross-team coordination
- Shipping schedules
- User research and product needs
- The design work itself

**Why it enables founder control:**
> "He could meet with a set of 10 or 12 people and know every change that was happening that was user impacting... Everything needed to be approved by Evan. If you hadn't approved it, it's not going out."

## How to Apply It

1. **Find the rare designer-PM hybrids** - These people are uncommon. They need leadership skills, documentation abilities, stakeholder management, and design craft. They must be able to run the entire product process solo

2. **Keep the team extremely small** - The bottleneck is the point. If you grow this team, you lose founder visibility and control

3. **No reports allowed** - Designer-PMs must remain individual contributors to maintain hands-on craft

4. **Separate infrastructure from UI** - Engineering work that doesn't touch user interface can proceed independently without designer involvement

5. **Compensate accordingly** - "They were paid way higher than you would expect designers or PMs or engineers to be paid with quarterly bonuses and all kinds of things"

## When to Use It

This model works particularly well for:
- Consumer products where user experience is the primary differentiator
- Founders with deep product and design intuition (like Evan Spiegel)
- Companies where consistency and taste are paramount
- Organizations where the CEO wants to stay involved in product details at scale

It's challenging when:
- You can't find designer-PM hybrids (they're rare)
- The product is primarily backend or API-driven
- The founder doesn't have strong design intuition
- Scaling requires faster decentralized decision-making

**Important caveat from Gaurav:**
> "Not hiring PMs at Snap might've been one of those decisions where it actually succeeded despite that and because someone needs to do that work. If you don't have enough people to do it, then nobody truly owns it and then it doesn't really happen."
