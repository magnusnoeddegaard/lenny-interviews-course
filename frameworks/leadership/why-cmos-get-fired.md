# Why CMOs Get Fired

> "The issues are generally one, that the CMO isn't focused enough on the revenue... The CEO doesn't feel like they really have a partner in driving the revenue. Or they don't feel like the CMO really has a handle on what will drive the revenue." - Carilu Dietrich

## What It Is

A diagnostic framework for understanding why Chief Marketing Officers (and by extension, other C-suite executives like CPOs) fail to build trust with CEOs and ultimately lose their jobs.

Carilu observes that both CMOs and CPOs face similar challenges: they're responsible for strategy roles with "difficult to measure results because some of them are direct and some of them are indirect." This ambiguity creates a trust gap that executives must actively bridge.

## How It Works

### The Core Problem: Trust Gap

CEOs often don't know if they can trust their CMO's judgment because:
- Marketing spend has delayed, sometimes multi-quarter returns
- Awareness campaigns take years to show impact
- Attribution is ambiguous—what actually drove that deal?
- The CMO's domain expertise makes it hard for CEOs to evaluate their decisions

This is especially acute at early-stage companies where the CEO is often a first-time founder who "hasn't run marketing before, doesn't know if they should trust what the marketer's saying."

### Why CMOs Fail

**1. Losing Connection to Revenue**
- Getting too focused on pipeline or awareness (leading indicators)
- Not being seen as a partner in driving the actual revenue number
- Failing to have "a handle on what will drive the revenue"

**2. Not Speaking the CEO's Language**
- Marketing has its own vocabulary that doesn't translate to boardroom metrics
- Unable to make solid predictions about growth levers
- Can't connect marketing activities to financial outcomes the board cares about

**3. Missing the Strategic Dimension**
- Only working the operational "levers in the factory"
- Not thinking ahead: "What new markets should we enter? What new growth areas should we employ? What new companies should we acquire?"
- Failing to earn a seat at the strategy table

### What Success Looks Like

CMOs who survive and thrive:
- Have a handle on the metrics
- Make solid predictions about what growth levers they can use
- Talk in the terms of the CEO and the board
- Run their business well operationally
- Are good leaders that people want to work for
- Build great teams that elevate them and the company
- Think strategically about market space, not just tactics

## How to Apply It

### For CMOs (or any executive in a "soft" domain):

1. **Anchor everything to revenue** - Even brand work should have a clear theory of how it connects to revenue growth

2. **Learn finance** - Understand how the business model works, what drives unit economics, how the board evaluates success

3. **Build prediction muscles** - Track your forecasts against reality. Get better at calling your shots.

4. **Translate constantly** - Never assume the CEO understands marketing jargon. Connect every initiative to business outcomes.

5. **Get ahead of questions** - If you're always explaining why results aren't what you predicted, trust erodes. Proactively communicate what's working and what isn't.

### For CEOs:

1. **Be explicit about what you need** - If you need your CMO to be more revenue-focused, say so directly

2. **Create forums for trust-building** - Give your CMO visibility into your concerns so they can address them

3. **Consider bringing in advisors** - Third-party validation can help CEOs calibrate whether their CMO is underperforming or facing real business constraints

## Why CPOs Face the Same Problem

Casey Winters notes that "most CPOs also get fired." Carilu's analysis: "They're incredibly hard jobs. The chief product officer and the chief marketing officer are both strategy jobs with difficult to measure results."

Both roles:
- Own outcomes that take time to materialize
- Have indirect causality that's hard to attribute
- Get blamed when the company underperforms
- Require translating domain expertise into CEO/board language
