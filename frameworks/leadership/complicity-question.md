# Complicity Question

> "How have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want? The purpose of this question is actually to evoke your own agency." - Jerry Colonna

## What It Is

The Complicity Question is a powerful self-inquiry tool that helps leaders examine their own role in perpetuating situations they claim to want to change. It's designed to cut through self-delusion and evoke personal agency rather than assign blame.

Jerry Colonna deliberately chose the word "complicit" rather than "responsible" because complicit does not mean responsible—that's a critical distinction. As he explains: "To understand the word complicit, think of the word accomplice. You are driving the getaway car, you're not sticking up the bank teller."

The second half of the question—"I say I don't want"—is equally important. This isn't about blaming yourself for everything bad in your life. It's about examining the ways you may have been deluding yourself about what you actually want versus what you say you want.

## How It Works

The question operates on multiple levels:

1. **Surface level**: It asks you to examine a situation you claim to dislike
2. **Deeper level**: It reveals how your actions (or inactions) may be perpetuating that situation
3. **Deepest level**: It exposes the hidden benefits you may be getting from the status quo

**Example from Jerry Colonna**: "I say I don't want to feel busy all the time, but the truth of the matter is I feel really unnerved and disconcerted if my agenda isn't jam-packed."

This reveals a common pattern: we often complain about conditions that actually serve us in some way—even if that way is unhealthy.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify a recurring complaint** - What do you frequently say you don't want? (Being too busy, having a difficult team member, lacking work-life balance, etc.)

2. **Examine your actions** - How have your choices contributed to this situation? What have you done (or not done) that enables it to continue?

3. **Look for hidden benefits** - How might this unwanted condition actually serve you? Does being busy make you feel important? Does the difficult team member give you someone to blame?

4. **Find a more conscious alternative** - Once you understand why you've been complicit, you can choose a more conscious way to meet that underlying need

5. **Take agency** - The goal is to move from victimhood to ownership—not self-blame, but self-awareness that leads to different choices

## When to Use It

- When you find yourself repeatedly complaining about the same situations
- When you feel stuck in patterns you claim to want to change
- When teams or relationships aren't working and you're focused on what others are doing wrong
- When you're about to blame circumstances for your situation
- During executive coaching or leadership development work
