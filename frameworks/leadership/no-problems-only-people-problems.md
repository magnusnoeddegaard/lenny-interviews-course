# No Problems, Only People Problems

> "My business partner, Chris, has a really great quote. He says, 'There are no problems. There is only people problems.'" - Andrew Wilkinson

## What It Is

This framework reframes business challenges through the lens of people. Every apparent business problem—strategy, execution, product, growth—ultimately traces back to having the right (or wrong) people in place.

The insight shifts focus from solving symptoms to addressing root causes: with great people, almost any problem feels manageable; with difficult people, even simple problems become crises.

## How It Works

**The People Lens:**
- Business failing? → Who's responsible and are they the right person?
- Strategy unclear? → Do you have the right strategic thinkers?
- Execution poor? → Are the operators capable?
- Culture toxic? → Who's creating the toxicity?

**The Emotional Test:**
Andrew describes spending 20% of his time filtering people because:
- Great people around you → Problems feel solvable, life is calm
- Difficult people around you → Everything becomes stressful, "all bets are off"

**Types of People Problems:**
1. **Wrong fit** - Talented person in wrong role
2. **Wrong hire** - Unqualified or incapable person
3. **Bad actor** - Psychopath, narcissist, or toxic personality
4. **Misalignment** - Person wants to do something different than what's needed

## How to Apply It

1. **When facing any business problem, ask:**
   - Who is responsible for this area?
   - Are they the right person for this challenge?
   - If I had the perfect person here, would this still be a problem?

2. **Filter ruthlessly:**
   - Screen carefully before hiring
   - Move quickly when someone isn't working out
   - "If I ever think 'should I fire this person' even once, I should fire them immediately"

3. **Never try to change people:**
   - "You can never mentor someone into being a good employee"
   - Hire for what you need, not potential you hope to develop
   - People show you who they are—believe them

4. **Protect team composition:**
   - One bad actor can destroy team dynamics
   - Prioritize removing toxic people over acquiring new talent
   - Spend significant time (20%) on people filtering

## The CEO Hiring Corollary

For CEO hires specifically, Andrew learned:
- "Hiring CEOs is like they're an elephant and you're the rider. They're going to go wherever it is that they want to go."
- Listen carefully to what candidates say they want to do—they will do exactly that
- Look for someone whose instincts align with what the business needs
- Don't hire hoping to redirect them; hire someone already pointed the right direction
