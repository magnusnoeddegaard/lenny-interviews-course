# Refuse to Rule

> "One of the most powerful things we do is refuse to rule. Someone will bring me a thing. A lot of times we feel obligated to weigh in and help. I'll be like, 'Nope, but look, I think you've got it. I think the challenges you're facing are the right challenges. I think you're approaching it in the right way. Just do your best there.'" - Boz

## What It Is

When someone brings you a decision, the natural instinct is to help by weighing in. But sometimes the most valuable thing a leader can do is refuse to make the decision for them—explicitly confirming that they have the right understanding, are facing the right challenges, and should proceed on their own judgment.

This is the flip side of "leverage your leaders." While people should ask for help when blocked, leaders also need to recognize when the request for help is actually a request for validation, and sometimes the right answer is: "You've got this. Go."

## How It Works

**The Situation**
Someone brings you a decision, problem, or question. They may be:
- Genuinely blocked and needing help
- Seeking validation for a direction they're already confident about
- Wanting you to take responsibility for the outcome
- Building the habit of escalating everything

**The Assessment**
Before answering, ask yourself:
- Do they actually need my input to proceed?
- Are they facing the right challenges? (Or have they misdiagnosed the problem?)
- Is their approach sound? (Even if I might do it differently?)
- Will my involvement add value or just add delay?

**The Response**
If they've got it, say so explicitly:
- "I think you've got it"
- "The challenges you're facing are the right challenges"
- "You're approaching it the right way"
- "Just do your best there"

This isn't dismissive—it's explicit confirmation that gives them confidence to proceed.

## How to Apply It

1. **Recognize the Pattern**
Notice when people bring you decisions that they could make themselves. Look for signals that they're seeking validation rather than blocked.

2. **Affirm Before Declining**
Don't just say "figure it out yourself." Explicitly confirm: "You understand the problem. Your approach is sound. You have my trust."

3. **Be Selective**
This isn't about never helping. It's about recognizing when helping would actually undermine growth or unnecessarily slow things down.

4. **Create a Culture of Ownership**
When you consistently refuse to rule on things people can handle, you train the organization to take ownership and move faster.

5. **Stay Available**
Refusing to rule doesn't mean becoming unavailable. Make it clear that real blockers should still be escalated.

## When to Use It

- When someone asks for approval on a decision they could make themselves
- When you notice people escalating everything rather than owning outcomes
- When your involvement would add delay without adding value
- When you want to develop someone's confidence and judgment
- When you want to increase organizational velocity

## When NOT to Use It

- When someone genuinely needs information or access you have
- When the decision has major strategic implications
- When someone is new and still learning
- When there are cross-organizational dependencies to navigate
