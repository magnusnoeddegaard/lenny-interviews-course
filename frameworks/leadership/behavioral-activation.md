# Behavioral Activation

> "The misconception is I'll feel better and then I'll act. And the thing that therapists try to teach people is I will act and then I will feel better." - Hilary Gridley

## What It Is

Behavioral Activation is a core concept from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that Hilary Gridley applies to leadership and product management. The fundamental insight is that we have the relationship between feeling and action backwards.

When we're in a negative state—stressed, overwhelmed, burned out, or experiencing imposter syndrome—our instinct is to wait until we feel better before taking positive action. We think: "I don't feel like responding to this text, so I'll do it when I feel better. I don't feel like working out, so I'll go when I have more energy."

But that feeling doesn't go away on its own. In fact, inaction makes it worse. The solution is to flip the equation: take a small action first, and the better feeling will follow.

## How It Works

**The Common Misconception:**
```
Feel bad → Wait to feel better → Then act
```

**The Behavioral Activation Insight:**
```
Feel bad → Take small action → Feel better
```

The key is identifying actions that:
1. Are small enough to actually do when you feel terrible
2. Reliably lift your mood
3. Can be done immediately

These actions work by interrupting negative spirals. Depression, burnout, and anxiety often create feedback loops where inaction leads to guilt, which leads to more negative feelings, which leads to more inaction. A single small action can break this cycle.

## How to Apply It

**For yourself:**

1. **Create a behavioral activation list** - Write down 5-10 small actions that reliably improve your mood. Hilary keeps this list on her phone. Examples might include:
   - Going for a 10-minute walk
   - Calling a friend
   - Putting away one piece of laundry
   - Making a cup of tea
   - Doing 5 pushups
   - Sending a thank-you message

2. **Use it when walls close in** - When you feel yourself getting sucked into low mood, negative thinking, or the urge to isolate, immediately pull out your list and do one item

3. **Start impossibly small** - The action can be as small as picking up one piece of laundry. The point is to interrupt the spiral, not to accomplish something major

**For your team:**

1. **Watch for negative spirals** - When team members come to you ruminating about something that happened, they're often stuck in a spiral

2. **Challenge negative thinking** - "Is there evidence for that? Even if there is, it doesn't really matter."

3. **Redirect to action** - "What's one small thing you could do right now about this?"

4. **Help them see the pattern** - "I notice you're spiraling a bit. What usually helps you get out of this headspace?"

**In product leadership:**

Behavioral activation applies to professional contexts too:

- When you're afraid of how a stakeholder perceives you → Send a quick note demonstrating the opposite
- When you're overwhelmed by a project → Complete one tiny task to build momentum
- When you're stuck on a decision → Make any small related decision to get moving

## When to Use It

**Personal signs you need behavioral activation:**
- You're putting off simple tasks until you "feel ready"
- The walls feel like they're closing in
- You're isolating from colleagues or friends
- You're caught in rumination or negative self-talk
- You feel like you have no energy for anything

**Team signs someone needs behavioral activation:**
- They're fixated on something that happened and can't move forward
- They're coming up with rational-sounding excuses to avoid uncomfortable actions
- They seem paralyzed despite knowing what they should do
- They're waiting for perfect conditions before starting

## The Therapeutic Foundation

Hilary learned this concept while building a depression therapeutic at Big Health. Depression is characterized by negative thinking patterns and the belief that you need to wait until you feel better to act. Clinical psychologists use behavioral activation to help patients identify small actions that reliably improve mood.

> "I have exercised the demons from my head, but they are outside and they are doing pushups. The threat of the demons coming back is always there."

The insight is that managing your mental state is an ongoing practice, not a one-time fix. Having a behavioral activation toolkit gives you agency when negative states inevitably return.
