# CEO ChatGPT Predictor

> "I think the number one predictor is, 'Does the CEO use ChatGPT?' If the CEO is in it all the time, being like, 'This is the coolest thing,' everybody else is going to start doing it." - Dan Shipper

## What It Is

The CEO ChatGPT Predictor is a simple diagnostic for whether a company will successfully adopt AI. Based on Dan Shipper's consulting work helping companies become AI-first, the single best leading indicator is whether the CEO personally uses AI tools in their daily work.

When the CEO actively uses ChatGPT (or equivalent tools), they can drive both excitement and realistic expectations. When they don't, they're either negative on AI (killing adoption) or have unrealistic expectations about what it can do (leading to disappointment).

## How It Works

The framework identifies three CEO archetypes and their outcomes:

**1. Active User CEO**
- Uses AI daily for real work
- Sets appropriate expectations based on experience
- Models the behavior they want to see
- Creates momentum through genuine enthusiasm
- Result: Successful adoption

**2. Delegator CEO**
- Says "This is for someone else to figure out"
- Has no intuition for what's possible
- Sets unrealistic expectations
- Can't role model the behavior
- Result: Stalled adoption and disappointment

**3. Skeptic CEO**
- Doesn't believe in AI's value
- Actively or passively discourages use
- Team is afraid to invest time in AI
- Result: No adoption

## How to Apply It

**For CEOs:**

1. **Start using AI daily** - Pick one task you do regularly and start using ChatGPT or Claude for it. Email drafting, meeting prep, strategic thinking—anything.

2. **Be public about it** - Share what you're learning. When Walleye's CEO sent his "AI-first" memo, he wrote: "I wrote this email with ChatGPT, and you should too."

3. **Set the cultural tone** - Create weekly meetings where people share prompts and use cases. Send weekly emails celebrating AI adoption stats and new discoveries.

4. **Develop intuition** - You can only set realistic expectations if you know what the tools can and can't do. That requires hands-on experience.

**For leaders trying to drive adoption without CEO support:**

1. **Find the believers** - About 10% of employees are early adopters. Find them and highlight their work.

2. **Make it visible** - Create forums where success stories get shared and rewarded.

3. **Try to convert the CEO** - Share wins, show ROI, demonstrate the competitive risk of not adopting.

## When to Use It

- When diagnosing why AI adoption is stalling at a company
- When planning AI transformation initiatives (start at the top)
- When evaluating companies as an investor or employee
- When consulting to help companies become AI-first
- When deciding whether your organization is ready for AI investment
