# First 14 Days Test

> "What do you want to do your first two weeks? In B2B, if I don't hear from the VP of sales or the VP of product that I'm going to go meet customers, out, I'm out." - Jason Lemkin

## What It Is

The First 14 Days Test is a "Columbo-style" interview question that reveals a candidate's true priorities: "What do you want to do your first 14 days?" For VP-level roles in B2B, there's only one right answer: meet customers. Any other answer—especially process-focused answers—is a disqualifying signal.

This works for VP of Sales, VP of Product, VP of Customer Success, and arguably any customer-facing leadership role.

## How It Works

**Why This Question Works:**

It's deceptively simple. Candidates don't feel tested. But their answer reveals:
- What they think the job is about
- Where their instincts lead them
- Whether they're burnt out and process-focused
- If they still care about customers

**The Right Answer (Sales or Product):**
- "Leave me alone. I'm going to talk to 20 customers."
- "I want to join 5 calls on my first day."
- "I need to understand our customers before I can be useful."

**The Wrong Answers:**
- "Get Salesforce set up properly"
- "Work on territory planning"
- "Build out the enablement process"
- "Review the PRDs and roadmap"
- "Set up 1:1s with the team"

## Why "Process First" Fails

Process answers sound responsible. But they reveal that someone:

1. **Doesn't want to work** - Process is comfortable; customers are hard
2. **Is burnt out** - The last few years have exhausted many leaders
3. **Wants to manage, not do** - They've forgotten what the job actually is
4. **Will never learn the product** - If they don't start with customers, they never will

> "When you hear process, process, process, from any—marketing, product, sales, customer success—it's just... the truth is they don't want to work."

## How to Apply It

### Asking the Question

1. **Keep it casual** - "What do you want to do your first couple weeks?"
2. **Don't telegraph** - Let them answer naturally
3. **Listen for customers** - The word should come up immediately
4. **Probe if vague** - "What would day one look like?"

### Evaluating Answers

5. **Strong signals** - "Meet customers," "join calls," "talk to users"
6. **Weak signals** - "Learn the org," "meet the team," "understand the process"
7. **Disqualifying** - "Set up systems," "work on process," "territory planning"

### The VP of Product Version

Great VPs of Product say:
> "Leave me alone. I'm going to go talk to 20 customers. Leave me alone."

They don't want to sit in meetings. They don't want to review PRDs. They want to understand customer problems directly.

## The Post-2020 Problem

Jason Lemkin estimates the majority of VP candidates he interviews are burnt out:

> "I would say I've probably interviewed for different reasons 50 VPs of sales in the last 12 months. I would say the majority don't want to do sales."

The First 14 Days Test quickly identifies who still has energy versus who is looking for a comfortable role.

## The Pleasanton Story

One VP of Sales candidate with an impressive LinkedIn said he was willing to visit customers—but not "as far as the peninsula in San Francisco" from his East Bay home:

> "He's just happy at home. He's happy at home, Lenny, and he don't want to sell."

Best resume and references. Failed the 14-day test completely.

## Beyond the Interview

You can use this retrospectively:
- What did your last VP actually do in their first 14 days?
- Did they meet customers or set up process?
- The pattern predicts future behavior

## Works for Other Roles

The test adapts to other functions:
- **VP Engineering**: "Understand the codebase" > "Reorganize the team"
- **VP Marketing**: "Talk to customers and sales" > "Audit the tech stack"
- **VP Customer Success**: "Meet 20 accounts" > "Set up QBR templates"

The principle is universal: leaders should start with the work, not the process.
