# Take a Punch (Counter-Program the Narrative)

> "If they come to me and they're upset, I try to focus them less around how you litigate another person's impression of you and more on what is the action that you can take to counter program the narrative that you are afraid that this other person has of you. What are you going to do next to demonstrate that you are the person that you know yourself to be?" - Hilary Gridley

## What It Is

"Taking a punch" describes the moments when something goes wrong at work—you misstep in a meeting, hear someone speaking critically about you, or make an error that affects your reputation. It's a physical feeling when your ego gets injured.

Most people's instinct is to litigate what happened, defend themselves, or try to correct the record. But this usually makes things worse—you come across as defensive, you draw more attention to the mistake, and you obsess over things you can't control (what others think of you).

The "Take a Punch" framework redirects this energy toward action. Instead of fighting about the narrative, you counter-program it by taking a small, immediate action that demonstrates the opposite of what you fear they think about you.

## How It Works

When you feel you've "taken a punch," follow these steps:

1. **Acknowledge the feeling** - Recognize you're experiencing ego injury and let yourself feel it briefly

2. **Identify the fear** - Ask yourself: "What am I afraid this person thinks of me?"
   - "They think I don't take this seriously"
   - "They think I'm incompetent"
   - "They think I don't embrace new ideas"

3. **Skip the litigation** - Resist the urge to explain yourself, defend your actions, or correct the record directly

4. **Find a counter-programming action** - Ask: "What is one small thing I can do that demonstrates the opposite of what I fear they think?"

5. **Execute immediately** - Take that action within minutes or hours, not days

## How to Apply It

**Example from Hilary Gridley:**

When WHOOP's CTO suggested tracking ketamine use in the app, Hilary laughed—thinking it was a joke. The CTO responded seriously: "This isn't funny. This is a serious issue for a lot of people."

Hilary was humiliated. She cared deeply about addiction and considered herself someone who embraces new ideas. Her instinct was to follow up and explain herself.

Instead, she asked: "What am I afraid she thinks of me?"
- That I don't take health issues seriously
- That I laugh off emerging trends

Her counter-programming action: She quickly researched emerging public health concerns and found research on sports betting addiction. Within 10 minutes, she sent a note saying: "I really liked that idea. Here's another emerging trend—sports betting and stress correlations—that could be interesting to track."

**The action was small but powerful because:**
- It demonstrated genuine interest in emerging health concerns
- It showed proactive thinking, not defensive explaining
- It moved the relationship forward, not backward

**As a manager teaching this to your team:**

When someone comes to you upset about how they were perceived:

1. Ask: "What's going on in your head? What are you afraid of?"
2. Challenge negative assumptions: "Is there evidence for that? It doesn't really matter either way."
3. Redirect to action: "What's one thing you could do to show them it's not true?"
4. Help them feel agency: "You know it's not true. Your action will demonstrate that."

## When to Use It

- After making a mistake in a meeting
- When you hear critical feedback about yourself
- When you're worried about how a leader perceives you
- When your work is criticized publicly
- Anytime you feel that "punch" of ego injury

## The Bigger Impact

This framework has two levels of value:

1. **Crisis recovery** - It helps you move through moments of failure quickly

2. **Reducing fear of failure** - When you know how to recover from punches, you're less afraid of taking them. This makes you more willing to speak up, share half-baked ideas, and take on challenging projects

> "If you can help people be less afraid of getting the punch, that's 90% of the challenge of actually improving some of these skills... So many people don't put themselves out there because they're afraid of how it's going to go."
