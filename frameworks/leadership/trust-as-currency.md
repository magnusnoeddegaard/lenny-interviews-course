# Trust as Currency

> "Trust is just built by repeatedly setting and meeting expectations. And I think that's a good mantra to think about as a PM. Am I meeting the expectations that I set? And not just doing good things, but calling your shots, forecasting, setting a goal, and then hitting it." - Ian McAllister

## What It Is

Trust as Currency is a framework for understanding how product managers and leaders earn influence and resources within an organization. Ian McAllister identifies trust as the currency of product leadership—particularly crucial for those seeking to grow into more senior roles.

The key insight is that trust isn't built through impressive ideas or even good intentions. It's built through a simple, repeatable pattern: set expectations, then meet them. Do this consistently, and you accumulate trust. Violate it, and you deplete your account.

This concept became particularly clear to McAllister later in his career, partly through mentoring his wife Sarah (a PM at AWS) and observing how trust-building became her superpower.

## How It Works

**Trust-Building Behaviors:**
- Tell the truth without fail
- Launch when you say you'll launch
- Launch what you said you'd launch
- Own your mistakes
- Set goals and hit them
- Call your shots (forecast, then deliver)

**Trust-Depleting Behaviors:**
- Lying or being evasive
- Missing commitments without acknowledgment
- Ignoring or repeating mistakes
- Telling different people different things
- Overpromising and underdelivering

**The Compound Effect:**
Trust compounds like currency. Consistent deposits over time give you the ability to:
- Ask for more resources and get them
- Take on larger scope
- Be given the benefit of the doubt when things go wrong
- Have your recommendations followed without extensive justification

## How to Apply It

1. **Be Explicit About Expectations**: Don't leave commitments vague. State clearly what you will deliver and when.

2. **Track Your Commitments**: Maintain visibility into what you've promised. Don't overcommit.

3. **Communicate Early on Misses**: If you're going to miss an expectation, communicate before the deadline, not after.

4. **Own Mistakes Publicly**: When things go wrong, take responsibility clearly and show what you learned.

5. **Build Alliances Through Understanding**: Spend time understanding others' goals and working backwards from their objectives, not just your own.

## When to Use It

- Throughout your entire career (but especially critical as you get more senior)
- When building relationships with new stakeholders
- After making mistakes (how you respond determines trust impact)
- When asking for resources, scope, or support
- When you want to be given larger challenges

## The Airbnb Lesson

McAllister shares a candid reflection from his time at Airbnb: he focused intensely on building the customer support technology platform the "right way" (like Amazon would), but didn't invest enough in building trust with the customer support leadership team. Despite good work, the lack of that trust-building relationship meant the strategy wasn't carried out as effectively as it could have been.

The learning: even the right strategy can fail without the trust and relationships to support its execution.
