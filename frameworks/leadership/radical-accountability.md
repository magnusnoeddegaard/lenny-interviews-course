# Radical Accountability

> "That attitude of saying that every problem is our problem and radical accountability and ownership mentality helped us find opportunities that maybe the business wasn't explicitly asking us to solve, but we were able to triangulate why it might be important for the business for us to solve it." - Christopher Miller

## What It Is

Radical accountability is a team mindset where you treat every problem as your problem, regardless of your official charter or job description. It means proactively identifying opportunities, taking ownership of neglected areas, and asking for forgiveness rather than permission.

This approach was foundational to HubSpot's early growth team success. Rather than staying within their narrow "sales tool activation" remit, the team looked for any opportunity that could help the business grow - even if no one had asked them to work on it.

## How It Works

The radical accountability framework operates on several principles:

1. **No turf boundaries**: Your team's mission is whatever helps the business and customers
2. **Proactive problem-finding**: Actively seek out neglected problems before being asked
3. **Value triangulation**: Connect seemingly unrelated problems to business outcomes
4. **Bias to action**: Move forward without waiting for explicit permission
5. **Demonstrate hunger**: Success breeds trust, which expands your scope

At HubSpot, Miller's small growth team approached another team that owned the self-service pricing page. When they learned no one was actively working on it, they asked to take it over, immediately redesigned it, and drove step-function improvements in self-service revenue.

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit the landscape** - Look for neglected code bases, features, or processes that no one is actively improving
2. **Ask to take ownership** - Approach owners of underserved areas and offer to take them off their plate
3. **Ship fast, learn fast** - Once you have permission, move quickly to demonstrate value
4. **Connect wins to business outcomes** - Make it clear how your work drives metrics leadership cares about
5. **Build trust through delivery** - "We look hungry, so let's keep feeding us" - success expands your mandate
6. **Don't wait for alignment** - If you believe something matters, start working on it

## When to Use It

Radical accountability is most powerful when:

- **Building a new function or team**: Establishing credibility through wins
- **Working in growth**: Growth teams often need to operate across traditional boundaries
- **At a larger company with silos**: Finding gaps between team charters
- **When resources are constrained**: Doing more with less by focusing on high-leverage opportunities
- **Seeking career advancement**: Taking on more responsibility proactively

**Caution**: This approach requires delivering results. If you take on problems and don't solve them, you'll lose trust. The accountability must be matched by capability.
