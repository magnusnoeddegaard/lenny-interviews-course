# Conscious Leadership

> "Leadership is broadly defined as having influence in the world... by that definition, everyone is a leader because we all have influence in some way. The conscious piece is becoming more aware, waking up." - JM Nickels

## What It Is

Conscious Leadership is a philosophy that combines self-awareness with responsibility for the influence you have on others. It recognizes that everyone is a leader because everyone has influence—on their teams, their families, their communities, and the world through their actions and choices.

The "conscious" aspect involves waking up to your internal world: understanding your biases, questioning inherited belief systems from parents, culture, or community, and becoming aware of how your internal state affects your external impact. Rather than operating on autopilot with unexamined assumptions, conscious leaders actively examine their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

This approach shifts leadership from a hierarchical position to a state of being. It's not about having direct reports or a title—it's about recognizing that you co-create influence with everyone around you and taking responsibility for that reality.

## How It Works

**1. Awareness of Internal World**
- Notice your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations
- Identify inherited beliefs that may go unquestioned
- Recognize when you're operating from fear vs. trust

**2. Power Dynamics Sensitivity**
- Recognize that seniority creates imbalances where junior people feel less comfortable speaking up
- Understand that your position amplifies your words and actions
- Create space for others before sharing your perspective

**3. Shifting from Rightness to Co-creation**
- Move away from needing to be the "loudest, rightest voice in the room"
- Foster collaborative exploration rather than debate
- Recognize that great ideas emerge from collective intelligence

**4. Taking Responsibility**
- Own your influence rather than being at the effect of circumstances
- Shift from victim consciousness to creator consciousness
- Recognize how you co-create outcomes, even in situations beyond your control

## How to Apply It

1. **Start meetings by listening** - As you become more senior, speak last rather than first. Create space for others to share their perspectives before weighing in.

2. **Question inherited beliefs** - When you notice a strong reaction, ask yourself: "Where did this belief come from? Is it serving me and others?"

3. **Practice allowing emotions** - Instead of suppressing or fighting difficult emotions, acknowledge them without judgment and let them pass naturally.

4. **Shift from threat to trust** - Notice when you're operating from a fear/threat state (defensive, righteous) and consciously move toward a trusting, curious, open space.

5. **Recognize your influence** - At the end of each day, reflect on how you influenced others—positively and negatively—through your words, actions, and presence.

## When to Use It

- When you notice you're trying to control outcomes or force agreement
- In high-stakes meetings where fear and ego tend to dominate
- When receiving feedback feels threatening rather than useful
- When leading diverse teams with different perspectives
- During moments of organizational stress or uncertainty
- When you find yourself blaming others or circumstances
