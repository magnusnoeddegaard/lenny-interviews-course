# Safety-Reward-Purpose System

> "Out of those three, two of them sound really real and one of them sounds like fantasy, to most people. The safety system is pretty obvious to most people. When we're scared, afraid, uncertain, we have doubt, we're resentful, angry, apathetic, etc. This system of our brain is trying to restore our standing in the universe." - Evan LaPointe

## What It Is

The brain operates through three primary systems that determine how people think, behave, and make decisions at work. Understanding which system is active in yourself and others helps explain behavior and enables better leadership.

Most workplaces over-rely on safety and reward to motivate people (fear and incentives), while underutilizing purpose—which actually produces the highest quality work and decision-making. Science shows purpose activates deeper regions of the brain responsible for creativity, problem-solving, and connection to others.

## How It Works

### 1. Safety System
- Activates when people feel scared, uncertain, doubtful, resentful, or angry
- Brain's objective becomes restoring security, not productive work
- If someone feels unsafe in a meeting, their goal is no longer contributing—it's getting back to safety
- Common triggers: criticism, blame, job uncertainty, public embarrassment

### 2. Reward System
- Activates when pursuing incentives, bonuses, promotions, or recognition
- Creates a transactional mindset: "That's not my job" comes from here
- Drives narrow focus on specific outcomes
- More effective than safety, but still limited in scope

### 3. Purpose System
- Activates when people understand the impact of their work AND care about the people affected
- Works at any scale—from curing cancer to writing a thoughtful email
- Connects to the anterior insular cortex, which considers other humans in your solutions
- Creates the highest-quality thinking and strongest engagement

## How to Apply It

1. **Diagnose active systems** - When someone behaves strangely in a meeting, ask: Is their safety system activated? Are they purely in reward mode?

2. **Answer the "why" question properly** - The brain craves answers to "Why should I do this?" You can answer with safety ("or else bad things happen"), reward ("you'll get this"), or purpose ("because our work matters to real people")

3. **Lead with purpose** - Stop being negligent about explaining the human impact of work. Connect every task to the people who benefit

4. **Remove safety triggers** - Phrases like "I completely disagree" activate combat mode. Instead say "I have a question" or "Help me understand the connection"

5. **Build purpose into your habitat** - Create environments where purpose is the default explanation for work, not fear or incentives

## When to Use It

- When motivating teams on difficult projects
- When diagnosing why someone is disengaged or defensive
- When designing team culture and communication norms
- When someone's behavior in meetings seems irrational
- When building your "habitat" (culture) for high performance
