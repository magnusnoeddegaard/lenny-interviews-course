# Three Reactive Postures

> "Wanting to be approved, wanting to be loved, wanting other people to like you... that was me in my early part of my career... But there came a point where I gave away so much power that it was hurting me when it came to purpose and execution and decisiveness." - Ken Norton

## What It Is

The Three Reactive Postures describe the different ways people retreat into reactive (fear-based) leadership. Understanding your default posture helps you recognize your patterns and begin the shift toward creative leadership.

Most people have one dominant posture, though you may recognize aspects of all three. Importantly, these aren't flaws to eliminate—each posture usually started as an effective strategy that now has costs.

## How It Works

### 1. Complying (Move Toward)
**The "Heart" Type**

- **Need**: To be approved, loved, liked, accepted
- **Behavior**: Meeting others' expectations, pleasing them, seeking their approval
- **Strength**: Empathy, listening, making others feel heard
- **Cost**: Giving away power, lack of decisiveness, inability to say no

Ken Norton describes this as his own early pattern: "No one necessarily knew what [product management] even was. I had no authority and most people could just ignore me if they wanted to. And so, I had to meet other people's expectations, please them, want to be accepted by them, seek their approval."

### 2. Protecting (Move Away)
**The "Head" Type**

- **Need**: To be right, to be safe from criticism
- **Behavior**: Distance, arrogance, criticism of others, retreating into your own ideas
- **Strength**: Analytical thinking, intellectual rigor
- **Cost**: Isolation, inability to collaborate, perceived coldness

This posture manifests as intellectual superiority or withdrawal. Rather than seeking approval, these leaders protect themselves by creating distance and relying on being the smartest person in the room.

### 3. Controlling (Move Against)
**The "Gut" Type**

- **Need**: To win, dominate, be in control
- **Behavior**: My way or the highway, autocratic decisions, driving for results at any cost
- **Strength**: Decisiveness, execution, getting things done
- **Cost**: Burns out teams, creates fear, limits others' growth

This is the stereotypical "tough" leader—commanding, directive, and unwilling to show vulnerability.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your dominant posture** - Which description made you uncomfortable? Which resonates most with how you operate under stress?

2. **Recognize the strength underneath** - Your posture started as an effective adaptation. The people-pleaser genuinely cares about others. The controller genuinely cares about results.

3. **Notice the cost** - What's your posture costing you now? For Ken Norton, complying meant "I gave away so much power that it was hurting me when it came to purpose and execution and decisiveness."

4. **Avoid the opposite trap** - If you're a compier, the answer isn't becoming a controller. Ken Norton: "If you had told me early in my career, 'You've just got to be more pushy'... I was like, 'I don't want to be like that. That guy's a jerk.'" All reactive postures are equally ineffective.

5. **Find the creative expression** - How can your underlying strength serve you from a creative (not reactive) place? Ken Norton kept his empathy but redefined success as "long-term admiration" rather than "being liked right now."

## When to Use It

Use this framework when:

- You're noticing reactive patterns in your leadership
- You're receiving feedback about blind spots
- You feel stuck despite having the skills
- You want to understand your default stress response
