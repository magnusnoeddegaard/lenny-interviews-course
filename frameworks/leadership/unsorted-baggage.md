# Unsorted Baggage

> "What he rightly asserts is that we all have unsorted baggage, and at some point we're going to pay the price of not sorting that baggage. And the price more often than not is in tears." - Jerry Colonna, quoting Bruce Springsteen

## What It Is

Unsorted Baggage refers to the unprocessed experiences, beliefs, and patterns from our childhood that continue to drive our adult behavior—especially under stress. The concept comes from Bruce Springsteen's autobiography, where he discusses spending 25 years in psychoanalysis to address his own baggage.

The core insight: we as children are socialized to develop bypassing skills rather than consciousness skills. We learn to push away discomfort rather than understand it. This works temporarily, but the baggage doesn't disappear—it waits. Eventually, we pay the price.

As Jerry observes, this price can manifest as depression, sabotaged relationships, blown-up businesses, or what we vaguely call "midlife crisis" (which spans roughly ages 35-70—the bulk of our adult lives).

## How It Works

**The Bypass Mechanism:**

When we encounter discomfort, we develop bypass strategies:
- Workaholism (staying busy to avoid feelings)
- Substance use
- "Spiritual bypassing" (using meditation, plant medicine, or wellness culture to avoid real work)
- Achievement addiction (using success to prove worthiness)
- Acquiring things (the nice couch, house, car that we think will make us feel safe)

**The Pattern:**
1. Childhood creates certain beliefs (I'm not good enough, I need to achieve to be loved, etc.)
2. We develop bypass strategies to manage the anxiety these beliefs create
3. The strategies work temporarily, creating outward success
4. Eventually, the strategies fail or become unsustainable
5. The original unprocessed material demands attention—often through crisis

**The Team Dimension:**

Unsorted baggage doesn't just affect individuals—it shapes entire teams. Carl Jung said: "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate."

Applied to organizations: Until leaders make their unconscious patterns conscious, those patterns will direct their teams, and everyone will blame each other.

Jerry shares the example of a CEO whose team deflected every difficult conversation with humor—exactly like the CEO's family of origin did. The team was unconsciously recreating the CEO's childhood coping mechanism.

## How to Apply It

1. **Acknowledge the baggage exists**
   - Everyone has it. The question isn't whether, but what.
   - "We all have unsorted baggage" is liberating, not damning.

2. **Pay now or pay later**
   - Smaller tears now prevent larger tears later
   - It's a ticking time bomb that gets more expensive to defuse over time
   - "Sorting" your baggage is an investment in future capacity

3. **Identify your bypass strategies**
   - What do you do when uncomfortable feelings arise?
   - How do you maintain the illusion that everything's fine?
   - What would happen if you couldn't use that strategy?

4. **Connect adult patterns to childhood origins**
   - Why do you choose certain kinds of jobs, relationships, or teams?
   - What feels "familiar" about dysfunctional situations?
   - How might your current challenges be replaying old scripts?

5. **Leaders: do your work first**
   - If you have the most power, your unsorted baggage affects everyone
   - Teams become manifestations of their leader's early dysfunction
   - "If you want to create a high-functioning team, do your work, and it starts with the person who has the most power"

## When to Use It

- When you notice you're repeatedly attracted to the same dysfunctional patterns
- When success doesn't bring the satisfaction you expected
- When teams keep having the same problems despite changing people
- When you find yourself sabotaging good situations
- During any "midlife" questioning (which can start at 35)
- When bypass strategies (work, substances, achievement) stop working
