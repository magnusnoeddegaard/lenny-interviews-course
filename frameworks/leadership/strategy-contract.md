# Strategy Contract (Goal-Hypothesis-Data-Solution)

> "More junior leaders, and I was certainly in that camp earlier on, kept focusing on the solutions and debating the right solution when in fact you should really be debating upstream of that. You should be debating the interpretation of data, you should be debating the hypotheses and the different ideas that you have there as to what's really going on or you should be debating the goals themselves." - Geoff Charles

## What It Is

The Strategy Contract is Ramp's framework for creating empowered teams through layered alignment. Instead of debating solutions directly, teams align progressively on goals, hypotheses, data interpretation, and potential solutions—in that order. Once aligned on the upstream layers, solution debates become dramatically simpler because the criteria for success are already agreed upon.

The key insight is that most team conflict happens at the wrong level. People argue about what to build when they haven't agreed on what problem they're solving, what success looks like, or what evidence they're using. By moving debates "upstream," you empower teams to own their solutions.

At Ramp, every pod publishes its own strategy document following this structure. Leaders review these documents to ensure alignment with company-level strategy and financial plans—but the teams own the content.

## How It Works

**The Four Layers (in order):**

1. **Goals** - What do you want to see in the world? What's the outcome you're driving toward?

2. **Hypothesis** - Why do you think this will work? What's the theory of change? Why is the company uniquely positioned to achieve this goal?

3. **Data** - What evidence supports your hypothesis? How will you measure whether you're reaching the goal?

4. **Solutions** - Given the goal, hypothesis, and data, what do you want to build or do?

**Why order matters:**
When leaders are prescriptive about solutions without explaining the upstream layers, teams feel disempowered and confused. "Whenever things went wrong at Ramp, it was when I was being prescriptive with regards to the solution without actually explaining and aligning upstream on the goal, the hypothesis, and the data."

Conversely, when teams are aligned on goals and hypotheses, "the solutions actually can come much better from teams that are much closer to the ground."

## How to Apply It

**For Leaders:**

1. **Stop debating solutions** - When you find yourself arguing about what to build, step back. Ask: "Are we aligned on the goal?"

2. **Invest time in context-sharing** - "I spent most of my time just repeating myself, most of my time just sharing the context that I think they might be missing."

3. **Represent your teams in rooms they can't be in** - Gather information from leadership meetings, customer conversations, and cross-functional discussions—then share it back.

4. **Create the alignment contract** - The formal contract between a team and leadership is the strategy document (goals, hypotheses, data, metrics) plus the roadmap and timing.

**For Teams:**

1. **Publish your strategy** - Each pod writes its own strategy document covering goals, hypotheses, metrics, initiatives, risks, and long-term outcomes.

2. **Post goals weekly** - "All my directs post their goals every week first thing Monday. The goal there is to also have them review each other's goals."

3. **Escalate upstream conflicts** - If you disagree on solutions, diagnose where alignment breaks down. Is it the goal? The hypothesis? The data interpretation?

**For Organizations:**

1. **Align pod strategies with company strategy** - "What I typically do is take all these documents and make sure that they're aligned with our high-level product strategy."

2. **Tie strategy to financial plans** - Each lever in the financial plan has an owner. For product-led areas, product owns that lever.

3. **Make teams think like leaders** - "The more that, as a leader, you make teams think like you, the more leverage you get over time."

## When to Use It

- When teams are debating solutions without progress
- When leaders are too prescriptive about what to build
- When launching new products or entering new markets
- During planning processes (quarterly or biannual)
- When scaling from a small team to multiple pods

## The Shift in Manager Behavior

The strategy contract changes what managers do day-to-day:

**Before:** Check in on work, give feedback on solutions, approve designs and specs

**After:** Share context, coach on hypotheses and data interpretation, highlight risks and one-way decisions, step back once alignment exists

"My goal is to continue giving them context to execute on that and to coach them through that by getting firsthand data on how things are going that they might be missing. And their role is to highlight risks and highlight one-way decisions that they need my input on."
