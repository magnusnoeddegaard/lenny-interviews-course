# Radical Trust Building

> "Building in public, showing you our meetings, uncomfortably so, is an act in, 'If we were them, why should they trust us? Why should anyone trust us?' We have your most sensitive personal data. We have your most sensitive professional data. Why should you trust us if we've had our trust broken again and again?" - Josh Miller

## What It Is

Radical Trust Building is a philosophy that recognizes trust can't be built through policies, statements, or promises alone—it must be earned through authentic human connection. In an era where people have lost trust in tech companies, the solution isn't better PR or legal language, but letting people genuinely get to know you.

The approach involves sharing behind-the-scenes content that feels uncomfortably transparent: real meetings, real discussions, real disagreements. Not polished corporate content, but authentic glimpses into how decisions actually get made and who the people are behind the product.

This is especially critical for products that handle sensitive data (like browsers), where "trust us" isn't enough. If users have been burned by tech companies before, they'll assume the worst about you unless you give them reason not to.

## How It Works

The framework operates on several insights:

1. **Trust is earned through knowing people**: Just like in personal relationships, trust develops when you get to know someone. Corporate facades prevent this.

2. **Policies don't build trust**: You can have the best privacy policy in the world, but people won't believe it unless they trust you.

3. **Imperfection builds credibility**: Showing your flaws, mistakes, and ordinary human qualities is more trustworthy than polished perfection.

4. **Content creates relationship**: Through videos, podcasts, and social media, you can let people feel like they know your team before they use your product.

5. **Vulnerability invites trust**: When you share something uncomfortable (like a difficult meeting), it signals you're not hiding anything.

## How to Apply It

1. **Show real meetings**: Film actual internal discussions—not scripted, not edited for comfort. Show disagreements and how they get resolved.

2. **Let the team be seen**: Don't just feature founders. Show engineers, designers, and other team members as real people with personalities.

3. **Share the messy parts**: When things go wrong, talk about it. Perfection is suspicious.

4. **Respond to criticism openly**: When someone interprets your actions negatively, engage with their perspective rather than dismissing it.

5. **Accept the risk**: This approach can backfire if content gets taken out of context. Decide if the trust benefits outweigh these risks.

6. **Keep the CEO in check**: Be aware of the risk of founder hero-worship. The goal is building trust in the company and team, not creating a cult of personality.

## When to Use It

- When your product requires high user trust (data, privacy, security)
- When competing against incumbents who have lost user trust
- When your company culture is genuinely a differentiator worth showing
- When you're trying to attract talent who care about authentic workplaces
- When traditional marketing feels hollow or ineffective

## Cautions

Josh Miller explicitly names risks with this approach:

- **CEO centrality**: If content gravitates too much toward the founder, it can feel like ego rather than transparency
- **Taking it too far**: Not everything should be public; some things genuinely need privacy
- **Misinterpretation**: People who haven't yet developed trust may interpret vulnerable content in the worst possible way
