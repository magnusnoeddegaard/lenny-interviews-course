# Vision-Mission Framework

> "The vision is the nirvana state that you aim to enable for your users and customers in five to 10 years. It's something that could equally be enabled by your competitors if you don't execute effectively or efficiently or quickly enough." - Ben Williams

## What It Is

A framework for crafting vision and mission statements that provide clear direction and alignment for teams. The key insight is that vision describes an imagined better future state that is completely agnostic of your company, product, or solution—it could theoretically be achieved by competitors. The mission then describes your unique approach to achieving that vision.

This framework can be applied at every level of an organization, from company-wide to individual team level, creating a cascade of aligned purpose statements that connect daily work to larger organizational goals.

## How It Works

### The Vision Statement
- Describes the nirvana state for users/customers in 5-10 years
- Should be prefixable with "In the future..."
- Bound to your target market (not too wide, not too narrow)
- **Critical rule**: Must NOT mention your company, product, or anything solution-related
- Could theoretically be achieved by competitors

### The Mission Statement
- Describes HOW you will realize the vision
- Answers what you will do and how you'll do it
- Should encode your unique differentiating advantage
- What you will relentlessly iterate on to move closer to the vision

### Example (Snyk Growth Group)
- **Vision**: "Every developer securely unleashes their creativity"
- **Mission**: "To connect every developer and their organizations to the value of the Snyk platform with frictionless self-serve adoption and expansion"

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with the vision** - Imagine the ideal future state for your users in 5-10 years. Strip away any mention of your company or product. Ask: "What future do we want to enable?"

2. **Pressure-test the vision** - Can you prefix it with "In the future..."? Is it truly solution-agnostic? Is it bounded to your market but not too narrow?

3. **Craft the mission** - Define your unique approach to achieving that vision. What will you do? How will you do it differently? What advantages do you have?

4. **Cascade it down** - Apply this framework at every level—company, group, team—with each level's vision/mission supporting the level above

5. **Use it for alignment** - Everyone should be able to easily answer why they're there and why their work matters

## When to Use It

- When forming new teams or groups
- During strategic planning sessions
- When teams feel misaligned or lack clear direction
- When hiring to communicate team purpose
- When making prioritization decisions (does this serve our vision/mission?)
