# Leaders in the Details

> "There's this negative term called micromanagement. I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is like telling people exactly what to do, and being in the details. Being in the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job?" - Brian Chesky

## What It Is

Leaders in the Details is a framework that distinguishes between two commonly conflated concepts: micromanagement and being in the details. While micromanagement is about controlling others' work by telling them exactly what to do, being in the details is about understanding the work deeply enough to evaluate quality and identify problems.

The insight is that boards hold CEOs accountable by understanding details—they don't manage the CEO, but they know enough to evaluate their work. The same should be true of any leader. You can't evaluate performance, provide meaningful development, or make good decisions without understanding what's actually happening.

Many leaders avoid getting involved because they fear being labeled a micromanager. But the result is often worse: they can't tell if work is good, they miss problems until it's too late, and they're forced into reactive crisis management.

## How It Works

**Micromanagement (Avoid)**
- Telling people exactly what to do
- Prescribing specific methods and approaches
- Removing autonomy and decision-making
- Making people feel they can't act independently

**Being in the Details (Embrace)**
- Understanding what's happening across projects
- Having enough context to evaluate quality
- Being able to identify bottlenecks and blockers
- Knowing when someone needs help vs. is struggling

**The Board Analogy**
Think about how a responsible board interacts with a CEO:
- They receive regular updates and review work
- They ask probing questions
- They understand the business well enough to evaluate decisions
- They hold the CEO accountable for results
- They do NOT tell the CEO exactly what to do

Leaders should apply this same pattern with their teams.

## How to Apply It

1. **Establish regular reviews** - Create a cadence where you see the actual work (not just status updates), similar to how Brian Chesky reviews every project weekly to monthly

2. **Ask questions, don't prescribe** - When you see something concerning, ask "Why is this approach?" rather than "Do it this way"

3. **Know enough to evaluate** - If you can't tell whether work is good or bad, you're not in the details enough

4. **Identify individual blockers** - Being in the details means you can trace problems to specific people who need help

5. **Create transparency systems** - Build systems (dashboards, reviews, documentation) that make details visible without requiring you to attend every meeting

6. **Balance depth with breadth** - You can't be in every detail equally; prioritize the most important projects and decisions

## When to Use It

- When you're uncertain about the quality of work in your organization
- When problems consistently surprise you
- When you can't evaluate team performance meaningfully
- When teams feel disconnected from leadership priorities
- When you've been told to "delegate more" but sense something is wrong

## Common Pitfalls

**Over-correcting to micromanagement**
- Getting in the details should increase your understanding, not your control
- If people feel they can't make decisions without you, you've gone too far

**Confusing presence with understanding**
- Attending meetings doesn't mean you're in the details
- You need to understand the work, not just the calendar

**Uneven application**
- Being deeply in some details while ignoring others creates blind spots
- Create systematic visibility, not pet-project focus
