# Small Is a Great Destination

> "Small is not just a stepping stone, small is a great destination itself. Also, if you think you're too small to be effective, you've never been in bed with a mosquito." - Jason Fried

## What It Is

Small Is a Great Destination challenges the default assumption that companies should always be trying to grow bigger. In startup culture, small is typically seen as a phase—something you pass through on your way to becoming large. This framework rejects that premise entirely.

Being small can be the goal, not the starting point. A 50-person company generating healthy profits might be exactly the right size—not a failure to reach 500 people, but a deliberate choice to stay focused, nimble, and human-scale.

This matters because the costs of growth are real but rarely discussed: complexity, bureaucracy, communication overhead, loss of craft, reduced individual impact, increased politics. Growth solves some problems but creates others. Small avoids many of those problems entirely.

## How It Works

**The Default Narrative**:
- Start small (necessary evil)
- Grow fast (the exciting part)
- Get big (success!)
- Small = temporary, big = destination

**The Alternative Narrative**:
- Start small (beginning)
- Stay small (choice)
- Remain profitable and happy (success!)
- Small = destination, big = option you declined

**What Small Enables**:
- Everyone knows everyone
- Communication stays direct
- Quality stays high (fewer layers of review)
- Speed stays fast (fewer approvals)
- Culture stays coherent
- Craft remains valued
- Individuals have outsized impact

**The Numbers** (37signals example):
- ~75 employees
- 100,000+ paying customers
- Double-digit million dollar profits annually
- 24 years of profitability
- Competitors with 1,500-3,000 employees, similar customer counts

## How to Apply It

1. **Question the growth assumption**: When someone says "we should grow," ask "why?" Make growth justify itself.

2. **Count the costs of growth**: What do you lose by doubling? Tripling? Make those costs explicit.

3. **Celebrate small success**: Company doing $10M with 20 people is often better than $100M with 500 people. Recognize this.

4. **Define "right size" for you**: What's the team size where you know everyone? Where communication is direct? Where you enjoy the work?

5. **Resist the comparisons**: Competitors with 10x your headcount aren't necessarily 10x more successful. Often they're just 10x more complicated.

6. **Focus on efficiency, not headcount**: Revenue per employee > total employees. Profit > revenue.

## When to Use It

- Setting company strategy and growth targets
- Deciding whether to hire
- Evaluating your company against competitors
- Choosing between funding options
- Building company culture and values
