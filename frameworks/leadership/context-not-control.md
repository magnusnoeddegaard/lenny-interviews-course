# Context Not Control

> "Part of my job is to make sure that people have the context they need to do their jobs well." - Elizabeth Stone

## What It Is

Context Not Control is Netflix's leadership philosophy that replaces command-and-control management with radical information sharing. Instead of telling people what to do and checking their work, leaders share what they know—including information that might typically stay in the "leadership room"—so that talented people can make great decisions independently.

The premise is that if you've hired well (high talent density), your people don't need to be told what to do. They need the same information you have. With proper context, smart people will reach good conclusions on their own.

Elizabeth Stone practices this by taking notes in leadership meetings and sharing them with her entire organization—including candid reflections on what isn't going well and debates that are still unresolved. This transparency might feel uncomfortable, but it builds trust and enables autonomy.

## How It Works

The framework inverts traditional information flow:

**Traditional approach:**
- Leaders absorb information → make decisions → communicate directives → check compliance

**Context Not Control:**
- Leaders absorb information → share it broadly → people make informed decisions → leaders provide feedback and course correction

This requires:
1. **Trust in your people** - You must believe they'll use information responsibly
2. **Comfort with transparency** - Some things feel risky to share, but the default should be openness
3. **Active context-sharing** - It's not enough to be transparent when asked; you must proactively push information out

## How to Apply It

1. **Default to sharing** - Ask yourself "Why shouldn't I share this?" rather than "Why should I?" Only withhold truly confidential information.

2. **Take notes and distribute them** - After leadership meetings or key discussions, write up what happened and share it widely. Include the debates, not just the conclusions.

3. **Share the "why" behind decisions** - When you make a call, explain your reasoning. Even if people disagree, they'll understand the logic and can execute effectively.

4. **Be candid about uncertainty** - Share what you don't know, what's being debated, and where things might change. This builds trust and prepares people for potential shifts.

5. **Push context, don't wait for questions** - Don't assume people will ask. Proactively share what's on your mind, what leadership is focused on, and what you're worried about.

## When to Use It

- As a default leadership practice with your team
- After executive or strategy meetings
- When people seem confused about priorities or direction
- When you notice teams making decisions that suggest they lack important information
- When building a culture of transparency in a new organization
