# Ideas Need Champions

> "Ideas need champions. They need champions willing to put themselves on the line for them. If you believe in something and you've made your case and you can really make your case, have the courage of your convictions and get behind it and fight as hard as you can for it." - Bob Baxley

## What It Is

This framework comes from the story of John Houbolt and the Apollo moon landing. When President Kennedy announced America would go to the moon, NASA had three competing approaches: direct ascent (championed by Wernher von Braun), Earth orbit rendezvous, and lunar orbit rendezvous.

Houbolt believed lunar orbit rendezvous was the only viable approach—sending a smaller spacecraft down to the moon's surface rather than landing the whole rocket. But the idea wasn't gaining traction within NASA's hierarchy. So he took a career-risking move: he wrote a famous nine-page memo to senior leadership, beginning "somewhat as a voice in the wilderness," passionately making the case for his approach.

The idea was originally theorized by Yuri Kondrachuk in Ukraine in 1918—a man on the plains of Ukraine actually thinking about how to get to the moon. Houbolt found this paper years later and became its champion. Eventually, NASA adopted lunar orbit rendezvous, and even von Braun acknowledged Houbolt's contribution.

## How It Works

The framework reveals three key truths about ideas and innovation:

1. **Ideas wait for their moment** - Kondrachuk's concept sat dormant for decades until someone dusted it off. Good ideas somehow find a way to live on, waiting for the right champion.

2. **Ideas need advocates, not just merit** - A technically superior solution won't win on logic alone. Someone must be willing to fight for it through organizational resistance.

3. **Championing requires personal risk** - Houbolt went around the hierarchy and could have been fired. Real advocacy means putting yourself on the line.

4. **Be patient but persistent** - Even after Houbolt's famous memo, it took another year before NASA adopted the approach. Champions must sustain their advocacy over time.

5. **It's about the idea, not you** - Champions should understand they're advocating for ideas, not for themselves. This reframing helps people overcome reluctance to "self-promote."

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify ideas worth fighting for** - Not every idea deserves championship. Look for insights that could be transformational if only they got fair consideration.

2. **Make your case rigorously** - Houbolt's memo worked because it went through "all the math." Champions need both passion and substance.

3. **Go around hierarchy when necessary** - If normal channels aren't working for a genuinely important idea, be willing to escalate.

4. **Distinguish yourself from the idea** - When sharing ideas publicly or fighting for them internally, remember you're serving the idea, not promoting yourself.

5. **Stay patient** - Major ideas may take years to gain acceptance. Don't interpret initial resistance as final rejection.

6. **Document your advocacy** - Houbolt's written memo created a clear record. Put important ideas in writing.

## When to Use It

- When you've identified a better approach that isn't getting traction
- When organizational politics are blocking a good idea
- When you're reluctant to advocate publicly because it feels like self-promotion
- When deciding whether to take career risks for something you believe in
- When an important idea keeps getting shot down in meetings
