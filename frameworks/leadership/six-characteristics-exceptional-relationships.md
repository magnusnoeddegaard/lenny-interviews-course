# Six Characteristics of Exceptional Relationships

> "You know your relationship has become exceptional when you and the other person don't have to hide important parts of yourself and can deal with major issues even if it feels scary." - Carole Robin

## What It Is

This framework defines what makes a relationship "exceptional" versus merely functional. Relationships exist on a continuum: at one end is "contact and no connection" (think thousands of Facebook friends—not real relationships). At the other end is "exceptional."

The six characteristics aren't a checklist to complete; they're qualities that naturally deepen as you move along the relationship continuum. The more of each characteristic that exists, the closer to exceptional you are. Understanding these characteristics helps you identify what's missing in important relationships and what skills to develop.

Importantly, not every relationship needs to be exceptional—that would be impractical and exhausting. But the skills required to build exceptional relationships are the same skills needed to move any relationship from dysfunctional to at least robust and functional.

## How It Works

**The Six Characteristics:**

1. **I am more known by you**
   - I've disclosed important things about myself
   - You understand my fears, hopes, values, and struggles
   - I don't have to hide significant parts of who I am
   - Requires: willingness to be vulnerable and disclose appropriately

2. **I know you better**
   - I've invested in understanding you deeply
   - I know what matters to you beyond surface-level facts
   - Requires: curiosity, listening skills, and asking good questions

3. **We trust that our disclosures won't be used against us**
   - Confidentiality is maintained
   - Vulnerabilities shared aren't weaponized later
   - This trust enables further disclosure
   - Requires: demonstrated trustworthiness over time

4. **We can be honest with each other**
   - We give each other feedback—both constructive and complimentary
   - We can say difficult things without destroying the relationship
   - Honesty is motivated by care for the other person
   - Requires: feedback skills and courage

5. **We know how to resolve conflict productively**
   - Disagreements don't become relationship-ending events
   - We can repair after things go sideways
   - Conflict becomes an opportunity for deeper understanding
   - Requires: repair skills and commitment to work through difficulty

6. **We are committed to each other's learning and growth**
   - I want you to become the best version of yourself
   - I'm willing to tell you hard truths that serve your development
   - Our relationship is generative, not just transactional
   - Requires: genuine care for the other person's wellbeing

## How to Apply It

**Diagnose Current Relationships:**
1. Pick an important relationship
2. Rate each characteristic on a scale of 1-10
3. Notice which characteristics are weakest
4. Focus development efforts there

**Build Skills Incrementally:**
- Start with characteristic #1 and #2 (being known and knowing the other)
- These create the foundation for #3 (trust)
- Trust enables #4 (honesty) and #5 (conflict resolution)
- All five support #6 (mutual commitment to growth)

**Move Relationships Along the Continuum:**
- Dysfunctional → Functional: Focus on basic trust and communication
- Functional → Robust: Add honest feedback and conflict resolution
- Robust → Exceptional: Deepen all six characteristics

**Accept Intentional Limits:**
- Not every relationship needs to be exceptional
- Decide consciously which relationships deserve this investment
- Use the same skills at lighter intensity for functional-but-not-exceptional relationships

## When to Use It

- Evaluating your most important relationships (work and personal)
- Understanding why a relationship feels unsatisfying despite no obvious problems
- Identifying what skills to develop for better relationships
- Building your leadership capability (exceptional relationships with key people create leverage)
- Coaching others on relationship development
