# Three Levels of Listening

> "You got to put your attention out. Focus on the other person... It's a coaching skill." - Heidi Helfand

## What It Is

The Three Levels of Listening is a framework from Co-Active Coaching (developed by the Co-Active Training Institute) that distinguishes between three qualities of attention we bring to conversations. By understanding and intentionally moving between these levels, leaders can have more impactful conversations and build stronger relationships.

Listening is a muscle that can be developed. Most people default to Level 1 listening, but the most powerful conversations happen at Levels 2 and 3.

## How It Works

### Level 1: Internal Listening

**Focus**: On yourself
**Experience**: You're physically present but mentally elsewhere

At Level 1, you're listening through your own filters:
- Thinking about what you'll say next
- Relating everything to your own experience
- Worrying about something unrelated
- Judging what the other person is saying

*Example*: Someone is telling you about their project challenges, but you're thinking about what you're having for lunch.

Level 1 isn't bad—it's natural and sometimes necessary. But staying at Level 1 limits your ability to truly understand and help others.

### Level 2: Focused Listening

**Focus**: On the other person
**Experience**: Complete attention directed outward

At Level 2, you're fully present with the speaker:
- Anchored entirely to them
- Noticing their words, tone, and emotion
- Not thinking about yourself
- Curious about their experience

*Example*: You're so focused on understanding the other person that you lose track of time. You're not thinking about your response—just absorbing their reality.

Level 2 creates the sense that someone truly "gets" you.

### Level 3: Global/Environmental Listening

**Focus**: On the whole environment
**Experience**: Awareness expands beyond the conversation

At Level 3, you're aware of:
- The physical environment and what's happening around you
- Body language, micro-expressions, subtle shifts
- Energy and mood in the room
- What's not being said as much as what is

*Example*: You notice that every time someone mentions a particular colleague, they touch their neck or shift uncomfortably. Or you sense that the room's energy just changed when a topic came up.

Level 3 listening picks up information that's invisible at Levels 1 and 2.

## How to Apply It

### Moving from Level 1 to Level 2:

1. **Notice when you're in Level 1** - Catch yourself thinking about lunch, your response, or your own experience

2. **Redirect your attention outward** - Consciously shift focus to the other person

3. **If you drift back, redirect again** - This is normal; the skill is in the returning

4. **Make eye contact** - Physical connection helps maintain focus (if looking away, reconnect)

### Accessing Level 3:

1. **Expand your awareness** - Include the environment, not just the person

2. **Notice body language** - When they touch their neck, shift position, look away

3. **Trust your intuition** - If something feels off, it probably is

4. **Name what you notice** - "I noticed you touched your neck when you mentioned that project—what's going on there?"

### Practical Tips:

- **Put devices away** - They pull you to Level 1
- **Take notes sparingly** - Heavy note-taking keeps you in Level 1
- **Ask questions from curiosity** - Not from your agenda
- **Check in with yourself** - "What level am I at right now?"

## When to Use It

- **One-on-ones** - Deep listening builds trust and surfaces real issues
- **Coaching conversations** - Essential for helping others find their own answers
- **Difficult conversations** - Understanding the full picture before responding
- **Interviews** - Really hearing candidates beyond their prepared answers
- **Negotiations** - Picking up on what matters to the other party
- **Any important conversation** - When the stakes are high

## The Co-Active Coaching Connection

This framework comes from the Co-Active Training Institute (coactive.com), founded by Henry Kimsey-House and others. Co-Active Coaching is a widely used methodology that trains coaches to hold their clients as "naturally creative, resourceful, and whole."

The three levels of listening are foundational to the Co-Active approach, helping coaches stay fully present and notice information that drives deeper insight.
