# Founder vs CEO Distinction

> "To be a founder is a state of being, it's an attitude. To be a CEO is a craft. The more founders who can accept that those are two separate things and they're both equally important to build an ascendant startup, the better all of us will be." - Jonathan Lowenhar

## What It Is

Jonathan Lowenhar, after working with 165+ founders over a decade, observed a critical insight: when investors describe a "great founder," they use words like grit, tenacity, courage, and insight. When they describe a "great startup CEO," they use completely different words—skills like building products, selling, recruiting, raising capital, organizing humans, and financial planning.

This reveals that founder and CEO are fundamentally different roles that happen to be held by the same person. The skills that make you start a company are not the same skills that make you grow, scale, or exit one. Yet most founders never recognize this distinction, leading them to fail not because they lacked founder qualities, but because they never developed CEO skills.

The "Founder Mode" concept particularly frustrated Lowenhar because it gave founders permission to not learn the CEO craft—implying that professional management skills are somehow bad. The reality is that the greatest CEOs know when to calibrate between founder mode and manager mode based on what the situation requires.

## How It Works

**Founder Attributes (State of Being):**
- Grit and tenacity
- Courage to pursue unlikely ideas
- Insight and vision
- Capacity to push through despite evidence you're wasting time
- Intuition and pattern recognition
- Ability to operate at any level of granularity

**CEO Skills (Learnable Craft):**
- Building products and selling them
- Recruiting and retaining talent
- Raising capital
- Organizing humans and building culture
- Financial planning and management
- Running effective meetings and communications
- Strategic planning and goal-setting
- Managing a board

**The Evolution:**
- **Phase 1**: Build something people want to buy (founder-heavy)
- **Phase 2**: Build a company around that thing (CEO-heavy)

Both phases are always required. "Building a company is always the same—I don't care if it's MedTech or fintech or hardware or consumer."

**What Great Founder-CEOs Can Do:**
Unlike a "professional mercenary CEO" dropped in later, a founder-CEO who has developed both skill sets can:
- Drop into the most granular level (a product feature, a customer conversation, a long-time IC)
- Make an impact at that level
- Rise back up to the CEO cockpit and run the company again

This is the real "founder mode"—not an excuse to skip learning management, but an ability to play at any level while also leading at the highest level.

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit yourself honestly** - What are you great at? What are you weak at? What have you never done before?

2. **Recognize the gap** - Ask yourself: "Is there a gap between the CEO I am and the one my company needs me to be?"

3. **Learn the CEO craft** - Just like coding or product design, CEO skills are learnable:
   - How to read financial statements
   - How to run effective board meetings
   - How to plan a year and track progress
   - How to hire and manage people
   - How to communicate and run meetings

4. **Listen to the quiet voice** - If you sense something's off about how you're running the business, there probably is. The gap between founder instinct and CEO skill creates friction you can feel.

5. **Seek training** - Unlike founders, who often figure things out alone, CEO skills benefit from coaching, mentorship, and deliberate practice.

## When to Use It

- When feeling imposter syndrome as a CEO
- When your company has moved from "invention" to "building a business"
- When board meetings feel ineffective or scary
- When you're hiring executives but don't know how to manage them
- When making the transition from Series A to Series B and beyond
- When noticing you're great at starting things but struggle to scale them
