# Mental Model of Stakeholders

> "What is much more helpful than understanding what your CEO thinks is understanding how your CEO thinks. And when I feel confident that people on my team understand how I think, I don't need to read their emails, I don't need to approve things." - Hilary Gridley

## What It Is

Many organizations suffer from bottlenecks where every email, decision, or deliverable needs multiple approvals. The common diagnosis is "process problem" or "too much bureaucracy." But Hilary Gridley argues this is actually a mental model problem.

When team members don't understand how key stakeholders think, they can't predict how those stakeholders will react. This uncertainty creates the need for approval chains—not because the work is bad, but because nobody knows if it will land well.

The solution is to actively build and share mental models of how each important stakeholder thinks. When everyone operates from the same understanding of what the CEO cares about, what level of risk the company tolerates, and how each leader processes information, teams can move much faster without constant check-ins.

## How It Works

**The problem with artifact-based communication:**

Reading a strategy document gives you a snapshot of what someone thinks at one moment. But:
- Things change, especially in fast-moving environments
- Documents can't capture the reasoning behind decisions
- You learn what they decided, not how they decide

**The solution: model how they think, not what they think:**

Understanding *how* someone thinks allows you to predict:
- What questions they'll ask about your work
- What concerns will trigger them
- What level of detail they need
- What frames resonate with them
- How they'll react to new information

## How to Apply It

**As a leader, share your mental models:**

1. **Weekly stakeholder summaries** - Send your team quick rundowns of important conversations:
   - "Here's what [Person] said verbatim"
   - "Here's what I interpret that as"
   - "Here's why I think they said that"
   - "Here's what I'm going to do differently as a result"

2. **Real-time interpretation** - When you get feedback from executives, share both the feedback and your interpretation of what's behind it

3. **Pattern recognition** - When you notice themes across multiple interactions, synthesize and share: "I've noticed we're consistently getting this type of feedback. Here's why I think it matters to them..."

**Example from WHOOP:**

WHOOP's CEO, Will, consistently pushes for products that "feel like the future." Many people hear this as "throw maximum scope at everything."

Hilary's interpretation: Will wants products that showcase the unique value of having all your health data in one place. The key isn't maximum scope—it's finding high-impact, low-cost ways to make experiences feel magical and unprecedented.

By sharing this interpretation, her team can predict what will pass design review without needing her in every meeting.

**Building mental models of others:**

1. **Collect data points** - Note what they say, what they react to, what they push back on

2. **Look for the note behind the note** - Ask yourself: "Why might they be saying this? What insight are they bringing?"

3. **Assume positive intent** - Start from "What would be true for them to be right?" rather than looking for holes

4. **Trace formative experiences** - Understand their background, previous companies, past roles. These shape how people think.

## When to Use It

- When your team needs multiple approvals to get anything done
- When people are afraid to make decisions without checking
- When you hear "I don't know what leadership wants"
- When you want to empower faster autonomous decision-making
- When onboarding new team members to organizational dynamics

## The Empathy Foundation

This skill is fundamentally about empathy—understanding how another person experiences the world. Hilary credits reading fiction with developing this capability:

> "Your relationships become so much richer when you approach it with, 'What is the world of this person where the thing that they're saying makes sense?' I feel like so much of my frustration has come from being frustrated with other people. Actually, worse than that, I was making myself miserable and making myself pretty useless to the company."

When you stop looking for reasons to disagree and start trying to understand how someone's position makes sense from their perspective, you:
- Reduce your own frustration
- Become more effective at influencing them
- Model good organizational citizenship for your team
