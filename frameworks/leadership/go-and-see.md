# Go and See

> "It's very, very tempting to float up here as a leader and say, 'Hey, you take that hill over there. You guys do this over here.' When in fact, where you really learn where the challenges are, or the problems or the successes is by just being there with the people in the trenches." - Jeremy Henrickson

## What It Is

Go and See (known in lean manufacturing as "genchi genbutsu") is a leadership principle that requires leaders to personally observe the ground-level reality of their products, operations, and teams rather than relying on reports and abstractions.

The insight is that top-level communication is always insufficient to capture the critical details that matter. When you delegate understanding to others, you lose the nuance needed to make good decisions. The person who can walk into Ohio tax code documentation and understand exactly how local city taxes work will make fundamentally better product decisions than someone operating from secondhand summaries.

This isn't about micromanagement—it's about informed leadership. You don't need to do this everywhere, but you need to do it in enough places to understand what's actually happening.

## How It Works

The practice operates on several levels:

1. **Product Detail**: Get into the actual interface, the edge cases, the error states. Don't just review mockups—use the product.

2. **Technical Reality**: Talk directly with the engineer writing the code. Understand the actual constraints, not the summarized version.

3. **Domain Expertise**: Open the "big old textbook" on whatever domain you're building for. Read the regulations yourself. Understand the primary sources.

4. **Customer Experience**: Watch real customers use your product. See where they struggle, succeed, get confused.

**Example from Rippling**: When building global payroll, the head of payroll didn't just delegate research to specialists. They personally went deep into UK payroll requirements and discovered unexpected differences that completely changed their architectural approach. This early hands-on investigation informed how they built systems that could accommodate any country's requirements.

## How to Apply It

1. **Pick the hardest or most uncertain areas** - You can't go deep everywhere, so focus your personal investigation on what seems most complex or risky

2. **Go to primary sources** - Don't rely on summaries or interpretations. Read the actual documentation, regulations, or code

3. **Talk to the people doing the work** - Have direct conversations with the engineer writing the code, the designer making the interface, the customer using the product

4. **Make it a habit, not an event** - Regular check-ins at ground level keep you calibrated, not just one-time deep dives

5. **Use insights to set expectations** - When you've gone deep in some areas, it raises the bar for what you expect others to know about their areas

6. **Only then bring in specialists** - Once you understand the domain with a product mindset, then you can effectively leverage specialists who are "amazing at tax" but may not be great product thinkers

## When to Use It

- When entering a new domain or market you don't deeply understand
- When something seems to be going wrong but you're not sure why
- When making architectural or strategic decisions with long-term implications
- When onboarding to a new role or company
- Regularly, to maintain calibration on what's actually happening
