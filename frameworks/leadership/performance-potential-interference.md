# Performance Equals Potential Minus Interference

> "Performance equals potential minus interference. As a leader, one of the things that you are of course driving towards is trying to get better performance... But the key pieces of that, of course, is potential, so thinking about how you increase potential, which would be hiring really well, developing the talent and helping them grow. And then paired to that though of course is decreasing the interferences." - Katie Dill

## What It Is

This formula provides a clarifying lens for leadership: team performance is the result of potential (what your team could achieve) minus interference (what's holding them back). Leaders have two levers to pull—increasing potential and decreasing interference—and both matter enormously.

The insight is that you can hire the best people in the world, but if interferences hold them back, they'll underperform and burn out. Like a muscle atrophying under a cast, great talent stuck in broken processes will wither.

Katie Dill learned this formula at Airbnb and uses it constantly to think about growing and leading teams. It's particularly useful because it makes clear that leadership isn't just about hiring and developing people—it's equally about removing obstacles.

## How It Works

**Increasing Potential:**
- Hire well - bring in talented people with great judgment
- Develop talent - invest in growth and skill-building
- Create opportunities - give people chances to stretch and learn
- Build complementary teams - different perspectives increase collective potential

**Decreasing Interference:**
- Fix broken processes that slow people down
- Remove organizational friction and politics
- Clear ambiguity through better communication
- Eliminate unnecessary meetings and coordination overhead
- Update tooling and infrastructure that creates friction
- Address cultural issues that drain energy

The key is that as your company grows, you must continually do both. More people means processes strain. What worked for 10 people creates interference at 100.

## How to Apply It

1. **Diagnose which lever matters more** - Is your team underperforming because of capability gaps (potential) or because great people are stuck in bad systems (interference)?

2. **Audit interference regularly** - Ask your team: "What's slowing you down? What would help you do your best work?" Listen for systemic issues.

3. **Invest in both simultaneously** - Don't just hire more talent and ignore process. Don't just optimize process without developing people.

4. **Watch for atrophy signals** - When talented people burn out, seem frustrated, or produce mediocre work, interference is often the cause.

5. **Run hot intentionally** - Katie describes deliberately letting processes strain so you can learn what people actually need before redesigning.

## When to Use It

- When performance is lagging despite having talented people
- During rapid growth when processes start breaking
- When making leadership priorities decisions
- When diagnosing why a team isn't performing
- When onboarding as a new leader to understand the current state
- When retention is suffering among high performers
