# Three Pillars of Management

> "Management is just about, in my mind, having an outcome. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done." - Julie Zhuo

## What It Is

A foundational framework for understanding the three fundamental levers every manager has to achieve outcomes. These pillars apply whether you're managing people, AI agents, or hybrid teams.

The three pillars are:

1. **People** (or Resources) - The talent and tools available to do the work
2. **Purpose** - The clear goal and vision everyone is working toward
3. **Process** - How all the people and tools come together to produce results

This framework is especially relevant in the AI era, where the "people" pillar is expanding to include AI models and agents. The same management principles apply: you need to understand the strengths and capabilities of each resource, align them on purpose, and establish effective processes.

## How It Works

**Pillar 1: People (Resources)**
- Traditionally: hiring talent, building teams, assembling skills
- AI era: selecting models, understanding their strengths, creating the right "mix"
- Core skill: knowing capabilities and limitations of each resource
- Goal: "Assemble the Avengers" - right skills for the challenge

**Pillar 2: Purpose**
- Defining crystal clear outcomes
- Ensuring everyone knows what they're supposed to do
- Creating alignment on what success looks like
- Goal: No ambiguity about the destination

**Pillar 3: Process**
- How different people and tools come together
- Coordination and communication systems
- Workflows and handoffs
- Goal: Smooth, efficient execution

The framework reveals that managing AI is essentially the same as managing people: you still need clarity on goals, understanding of capabilities, and effective coordination.

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your people/resources** - Do you have the right mix of skills (human or AI) for your goals? Where are the gaps?

2. **Clarify your purpose** - Can everyone on the team (including yourself) articulate what success looks like? Is it specific enough?

3. **Design your process** - How will different resources coordinate? What's the workflow? Where might friction occur?

4. **Balance the three** - All three must be strong. A great team without clear purpose will flounder. Clear purpose without good process creates frustration.

5. **Apply to AI management** - Treat AI tools as resources with personalities and strengths. Learn their capabilities. Provide clear context and instructions.

## When to Use It

- When taking on a new management role
- When diagnosing why a team isn't performing
- When incorporating AI tools into workflows
- When restructuring team organization
- When training new managers
- When auditing your own management effectiveness
