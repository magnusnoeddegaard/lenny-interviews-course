# CEO Failure Modes

> "We take a bit of a comical approach to some of this. If we can't be playful, we can take the work seriously and not ourselves." - Jonathan Lowenhar

## What It Is

After working with hundreds of founders, Jonathan Lowenhar and his team at Enjoy The Work identified eight common CEO failure modes—patterns of behavior that derail otherwise talented founder-CEOs. These archetypes aren't black and white; most founders exhibit elements of several. The value is in recognizing your tendencies so you can counteract them.

Lowenhar enjoys presenting these on stage and "watching different founders in the audience cringe at different moments." The playful framing (Robot CEO, Angry CEO, etc.) makes it easier to discuss difficult patterns without defensiveness.

Importantly, the most common failure mode in recent years is the "Ready, Fire, Aim CEO"—founders who got used to papering over poor execution with easy capital. As capital has become harder to access, this pattern has become increasingly painful.

## How It Works

**The Eight CEO Failure Modes:**

**1. The Robot CEO**
- Believes emotion should never exist at a startup
- Forgets: "Emotions are messy, humans have emotions, startups need humans, therefore startups are messy"
- Wants urgency and passion from teams while surgically cutting "inconvenient" emotions
- Can't handle conflict or emotional situations
- *Fix*: Accept that you can't have passion without the full range of human emotion

**2. The Pleaser CEO**
- Far more concerned with being liked than running a business
- Can't tell anyone hard news or break ties
- Wants consensus on everything
- Hides and prays conflicts go away (they won't)
- *Fix*: Accept that leadership requires difficult conversations and decisive action

**3. The Perfectionist CEO**
- Far more concerned with being right than moving forward
- Creates beautiful products delivered minutes before bankruptcy
- Builds teams afraid to take bets or use intuition because CEO can't be wrong
- Doesn't understand that early-stage startups have more questions than answers
- *Fix*: Accept that circumstantial evidence is often all you have—make decisions anyway

**4. The Angry CEO**
- Wakes up angry without knowing it
- Takes out anger on employees over unrelated issues
- Apologizes later, but the damage is done
- Often modeling behavior from their own upbringing
- "No one wants to work for the angry person... the moment they see greener pastures, they're leaving"
- *Fix*: Requires genuine self-work, often with professional help

**5. The Laissez-Faire CEO**
- Believes great people don't need management
- Just hires and ignores, hoping markets take care of themselves
- Ends up with "really, really good people doing utterly disconnected things and goals are not achieved"
- "I have never met anyone that didn't benefit from good management"
- *Fix*: Accept that management is a core CEO responsibility, not optional

**6. The Ready, Fire, Aim CEO** (Most Common)
- Highly improvisational, takes lots of bets without planning
- Was rewarded for this in early stages; will cause bankruptcy at scale
- Measures outcomes after the fact, when it's too expensive
- Mistakes include: no goals, no quantification, no feedback loops
- *Fix*: Learn basic business design and planning—what are we working backwards from?

**7. The Riding the Brake CEO**
- Doesn't want to spend any money
- Driving a sports car while leaning on the brake
- Won't run out of money, but will get lapped by competitors
- Misses opportunities by over-conservatism
- *Fix*: Identify where you can take calculated bets

**8. The Riding the Gas CEO**
- Opposite of riding the brake
- Going to run out of money really fast
- Takes shots without resource planning
- Often overlaps with Ready, Fire, Aim
- *Fix*: Learn to balance acceleration with sustainability

**9. The Micromanager CEO**
- Believes they can do every job better than their employees
- "Massively disrespectful to those who work for you"
- Doesn't trust anybody—"that's actually the thing under the thing"
- Treats adults like children who need constant supervision
- Will succeed until everyone quits
- *Fix*: Distinguish between adults (who need goals and autonomy) and children (who need structure)

## How to Apply It

1. **Self-identify** - Which of these patterns do you recognize in yourself? Most founders have elements of several.

2. **Get feedback** - Ask trusted colleagues or coaches to identify which patterns they see in you.

3. **Accept coachability** - If you're not willing to accept these possibilities, you're probably not coachable.

4. **Work on one at a time** - Don't try to fix everything. Pick the most damaging pattern first.

5. **For Ready, Fire, Aim specifically:**
   - Pick your milestone (fundraise, exit, profitability)
   - Define what success looks like
   - Quantify it
   - Identify resources needed
   - Build feedback loops
   - Create accountability rituals

## When to Use It

- During executive coaching or self-reflection
- When your company is struggling and you don't know why
- When preparing for a new stage of company growth
- When noticing patterns of conflict, turnover, or missed goals
- When someone you trust says "you're being a [Robot/Pleaser/etc.]"
- During leadership offsites and development programs
