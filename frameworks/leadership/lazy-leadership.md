# Lazy Leadership (Teflon for Tasks)

> "I think they really need to lean into what I call lazy leadership, which is how do I get away from the things I hate as quickly as humanly possible? How do I be Teflon for tasks?" - Andrew Wilkinson

## What It Is

Lazy Leadership is a mindset that challenges the Protestant work ethic many entrepreneurs carry—the belief that founders must do everything themselves. Instead, it encourages leaders to rapidly delegate tasks they dislike or aren't good at, so they can focus on their highest-value contributions.

The framework reframes "laziness" as strategic delegation. Rather than wearing exhaustion as a badge of honor, effective leaders actively seek to remove themselves from tasks that don't require their unique abilities.

## How It Works

**The Protestant Work Ethic Trap:**
- Founders feel they must personally handle everything
- Exhaustion becomes a status symbol
- Leaders get stuck doing $15/hour tasks when they should do $1,000/hour work
- The business can't scale because the founder is the bottleneck

**The Lazy Leadership Mindset:**
- Identify what only you can do (your unique value)
- Delegate or automate everything else as fast as possible
- Be "Teflon" - let tasks slide off to others
- Measure success by outcomes, not hours worked

**Key insight:** At scale, you don't have to do tasks you hate. A pressure washing business owner doesn't have to pressure wash—they can focus on sales and marketing while employees do the work. A cafe owner doesn't have to make drinks—they can build the system.

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your current tasks** - List everything you do in a week

2. **Categorize by energy:**
   - Tasks that energize you (keep these)
   - Tasks that drain you (delegate these first)
   - Tasks you're uniquely good at (keep these)
   - Tasks anyone could do (delegate immediately)

3. **Calculate your true hourly rate:**
   - What's your time worth at your highest-value work?
   - Any task below that rate should be delegated when possible

4. **Set delegation targets:**
   - What tasks will you stop doing this month?
   - Who will take them over?
   - What's the minimum viable handoff?

5. **Build systems for scale:**
   - Document processes so others can execute
   - Hire for tasks you hate, not tasks you enjoy
   - Use AI and automation for repetitive work

## When to Use It

- When feeling overwhelmed by operational tasks
- When the business can't grow because you're the bottleneck
- When dreading certain aspects of the work
- When hiring and deciding what to delegate
- When evaluating whether a business will create a job you hate

## The Scale Question

Before starting a business, ask: "If this gets to scale, will I still have to do the parts I don't like?"

**Good answers:**
- "No, I can hire people to do the operations while I focus on strategy"
- "No, the software handles the repetitive parts"
- "No, at 10 leads a day I can hire operators"

**Bad answers:**
- "I'll always have to be there making coffee"
- "The business requires my hands-on expertise for every client"
- "The margins don't support hiring help"
