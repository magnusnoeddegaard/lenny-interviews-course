# Help Them Find Their Next Job

> "I will help you find your next job even if that's not at DoorDash. Life's too short to be in a job you don't like." - Keith Yandell

## What It Is

A management philosophy where you actively help your direct reports explore their next career move—including opportunities outside your company. Rather than hoping people stay, you explicitly commit to their career success wherever it leads, building deep trust and often paradoxically improving retention.

This isn't passive acknowledgment that people might leave. It's proactive engagement: forwarding recruiter emails to your reports, discussing external opportunities openly, and helping them prepare for their next role.

## How It Works

### Keith's Approach

Keith puts this commitment in his "How to Work with Keith" document and operationalizes it several ways:

**In one-on-ones**: The last 10 minutes of every one-on-one are dedicated to career development conversations. This creates recurring space for honest dialogue about aspirations.

**Forwarding opportunities**: When Keith received recruiter emails for General Counsel roles, he would forward them to Tia Sherringham, his head of legal:

> "Hey, Tia, I don't know when this job's going to be available here. I'm still liking what I'm doing. I think I'm still adding value. If you think it's time for you to leave, I think this is a really good opportunity."

**Learning from interviews**: He'd add: "You're going to learn the questions they asked during the interview process. You're going to learn what type of qualifications they're looking for. And if I'm not getting you that experience, you can tell me."

Tia stayed and eventually became General Counsel of DoorDash.

### Why It Works

**Creates transparency**: People will explore opportunities regardless. This approach brings those conversations into the open where you can participate rather than being blindsided.

**Enables succession planning**: If you know someone is considering leaving, you can plan for backfill. No more scrambling after surprise resignations.

**Builds your reputation**: When candidates do blind references on you, your former reports will say: "Keith's going to put you first." That reputation compounds over time, making recruiting easier.

**Generates loyalty**: Counterintuitively, showing you'll support someone leaving makes them want to stay. Tia stayed partly because Keith invested in her success.

**Increases boomerangs**: People who leave on good terms often return with new skills and experiences. DoorDash sees many boomerang employees.

## How to Apply It

1. **Put it in writing** - Include "I will help you find your next job" in your management principles document. Make it an explicit commitment.

2. **Dedicate time to career conversations** - Reserve the last 10 minutes of every one-on-one for career development, not just current project status.

3. **Forward relevant opportunities** - When you see roles that might interest your reports, share them. The gesture matters even if they don't pursue it.

4. **Frame external opportunities as learning** - "What did you learn from that interview process? What experience do you need that I'm not providing?"

5. **Build for the long term** - Think on a 5-10 year horizon. Today's departure is tomorrow's referral, boomerang, or advocate.

6. **Stay connected after they leave** - Maintain relationships with former reports. The network benefits everyone.

## When to Use It

- **With high performers you want to keep** - Paradoxically, the best way to retain them is showing you'll support them leaving
- **When someone seems restless** - Open the conversation before they start quietly interviewing
- **During career development discussions** - Make external paths a legitimate part of the conversation
- **When you can't promote someone** - If there's no path up internally, help them find it elsewhere

## The Economics

This feels like it costs you talent. The math actually works the other way:

**Without this approach:**
- People interview secretly
- You get surprised by resignations
- Scrambled backfill
- Relationship ends awkwardly
- No referrals from departed talent

**With this approach:**
- Honest conversations about what they want
- Advance warning of departures
- Time to hire and transition
- Strong relationship after departure
- They refer people to you and may return
