# Deductive vs Performative Culture

> "If mission, vision, values was an airline, you would not allow any family to fly on that airline. It does not arrive at most of its intended destinations. That is just a super important starting point because I'm going to kill a sacred cow here." - Evan LaPointe

## What It Is

There are two fundamentally different approaches to building company culture. Performative culture tries to inspire through artistic expression of mission, vision, and values. Deductive culture builds beliefs logically from facts about your role in the world.

Performative culture fails far more often than it succeeds because it relies on inspiration—which requires exceptional artistic ability to create. Deductive culture works reliably because it's based on logic, not inspiration.

## How It Works

### Performative Culture (What Most Companies Do)
- Create inspiring mission statement
- Write aspirational values
- Paint a compelling vision
- Hope the performance inspires people to believe

**Why it fails**:
- Success requires exceptional artistic talent
- People don't buy in unless genuinely inspired
- Inspiration is fleeting—needs constant renewal
- Creates cynicism when reality doesn't match rhetoric

### Deductive Culture (What Actually Works)

Start with facts, then deduce everything else:

**Step 1: Define Your Role**
Not "mission"—your role. Ask: Who is glad we exist? Why are they glad we exist?

This is factual, not aspirational:
- Warby Parker: People who wanted cool glasses without paying fortune prices
- AI document company: Organizations that used to transfer documents by hand
- Your company: [Who specifically benefits and why?]

**Step 2: Define Value Creation**
What specific value do you create? Time savings? Cost reduction? New capabilities? Access to markets?

**Step 3: Derive Quality Standards**
Would people be glad you exist if you shipped 2/10 quality? No. Therefore: quality standards aren't aspirational—they're logically required.

**Step 4: Define "Done"**
Not "bias to action" (hamsters have that). "Bias to impact." Work isn't done until it creates the value you're supposed to create.

**Step 5: Derive Decision-Making Principles**
Speed vs. accuracy debates? Derive the answer from your role. Sacred cows to protect? Derive from what makes people glad you exist.

**Step 6: Define Team Treatment**
What behaviors toward colleagues support your role? What undermines it? Derive the standards.

## The Logical Chain

```
Role → Value Created → Quality Required → Definition of Done → Decision Principles → Team Standards
```

Each step deduces from the previous. No inspiration required—just logic.

## How to Apply It

1. **Answer the fundamental question first**: Who is glad your company exists and why? Make this concrete and factual.

2. **Test with logic, not feeling**: When proposing any decision or behavior, ask "Does this logically support our role in the world?"

3. **Replace inspiration with implication**: Instead of inspiring people about quality, say "Our role implies this quality standard. Here's the logic."

4. **Debate principles, not values**: Principles derive from your role. Values are aspirational preferences. Stick to what can be logically defended.

5. **Use it as antibody**: When beliefs enter the organization that contradict your role (e.g., "2/10 quality is fine"), the logical framework provides the antibody.

## Example: Resolving Debates

**The question**: Should we ship fast or get it right?

**Performative answer**: "We value both speed and quality" (unhelpful)

**Deductive answer**:
- Our role: Help organizations process documents that took humans hours
- What makes them glad we exist: Accuracy saves them from manual rework
- Therefore: Accuracy is logically required; shipping inaccurate product negates our role
- Speed matters only when accuracy is preserved

The debate is resolved by logic, not inspiration.

## When to Use It

- When mission, vision, values feel hollow
- When founding a company (do this from day one)
- When culture has drifted from reality
- When teams debate without resolution
- When people ask "Why should I care?"

## The YC Wisdom

YC tells founders: "Mission, vision, values—that comes later." They're right if you're going to do it the performative way—it won't work anyway, so delay it.

But if you do it deductively, do it from day one. The logical foundation helps from the start.
