# Work Isn't War

> "They conquer the market. They capture mindshare. They target customers. They employ a sales force. They hire head hunters. They destroy the competition. They pick battles and they make a killing. That's how people talk about business. I find that to be depressing." - Jason Fried

## What It Is

Work Isn't War is a principle about rejecting the pervasive use of war metaphors in business. The language we use shapes how we think, and when business is framed as warfare—conquering, targeting, destroying, killing—it creates a mindset of aggression, zero-sum thinking, and destruction rather than creation.

This matters because language isn't neutral. When you "target" customers, you think of them differently than when you "serve" customers. When you "destroy" competition, you're focused on them instead of your own work. When you "make a killing," you're implicitly celebrating harm.

The alternative isn't to be naive about competition—it exists. But you can acknowledge competitive reality without adopting warrior language that distorts your thinking and poisons your culture.

## How It Works

**War Language** (common business speak):
- "Let's target this customer segment"
- "We need to capture market share"
- "Our sales force will deploy next quarter"
- "We're going to crush/destroy/kill the competition"
- "What's our battle plan?"
- "This is war"

**Alternative Language**:
- "Let's focus on serving this customer segment"
- "We want to grow our presence in the market"
- "Our sales team will launch next quarter"
- "We want to provide a better alternative"
- "What's our approach?"
- "This is business"

**Why It Matters**:
- War language creates a scarcity mindset
- It positions customers as targets rather than people to serve
- It defines success as destruction rather than creation
- It makes the workplace feel adversarial
- It elevates competition over craft

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your language**: Pay attention to the words you use in meetings, emails, and strategy docs. How many are war-derived?

2. **Substitute actively**: When you catch yourself using war language, stop and rephrase.

3. **Question the Navy SEAL obsession**: When someone references military tactics, ask "What context are we actually in?"

4. **Frame competition as alternative**: Instead of "beating" competitors, focus on "providing a different option."

5. **Lead by example**: If you're a leader, your language choices spread. Choose creation over destruction.

6. **Design additive goals**: "Let's make something great" rather than "Let's beat them."

## When to Use It

- Setting company culture and values
- Writing strategy documents
- Coaching teams on mindset
- When competitive anxiety is creating unhealthy culture
- Building a creative, craft-focused environment
