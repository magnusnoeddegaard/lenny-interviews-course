# Sacred Cows as Roadmap

> "The sacred cows are their own roadmap. What are all the things that you think we're not allowed to change? Let's start there." - Kayvon Beykpour

## What It Is

Sacred Cows as Roadmap is a counterintuitive approach to driving product innovation within established organizations. Instead of working around organizational taboos and long-standing assumptions, you actively identify them and make them the first targets for change.

In calcified organizations, there are always features, approaches, or principles that "everyone knows" cannot be touched. These become self-reinforcing constraints that limit creative thinking. By deliberately cataloging these untouchables and questioning why they're off-limits, you create a natural prioritization of the highest-leverage changes—often the ones with the biggest impact precisely because no one has dared to address them.

At Twitter, examples of sacred cows included: the reverse-chronological timeline, the 140-character limit, not allowing users to control their reply space, and not annotating tweets with community context.

## How It Works

**The Inversion Principle**: The things an organization protects most fiercely are often the things most ripe for innovation. They've been protected so long that assumptions about them have never been tested.

**Why It Works**:
1. **Compressed discovery** - You skip the brainstorming phase because constraints are already identified
2. **Higher leverage** - Sacred cows are usually high-impact features/behaviors precisely because they're so foundational
3. **Cultural signal** - Successfully changing a sacred cow sends a powerful message that anything is possible
4. **Fresh perspective** - New leaders and outsiders often see sacred cows more clearly than insiders

**The Categories**: At any company, sacred cows fall into:
- **Product features** - "We can't change the feed algorithm"
- **Technical constraints** - "We can't refactor that system"
- **Cultural norms** - "We don't ship things that fast"
- **Business model assumptions** - "Users won't pay for that"

## How to Apply It

1. **Catalog your sacred cows** - Ask the team: "What are all the things we think we're not allowed to change?" Write them down explicitly.

2. **Investigate the origins** - For each sacred cow, understand why it became protected. Was it a conscious decision or gradual calcification? Is the original reason still valid?

3. **Stress-test the assumption** - Ask: "If we were starting fresh today, would we make this same choice?" If not, it's a candidate for change.

4. **Start with the smallest sacred cow** - Build momentum by successfully changing something the organization thought was untouchable. This creates permission for larger changes.

5. **Use acquisition as disruption** - Bring in founders or outside leaders who don't share the same assumptions and give them license to challenge sacred cows.

6. **Celebrate the change** - When you successfully address a sacred cow, make it visible. It signals that the organization is evolving.

## When to Use It

- When joining a new organization as a product leader
- When an organization feels "stuck" and unable to innovate
- When competitors are moving faster despite your advantages
- When customer feedback consistently points to the same limitations
- When the stated strategy is "refine the core" for too long
