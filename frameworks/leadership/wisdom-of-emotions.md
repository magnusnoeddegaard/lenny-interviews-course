# Wisdom of Emotions

> "There's wisdom in emotion... Fear is something wants to be paid attention to. Sadness is something wants to be let go of. Anger is something is not of service to me or my people. Joy is something that wants to be celebrated. Creative energy is something wants to be born into the world." - JM Nickels

## What It Is

The Wisdom of Emotions framework challenges the common belief that emotions have no place in the workplace. Instead of viewing emotions as irrational disturbances to be suppressed, this framework recognizes each emotion as carrying a specific, useful message.

JM Nickels calls this "whole body intelligence"—using not just head/logic/data, but also heart and gut. Emotions are "energy moving in the body," often correlated with thoughts, and they contain signal that can inform better decisions.

The key insight is that different emotions are pointing to different types of situations requiring different types of action. By learning to decode the message each emotion carries, you can use emotional awareness as a form of intelligence.

## How It Works

**Fear: Something wants to be paid attention to**
- A signal that there's a potential threat or risk worth examining
- Not always accurate (saber-toothed tiger vs. disapproving executive)
- But sometimes pointing to legitimate concerns (safety edge cases, overlooked risks)

**Sadness: Something wants to be let go of**
- A mourning process for something that will no longer be
- Could be a vision, a relationship, an expectation, a plan
- The invitation is to grieve and release rather than cling

**Anger: Something is not of service**
- A signal that something isn't serving you, your team, or your mission
- Often indicates a need to change something or set a boundary
- Contains energy for action and transformation

**Joy: Something wants to be celebrated**
- A signal to pause and appreciate success
- Often rushed past in pursuit of the next goal
- Celebrating reinforces positive behaviors and builds morale

**Creative Energy: Something wants to be born**
- A signal that a new idea, vision, or creation is emerging
- The invitation is to give it space and attention
- Often felt as excitement, aliveness, inspiration

## How to Apply It

1. **Develop body awareness** - Notice where you feel different emotions in your body. Fear might be chest pressure, sadness a sinking stomach, anger a tight jaw. Learn your personal signatures.

2. **Pause when emotions arise** - Instead of reacting immediately or suppressing, take a moment to identify what you're feeling.

3. **Ask "what's the message?"** - Use the framework to decode what the emotion is pointing to:
   - Fear → What needs attention?
   - Sadness → What needs letting go?
   - Anger → What needs to change?
   - Joy → What deserves celebration?
   - Creative energy → What wants to emerge?

4. **Take appropriate action** - Respond to the underlying message rather than the surface emotion.

5. **Practice voicing emotions** - If appropriate, name the emotion in meetings: "I notice I feel fear around this." This shifts the dynamic and invites authentic conversation.

## When to Use It

- In meetings when emotions are running high but nobody is acknowledging them
- When you notice strong reactions in yourself during reviews or feedback
- When something feels "off" but you can't articulate why (often an emotional signal)
- When you're moving too fast from goal to goal without celebrating wins
- When creative ideas keep surfacing but get suppressed
- During one-on-ones when team members seem emotionally activated
