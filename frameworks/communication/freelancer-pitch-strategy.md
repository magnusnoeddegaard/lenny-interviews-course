# Freelancer Pitch Strategy

> "My wife, as a freelancer, on a day-to-day basis is hungrier for stories than me because Jen has to hustle for her food. Jen has to find stories and pitch those stories to editors at publications, and that's when she gets paid." - Jason Feifer

## What It Is

When pitching media, target freelance writers instead of (or in addition to) staff editors. Freelancers are more likely to read your pitch, respond to it, and pursue it—because their livelihood depends on finding good stories.

Staff editors at major publications receive hundreds of pitches daily and are salaried regardless of whether they respond to yours. Freelancers actively need stories to earn their income.

## How It Works

**The fundamental difference:**

| Staff Editor | Freelancer |
|--------------|------------|
| Salaried employee | Paid per story |
| Flooded with pitches | Gets fewer pitches |
| Can ignore you | Needs story ideas |
| Not actively hunting | Constantly hustling |
| Job is editing/managing | Job is finding + writing |

**Why freelancers respond:**

1. **Economic incentive:** They literally get paid when they find and write stories
2. **Lower volume:** They're not receiving 30-50 pitches per day like editors-in-chief
3. **Active hunting:** Good freelancers are constantly looking for stories—you're helping them
4. **Higher read rate:** Near 100% chance they'll read a relevant email

**Jason's observation about his wife Jen Miller (NYT, Washington Post, Guardian freelancer):**

"If somebody reads a story that she wrote and says, 'Ah, I think I have an idea of what this person is interested in,' and then tracks her email address down and then emails her, Jen is getting a lot fewer pitches than me, the chances of her reading it are close to a hundred percent."

## How to Apply It

1. **Find the bylines:** Read articles in your target publication. Look at who wrote them.

2. **Identify freelancers:** Click on the author's name or bio. Look for:
   - No "Staff Writer" or "Editor" title
   - Bio says "Contributor" or just "[Name] is a writer in [City]"
   - They have a personal portfolio website
   - They write for multiple publications

3. **Verify and research:** Google their name to find their portfolio site. See what topics they cover and which outlets they write for.

4. **Pitch appropriately:** Remember that a freelancer who writes for Publication X can only sell stories that fit Publication X's mission—frame your pitch accordingly.

5. **Build relationships:** Freelancers who like you become ongoing sources of coverage across multiple outlets they write for.

## Finding Contact Information

- **Portfolio websites:** Most freelancers have personal sites with contact forms or email addresses
- **Twitter/X bios:** Often include contact info or links
- **LinkedIn:** Professional profiles with contact options
- **Author pages:** Some publications list email addresses

## Important Caveats

- **Still customize your pitch:** Freelancers aren't desperate—they need stories that fit their outlets
- **Understand their publications:** A freelancer pitching to NYT still needs NYT-worthy stories
- **Respect their expertise:** They know what will sell better than you do
- **Be patient:** They may pitch your story to an editor who says no

## The Ripple Effect

When you build a relationship with a freelancer:
- They might cover you for multiple outlets
- They'll remember you for future trend pieces
- They become part of your press network
- They might introduce you to other writers
