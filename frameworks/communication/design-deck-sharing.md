# Design Deck Sharing

> "What we do is having people within the design team share as a screenshot or a prototype of what they're working on in a shared deck... We get to see what's happening across the design team. And this is really important for all the designers because they could see... what is happening, and they can say, 'Oh my gosh, you're working on that surface, so am I. Let's talk about it.'" - Katie Dill

## What It Is

Design Deck Sharing is a simple but powerful practice: designers add screenshots or prototypes of their current work to a shared Google Slides deck at a regular cadence (monthly or biweekly). The deck is shared across the design team and with product, engineering, and company leadership.

This practice reduces interference (wasted work, misalignment, redundancy) by making work visible before it's finished. It's not a status check—it's about awareness and connection.

The key insight is that work-in-progress visibility prevents two teams from building the same thing, helps teams spot related patterns they can share, and gives leadership visibility into what's actually being built.

## How It Works

**What to share:**
- Screenshots of designs in progress
- Prototypes of key interactions
- Medium and large projects (skip small tasks to keep the deck manageable)

**How often:**
- Monthly works well for large teams
- Biweekly for smaller teams or faster-moving projects
- Experiment and adjust based on what feels sustainable

**Who sees it:**
- All designers (primary audience)
- Product managers and engineering leads
- Company leadership

**Keep it low maintenance:**
- Use Google Slides (everyone can access, easy to share)
- Simple screenshots, not polished presentations
- Make adding to the deck quick and easy

## How to Apply It

1. **Create a shared deck** - Start a Google Slides deck that anyone on the design team can add to.

2. **Set a regular cadence** - Monthly is a good starting point. Send a reminder when it's time to add work.

3. **Make it about awareness, not status** - This isn't to track productivity. It's to prevent redundancy and spark collaboration.

4. **Share beyond design** - Send the deck to PMs, engineers, and leaders. A picture tells a thousand words.

5. **Open the curtain on work-in-progress** - Showing unfinished work feels vulnerable, but finding conflicts early saves time.

6. **Keep it sustainable** - If it feels like a chore, reduce frequency or scope. The deck should feel valuable, not burdensome.

## When to Use It

- When teams work in parallel on different parts of the product
- When there's no shared visibility into what's being built
- When redundant work is being created
- When leadership wants to understand what's happening across product areas
- When onboarding new team members who need context
- As companies scale and informal awareness breaks down
