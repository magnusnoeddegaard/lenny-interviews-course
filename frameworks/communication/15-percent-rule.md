# 15% Rule

> "Step a little bit outside your comfort zone. If you step a little bit outside your comfort zone, you're very unlikely to freak yourself or the other person out. But you'll know, you'll feel it a little bit, you'll be like, okay, I feel just a little uncomfortable saying this, but I think I'm going to try." - Carole Robin

## What It Is

The 15% Rule is a framework for gradually building deeper relationships through incremental disclosure and vulnerability. It addresses the common challenge of wanting to connect more deeply with others while being afraid of going too far and creating discomfort.

The model uses concentric circles: at the center is your comfort zone (things you share without thinking), at the outer edge is your danger zone (things you'd never share), and in between is the learning zone—where growth and relationship-building happen.

Most people believe they have to choose between staying safe (comfort zone) or taking a huge risk (danger zone). The 15% Rule reveals a third option: step just slightly outside your comfort zone, observe the response, and then settle into a new, expanded comfort zone before taking another small step.

## How It Works

**The Three Zones:**
1. **Comfort Zone** - What you share without hesitation; automatic disclosures
2. **Learning Zone** (Zone of Proximal Development) - Slightly uncomfortable but manageable; where growth happens
3. **Danger Zone** - Would overwhelm you or the other person; creates damage rather than connection

**The 15% Principle:**
- Step just 15% outside your current comfort zone
- Notice how it feels—slight discomfort means you're in the right zone
- Observe how the other person responds
- If they reciprocate, you've established a new, larger comfort zone together
- Repeat from this new baseline

## How to Apply It

1. **Notice your current comfort zone** - What do you share automatically? What topics do you avoid entirely?

2. **Identify the 15% edge** - Ask yourself: "What's something slightly uncomfortable I could share or ask?" It should feel a bit risky but not terrifying.

3. **Take the small step** - Share the disclosure or ask the question. Watch for the physical sensation of slight discomfort—that's your signal you're in the learning zone.

4. **Observe the response** - Did the other person reciprocate? Did they lean in or pull back? Use this data to calibrate your next move.

5. **Establish the new baseline** - If the exchange went well, you now have a larger shared comfort zone to build from.

6. **Iterate** - From your new baseline, find the next 15% edge and repeat.

## When to Use It

- Building trust with a new team member or colleague
- Deepening an existing professional relationship
- Having difficult conversations (use 15% steps to gradually address hard topics)
- Giving feedback (start with smaller disclosures before larger ones)
- Leadership situations where appropriate vulnerability builds followership
- Any relationship you want to move from "functional" toward "exceptional"
