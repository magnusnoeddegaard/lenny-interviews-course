# Magic Questions (Is That Right?)

> "The thing about magic questions is they're not actually questions, they're statements and they end with 'Do you agree?' or 'Is that right?' I have found this the most helpful way for trying to understand a person's mental model—to just put facts in front of them and see what they say no to and what they say yes to." - Hilary Gridley

## What It Is

When you're trying to understand how someone thinks—whether it's a CEO, a stakeholder, a legal team, or a direct report—open-ended questions often fail. People struggle to articulate their mental models, especially if they're working from intuition, confidential information, or years of accumulated judgment.

Magic Questions flip the approach: instead of asking someone to explain their thinking, you make assertions and ask them to confirm, deny, or refine. This surfaces their mental model much faster than waiting for them to articulate it themselves.

The format is simple:
```
[Statement of what you believe to be true] + "Is that right?" / "Do you agree?"
```

## How It Works

**Why open-ended questions often fail:**

- The person may not be a good communicator
- The answer may not be straightforward
- They may be working from intuition they can't articulate
- There may be confidential context they can't share
- They don't know where to start

**Why assertions work better:**

- It's easier to react than to generate
- "No, that's not quite right" surfaces information "tell me what you think" doesn't
- You're actively testing hypotheses instead of passively waiting
- It shows you've done your homework
- It forces you to make your mental model explicit

## How to Apply It

**The basic pattern:**

Instead of: "What do you think about this approach?"
Try: "I think this approach makes sense because X and Y. Is that right?"

Instead of: "What should I do differently?"
Try: "I think I could have done A instead of B. Do you agree?"

Instead of: "Is this compliant?"
Try: "If we structure it like X, that should be okay because of Y. Is that right?"

**Example: Working with legal/compliance teams**

Hilary describes working in regulated spaces where the answer is often "it depends." Early in her career, she found this frustrating—she wanted clear rules.

Instead of asking: "Can we do this?"
She learned to ask: "What if we did X, Y, and Z? What if this is what the copy said? Would that be okay?"

Response: "No" or "Yes"
Follow-up: "Why?"

By making specific proposals and getting yes/no reactions, she could "tease out the mental model rather than asking them to explain it."

**Example: Coaching direct reports**

When team members ask open-ended questions like "What should I have done differently?", redirect:

> "Rephrase that as: 'Tell me what you think you could have done differently.' Then ask me if I agree."

This approach:
1. Forces them to develop their own judgment
2. Calibrates their thinking against yours over time
3. Prevents dependency on you for answers

**The right mindset:**

This technique can feel manipulative if done wrong. The key is genuine curiosity:

> "You've got to go in pure of heart. You've got to go in open to being wrong and even expecting to be wrong. If you're coming in and you're like, 'Here's what I think. You agree? You agree?' Of course you're not getting the answer you want."

Approach with: "Help me understand how I'm wrong. Help me understand what I'm getting wrong here."

## When to Use It

- Understanding how executives or stakeholders think
- Working with legal, compliance, or other specialized functions
- Navigating ambiguous or "it depends" situations
- Coaching team members to develop judgment
- Any situation where open-ended questions aren't getting useful answers

## What to Watch For

- **Don't be coercive** - If you're trying to get to "yes," you'll get bad information
- **Signal openness** - Make it clear you expect to be wrong and want to learn
- **Follow up on "no"** - The explanation of why you're wrong is where the insight lives
- **Use with care one-on-one** - In front of groups, this can feel like putting someone on the spot
