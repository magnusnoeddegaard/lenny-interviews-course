# Press Purpose Test

> "Think about press the same way that you think about raising money, which is to say you do it when you know what the money is for, and you should do it when you know what the press is for." - Jason Feifer

## What It Is

A qualifying question to ask before pursuing media coverage: What do I need press for?

Just as you shouldn't raise money without knowing how you'll use it, you shouldn't chase press without a clear tactical purpose. Many entrepreneurs pursue press because they feel they "deserve" recognition for their hard work, but that's not a strategic reason—it's an emotional one.

The Press Purpose Test forces you to articulate the specific outcome you're seeking before investing time and resources in media outreach.

## How It Works

Press can serve several legitimate tactical purposes:

**Growth-focused purposes:**
- Drive awareness to a new product launch
- Reach into a new customer segment or geography
- Acquire customers (though this is unpredictable)

**Credibility-focused purposes:**
- Provide validation when raising money ("articles to show the marketplace takes you seriously")
- Enable "As Seen In" badges on your website
- Position your company differently in your marketplace
- Establish executives as thought leaders for conference invitations

**Relationship-focused purposes:**
- Get in front of potential partners or investors
- Attract talent who discover you through coverage

The key insight: If your answer to "What is this press for?" is vague ("awareness") or emotional ("I deserve it"), you're probably not ready. A good answer is specific and tied to a business outcome.

## How to Apply It

1. **Before any outreach, ask:** "What specifically do I need this press for?"

2. **Test for specificity:** Can you complete this sentence? "If I get this coverage, it will enable me to _____ which will result in _____"

3. **Match publication to purpose:**
   - Customer acquisition? Target publications your customers read
   - Investor credibility? Target publications investors respect
   - Thought leadership? Target publications in your professional community

4. **Evaluate readiness:** Are you at a stage where you can actually capitalize on the coverage? A lot of people reach out too early—before they can convert attention into anything meaningful.

5. **Consider alternatives:** Would your purpose be better served by paid marketing, content marketing, or building in public?

## When to Use It

- **Before hiring PR** - Make sure you have a purpose that justifies the cost
- **Before cold outreach** - Don't waste journalists' time without a clear reason
- **At early stage** - Question whether press is premature
- **During strategy planning** - Ensure press efforts align with business objectives
- **When feeling FOMO** - Check if you're pursuing press for the right reasons

## What to Avoid

- **"I deserve this"** - Recognition for hard work isn't a tactical purpose
- **Vanity metrics** - Being featured isn't success if it doesn't advance your goals
- **Wrong publication fit** - A local hot dog business doesn't need national coverage
- **Too early** - If you can't capitalize on attention, wait
