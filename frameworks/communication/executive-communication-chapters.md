# Executive Communication (Chapter Method)

> "Whatever you're working on, you're basically writing and telling a story. And when you talk to an exec about that story, you have to start with chapter one... many times when non-executives are presenting to execs, they'll start on like chapter six, so even if that part of the story is right, you haven't earned the right to tell that part of the story yet because you skipped the first five chapters." - Casey Winters

## What It Is

A framework for structuring upward communication to executives. The core insight is that communicating with executives is like telling a story: you need to start at the right chapter—not too early (wasting time on what's obvious) and not too late (assuming context they don't have).

Most people either start on "chapter six" (jumping into details without context) or "at the beginning of time" (spending 20 minutes on things everyone already knows). The goal is to find the middle: start at the last point that would be completely obvious to your audience, then progress to new information they can follow.

## How It Works

### The Two Common Mistakes

**Starting at Chapter Six:**
- Jumping straight into tactical details
- Assuming executives have context they don't have
- Making it impossible for leadership to evaluate fairly
- Forces executives to ask basic questions, undermining confidence

**Starting at the Beginning of Time:**
- Re-explaining company strategy everyone knows
- Spending 20 minutes before getting to new information
- Running out of time before the actual content
- Testing patience instead of building credibility

### The Right Approach

Find the last point that would be completely obvious to the person you're presenting to, then start there:

1. **Chapter One**: What part of company strategy are you working on?
2. **Chapter Two**: What metrics are you trying to improve?
3. **Chapter Three**: What assumptions guide your work?
4. **Chapter Four**: What you're proposing
5. **Chapter Five**: Expected outcomes and trade-offs
6. **Chapter Six**: Detailed implementation

### Executive Communication is Executives Communication

Different executives have different styles and concerns. You need to:
- Anticipate what each executive will care about
- Role-play their likely questions before the meeting
- Have pre-meetings with key individuals when possible
- Customize your story for your specific audience

## How to Apply It

### Before a Big Presentation

1. **Role-play the audience** - Have your manager or a peer pretend to be each executive in the room
2. **Anticipate questions** - List every possible question that could be asked
3. **Prepare data answers** - Know the data answers cold; not knowing casts doubt on everything
4. **Have pre-meetings** - De-risk by getting concerns surfaced before the big meeting

### Structure Your Presentation

1. **Start with context** - What company priority does this relate to?
2. **State the metric** - What are you trying to move?
3. **Share assumptions** - What beliefs guide your approach?
4. **Present recommendations** - Lead with what you propose (see: Dinosaur Brain Reviews)
5. **Show trade-offs explicitly** - What are you *not* doing and why?

### Communicate Trade-Offs Upward

- Don't try to handle everything yourself; escalate constraints
- If circumstances are dire, tell leadership so they can help change circumstances
- If they can't change circumstances, at least they can evaluate fairly
- Executives can't help if they don't know what's really happening

## When to Use It

- Product reviews with leadership
- Board meeting presentations
- Cross-functional strategy meetings
- Any high-stakes presentation to executives
- Requesting resources or support for initiatives
