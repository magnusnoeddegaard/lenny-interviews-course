# Spirit of What They're Trying to Achieve

> "The biggest tip I would have for people in this situation is really understand whether it's the founder or your manager or whoever it is, what is it that they're trying to accomplish for the user and for the business? Remind them of that, get aligned on that. And then come back with better options." - Jiaona Zhang

## What It Is

Spirit of What They're Trying to Achieve is a framework for effectively pushing back on ideas (especially from leaders) by first deeply understanding the underlying goal, then proposing better alternatives. The key insight is that most disagreements aren't about the ultimate objective—they're about the proposed approach to achieve it.

By separating the "what we're trying to accomplish" from the "how we're proposing to do it," you can align on the goal while redirecting toward a more effective solution. This prevents the conversation from becoming adversarial and positions you as a partner in problem-solving rather than an obstacle.

JZ developed this framework through her experience at Airbnb, particularly when navigating situations where founders were deeply committed to specific solutions (like Airbnb Plus) that weren't working.

## How It Works

**The Three-Step Process:**

1. **Understand the spirit** - What user problem or business outcome is the person really trying to achieve? Look past the specific proposal to the underlying intent.

2. **Align on the goal** - Explicitly confirm: "I understand we're trying to achieve X for our users and Y for the business. Is that right?" Get agreement on the destination.

3. **Propose better options** - Once aligned on the goal, present alternative approaches that achieve the same spirit through more effective means.

**Why This Works:**

- Smart people ultimately want to do the right thing for users and the business
- When you show you understand and share their goal, you become an ally
- Presenting alternatives shifts from "no" to "yes, and here's how"
- Data and thinking behind your alternative makes it hard to refuse

**The Trap to Avoid:**

Don't just say "This is a bad idea" or "This won't work." That positions you as an opponent. Instead, validate the goal while redirecting the approach.

## Example: Airbnb Plus

**The Situation:**
- Airbnb was investing heavily in Airbnb Plus (inspecting and managing inventory)
- JZ and her team saw it wasn't working—unit economics didn't scale
- Brian Chesky was committed to the approach

**The Spirit:**
- Users wanted to know what they were getting themselves into
- New guests didn't trust the quality of Airbnb listings
- The company wanted to expand beyond early adopters who were comfortable with uncertainty

**The Reframe:**
Instead of "Airbnb Plus won't work," JZ focused on:
- "The goal is helping people trust what they're booking"
- "Inspectors are one way, but reviews and better representation are more scalable"
- "I'm going to work on the review system—that achieves the same spirit through technology"

**The Alternatives Proposed:**
- Improve the review system (free signal vs. expensive inspectors)
- Better representation of homes through photos and descriptions
- Targeted solutions for specific problems (lockboxes for entry issues, cleaning partnerships)

## How to Apply It

1. **Listen deeply first** - Don't immediately form a counter-argument. Understand why they're proposing this approach.

2. **Ask clarifying questions** - "What user problem are we solving?" "What would success look like?" "Why is this important now?"

3. **Articulate the spirit back** - "So if I understand correctly, we're trying to [goal] because [reason]."

4. **Get explicit alignment** - Wait for confirmation before proceeding. This is crucial.

5. **Present alternatives with rationale** - "Given that goal, here are some approaches. Option A does X through Y. Option B..."

6. **Support with data** - Show why your alternative is more likely to achieve the shared goal.

7. **Be willing to be wrong** - Sometimes their approach IS the right one. Stay open.

## When to Use It

- **Founder/exec is committed to an approach you think is wrong** - Most valuable here
- **Stakeholder requests a specific solution** - Look for the underlying need
- **Cross-functional disagreements** - Find the shared goal beneath the conflict
- **Customer requests a feature** - Understand the job to be done, not just the feature
- **Code/design reviews** - Why did they make this choice? What were they trying to achieve?

## The Conviction Check

JZ notes that before pushing back, you need to assess your own conviction:

- **High conviction this is wrong:** Your job is to push back, or you're not doing your job
- **Still learning:** Gather more information before taking a strong stance

If you have high conviction, not speaking up is a failure of leadership.
