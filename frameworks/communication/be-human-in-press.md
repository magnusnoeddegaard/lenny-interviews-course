# Be Human in Press

> "Be human, be human. Press releases don't work because they're not human. I don't like interviewing people who are on talking points because that's not human. You're ultimately engaging in a human business." - Jason Feifer

## What It Is

A principle for all press interactions: strip away the corporate polish and engage as one human being to another. The media industry is fundamentally about humans making subjective decisions to serve other humans—and the more human you are at every step, the better your outcomes.

This applies to pitching, interviewing, and the actual story that gets written about you.

## How It Works

**Why it matters:**

Media decisions are subjective. There's no algorithm, no right answer. An editor decides whether to pursue your story based on how it feels to engage with you. A writer decides how to frame your story based on who they perceive you to be.

**Press releases fail** because they're corporate speak, not human communication. They signal "this is a mass blast" rather than "I'm a human reaching out to you specifically."

**Talking points backfire** because journalists can tell when someone is performing versus thinking. It makes them suspicious and less likely to write positively.

**Human engagement succeeds** because:
1. It demonstrates authenticity and builds trust
2. It differentiates you from the flood of polished pitches
3. It creates a connection that makes the journalist want to help
4. It leads to more interesting, genuine stories

## How to Apply It

**In your pitch:**

- Write like you're emailing a real person, not filing a press release
- Reference something specific about their work (genuinely, not fake)
- Share the interesting human story, not the marketing narrative
- Be direct about what you're hoping for

**In the interview:**

- Be open about challenges, not just successes
- Think out loud when asked something you haven't considered
- Show vulnerability where appropriate
- Don't try to control the narrative—engage with the questions honestly

**What not to do:**

- Don't fake familiarity with their work
- Don't give rehearsed answers to every question
- Don't be cagey or controlling about information
- Don't treat the journalist as a service provider

## The Lenny Example

Jason told Lenny directly:

"The reason why that Fast Company reporter liked you, I am very sure, was because when they got on the phone with you, you were just like a normal nice guy. If you presented yourself differently because you just wanted to frame yourself in some way or you felt protective, the reporter would've thought 'This guy is a dick,' and he would've written a totally different story."

Being human directly shaped the coverage outcome.

## When to Use It

- **Every email pitch** - Write human, not corporate
- **Every interview** - Be yourself, not your talking points
- **Every follow-up** - Maintain the human connection
- **Crisis moments** - Authenticity matters most when things go wrong

## The Risk of Over-Control

"The more you try to control it, the more the reporter is going to be annoyed at you. And the more, in fact, the reporter might try to take a shot at you in the story as a result. Because they found you too controlling, because they felt like you had something to hide."

Trying to manage every aspect signals distrust and creates adversarial dynamics.
