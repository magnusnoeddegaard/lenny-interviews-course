# Theory Interview Technique

> "My favorite strategy for interviewing people is to throw a theory at them... 'I want to run a theory by you. Do you think that the reason why you are really interested in this is actually because of this other thing that you told me?' It forces people to think in real time in front of you." - Jason Feifer

## What It Is

An interviewing technique where you synthesize what someone has said into a theory or hypothesis, then present it back to them for reaction. This forces genuine, unrehearsed thinking—especially valuable when interviewing people who have polished answers to standard questions.

The technique demonstrates deep listening and creates moments of authentic reflection, leading to more interesting and honest responses.

## How It Works

**The standard problem:**

When you interview someone who's been interviewed many times (celebrities, executives, repeat founders), they have pre-packaged answers. You get their talking points, not their thinking.

**The solution:**

About 10 minutes into the conversation, after they've shared several things:

1. **Actively listen** for patterns, contradictions, or connections across different things they've said
2. **Synthesize** these into a theory: "I noticed you mentioned X earlier, and now you're talking about Y..."
3. **Present it as a hypothesis:** "I want to run a theory by you. Do you think that the reason you [did X] is actually because of [Y]?"
4. **Observe their real-time processing**

**Why it works:**

- Shows you're genuinely listening (not just running through questions)
- Asks something they've never been asked before
- Requires them to think, not recite
- Creates a collaborative, respectful dynamic
- Gets past rehearsed narratives to actual insight

## How to Apply It

**In interviews:**

1. Take notes on key themes, emotions, and decisions they mention
2. Look for connections they haven't made explicitly
3. Wait for the right moment (usually 10-15 minutes in)
4. Frame it genuinely: "This is just a theory, but..." or "I'm curious about something..."
5. Present your synthesis and ask for their reaction

**Example prompts:**

- "I want to run a theory by you. Earlier you mentioned [X], and now you're describing [Y]. Do you think those are connected?"
- "It strikes me that both of those decisions came from [underlying pattern]. Is that fair, or am I reading too much into it?"
- "I'm noticing a theme here. When [situation], you tend to [response]. What's behind that?"

**In hiring:**

Jason mentions Adam Moss's approach at New York Magazine: drilling down on specifics to see how candidates think.

"What's your favorite section?" → "What would be a good neighborhood to feature?" → "What would be three good elements of that?"

The value isn't the right answer—it's observing how they think under pressure.

## When to Use It

- **Interviewing executives/founders** who have polished talking points
- **Hiring conversations** to see how candidates think, not just what they know
- **User research** to uncover deeper motivations
- **One-on-ones** to help reports develop self-awareness
- **Networking conversations** to have more meaningful exchanges

## Tips for Execution

- **Be genuine:** Don't fake a theory—it should come from real curiosity
- **Make it collaborative:** You're not testing them; you're thinking together
- **Be willing to be wrong:** "Maybe I'm off base, but..." invites honest correction
- **Follow the thread:** Their response often opens new directions
- **Practice active listening:** This only works if you're truly paying attention
