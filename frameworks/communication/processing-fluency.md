# Processing Fluency

> "Our brains are a little bit on the lazy side. We don't like complex things. And so, we really strive to make all of our solutions relatively easy for the brain to process." - David Placek

## What It Is

Processing Fluency is a cognitive science principle applied to naming: names that the brain can process quickly and easily create positive associations and attract attention. Names that require cognitive effort create resistance and are more likely to be ignored.

This isn't about simplicity or descriptiveness - it's about how well-constructed the name is for rapid mental processing. An invented name like Vercel can have perfect fluency while a descriptive name can be clunky.

## How It Works

**The Cognitive Reality**

The brain processes millions of signals daily. To cope, it takes shortcuts:
- Easy-to-process information gets attention
- Difficult-to-process information gets filtered out
- This is automatic and unconscious

**What Creates High Fluency**

1. **Familiar building blocks** - Using known word units even in invented names
   - Vercel: "ver" (as in vino veritas, verde) + "cel" (as in accelerate)
   - Both parts feel familiar even though the combination is new

2. **Balanced structure** - Combining different elements well
   - Strong opening sounds for attention
   - Smooth endings for easy flow
   - Not all noise, not all soft

3. **Compound clarity** - Two-word names that parse easily
   - Blackberry: Two familiar words, instant mental images
   - Windsurf: Clear components, clear associations
   - Compare to technical jargon that requires unpacking

**What Creates Low Fluency**

- Unusual letter combinations that don't parse naturally
- Names that require explanation to pronounce
- Complex technical terminology
- Multiple syllables without clear structure
- Foreign language elements with no English equivalent

## How to Apply It

1. **Test instant pronunciation**
   - Show the name to someone for 2 seconds
   - Can they pronounce it correctly immediately?
   - If not, fluency is low

2. **Check for familiar components**
   - Does the name use known prefixes, suffixes, or word roots?
   - Even invented names can use familiar building blocks
   - "Vercel" works because "ver" and "cel" are both recognizable

3. **Evaluate compound names for clarity**
   - Can each component be parsed instantly?
   - Do the parts create clear mental images?
   - 1+1 should equal 3 (associations multiply)

4. **Balance complexity and interest**
   - Too simple = forgettable
   - Too complex = filtered out
   - Sweet spot: Novel enough to be distinctive, simple enough to process

5. **Test the walkaway test**
   - Say the name once to someone
   - Ask them to recall it 30 minutes later
   - High fluency names stick; low fluency names fade

## When to Use It

- When generating name candidates
- When evaluating a shortlist for final selection
- When an invented name "feels wrong" but you're not sure why
- When choosing between similar options
- When presenting to non-native English speakers (fluency transcends language)
