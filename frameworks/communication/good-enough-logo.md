# Good Enough Logo

> "What I love about the work that I do is that I understand that a lot of people have to just have something to put on decks and have something to put on a holding page or whatever, and internal teams are totally capable of doing that early work. But then if it does become successful, you don't want to get locked into whatever it is that you had to throw together before an investor meeting or something." - Jessica Hische

## What It Is

The Good Enough Logo philosophy is a contrarian take on branding from a professional designer's perspective. It argues that early-stage companies should not over-invest in elaborate brand explorations when their business model isn't yet validated. A basic, functional logo is sufficient until the company has proven product-market fit and achieved some level of success.

This approach recognizes that startups often need to pivot, and heavy early investment in branding can mean throwing away money if the business direction changes. The logo and brand should evolve alongside the business, with significant investment coming only after the company has found its footing.

## How It Works

**Early Stage (Pre-validation):**
- Use internal resources to create a functional logo
- Focus on something that works on decks, landing pages, and basic marketing
- Prioritize hiring and product development over brand investment

**Trigger Points for Refresh:**
1. **Scaling physical assets** - About to print swag, host a conference, or invest in physical brand materials
2. **Product expansion** - Moving from beta to a major new version of the product
3. **Competitive pressure** - Success attracts copycats who can easily replicate free/common fonts
4. **Utilitarian problems** - Logo doesn't scale well, lacks an avatar version, has legibility issues

**Investment Timing:**
- Don't spend half your seed funding on branding
- Wait until the product direction is stable
- Bring in professionals when you're ready to "grow it up" without losing what made it work

## How to Apply It

1. **Accept "good enough"** - Your spouse, co-founder, or internal team can create the first version
2. **Focus on function** - The logo needs to work on a deck, a website, and maybe a business card
3. **Track pain points** - Note when the logo causes actual problems (scaling issues, misreads, competitive copying)
4. **Time the investment** - Refresh when you're about to make significant physical investments in the brand
5. **Preserve the vibe** - When refreshing, keep what works while fixing what doesn't

## When to Use It

- When bootstrapping or in early fundraising stages
- When the business model might still pivot
- When choosing between brand investment vs. hiring/product investment
- When internal resources can produce something functional

## When NOT to Use It

- When brand IS the entire value proposition (some consumer products)
- When operating in a space where visual identity is critical from day one
- When you have significant budget specifically allocated for brand
