# Art of Inquiry

> "The root of the word inquiry is quest. Quest means to be in search of and not knowing what you're going to find, not the way most people think about questions and inquiries. Most of the time people ask a question to confirm a hypothesis." - Carole Robin

## What It Is

The Art of Inquiry is a discipline for asking questions that genuinely explore rather than confirm what you already believe. True inquiry comes from curiosity—being "in search of" something you don't yet know—rather than from a desire to prove yourself right or lead someone to a predetermined conclusion.

Most questions people ask aren't really questions at all. They're judgments disguised as questions ("Don't you think you'd be better off letting that go?"), hypotheses seeking confirmation ("You're just trying to discredit John, aren't you?"), or attempts to change someone's behavior through questioning.

Artful inquiry requires two prerequisites: suspended judgment and genuine curiosity. You must temporarily set aside what you think you know about the situation in order to learn something new. You can always return to your judgment afterward—but you can't access new information while holding onto certainty.

## How It Works

**What Blocks Genuine Inquiry:**

1. **Leading questions** - "Don't you think...?" already contains your conclusion
2. **Hypothesis-confirming questions** - Seeking evidence for what you've already decided
3. **Judgment disguised as questions** - Questions that are really criticism
4. **Yes/No questions** - Close down exploration rather than opening it up
5. **"Why" questions** - Often trigger defensiveness or rationalization

**The Problem with "Why":**

"Why did you do that?" or "Why are you upset?" puts people on the defensive. It implies they need to justify themselves. Even when asked with good intentions, "why" sounds like an accusation. It also pushes people toward rationalization rather than exploration of what's really happening.

**Better Question Starters:**

- **What** - "What's going on?" / "What's this about?"
- **When** - "When did you first notice this?"
- **Where** - "Where is this showing up most?"
- **How** - "How are you experiencing this?" / "How might we approach this?"

**The Inquiry Process:**

1. **Suspend judgment** - Deliberately set aside what you think you know
2. **Get curious** - Actually want to learn something new
3. **Ask open questions** - What/when/where/how, not why or yes/no
4. **Listen fully** - Don't plan your next question while they're talking
5. **Follow the thread** - Let their answer guide your next question
6. **Stay on your side of the net** - Don't attribute meaning; check your assumptions

## How to Apply It

**Before Asking a Question:**

1. Check your motive: Am I seeking to understand or to confirm/convince?
2. Notice if you've already decided what the answer is
3. Ask yourself: What might I learn here that I don't already know?

**During the Conversation:**

1. Use what/when/where/how instead of why
2. Avoid yes/no questions that close down exploration
3. When tempted to say "Don't you think...?" stop and rephrase as genuine inquiry
4. Let their answer genuinely surprise you
5. Follow up with "Tell me more about that" rather than leading them

**When Someone Responds Unexpectedly:**

The most powerful inquiry question: "What did you hear me say?"

This is invaluable when someone's response seems disproportionate or confusing. Instead of defending yourself or becoming confused, ask what they actually heard—often it's not what you said.

## When to Use It

- When you're about to give feedback (explore first, feedback second)
- When someone's behavior confuses or frustrates you
- When you notice yourself making assumptions about someone's motives
- In coaching conversations
- During conflict, before attempting resolution
- When you want to deepen a relationship
