# Reset Expectations

> "That very act of just putting it in there, you can also do it as an out of office autoresponder... that 'because' is really important." - Jake Knapp

## What It Is

Reset Expectations is a communication tactic for breaking free from the pressure of immediate response. By explicitly telling people you'll be slow to respond—and giving a reason—you renegotiate both their expectations and your own internal pressure.

The key insight is that most response-time stress is self-imposed. We feel like we "should" respond immediately, but rarely has anyone actually demanded that. This tactic makes the slower pace explicit, which paradoxically reduces anxiety for everyone.

The framework draws on psychological research showing the power of "because"—even weak reasons dramatically increase compliance. A famous study found that people would let others cut in line to make photocopies if they said "because I need to make copies"—a logically empty reason that still worked because it included "because."

## How It Works

### The Basic Formula
State what you're doing + "because" + a reason:

**Email signature version:**
> "I'm checking email twice a day as an experiment to improve my focus. You can text me if it's urgent."

**Out-of-office version:**
> "I'm going to be slow to respond to email because I'm working on an important project. Feel free to text if urgent."

**Conversation version:**
> "I'm going to be less responsive this month because I'm heads-down on [project]. Let me know if something's urgent."

### Why "Because" Matters
People are psychologically primed to accept reasons. "I'll be slow to respond" feels abrupt. "I'll be slow to respond because I'm working on an important project" feels reasonable—even though the reason is obvious (of course you're working on something).

### The Real Power: Internal
The external benefit is real—colleagues adjust their expectations. But the bigger benefit is internal. Putting up this "placard" changes your own sense of obligation:

- You've announced slower response time → you're allowed to respond slowly
- You've given a reason → you have permission to focus
- The guilt loop is broken → less attention residue

## How to Apply It

1. **Choose your format**:
   - Email signature (passive, always on)
   - Out-of-office autoresponder (stronger signal)
   - Conversation with key colleagues (most personal)
   - Slack status (visible to team)

2. **Craft your message** using the formula:
   - What: "I'm checking email once/twice a day"
   - Because: "because I'm working on [important project]"
   - Escalation path (optional): "Text me if urgent"

3. **Offer an escape hatch** if needed:
   - Provide a way to reach you for true emergencies
   - This makes people feel safer with your slower response
   - Most people will never use it

4. **Commit to the stated behavior**:
   - If you say twice a day, actually do twice a day
   - If you keep checking constantly, you undermine the message

### Examples

**For a focused project period:**
> "Through the end of the month, I'm checking email twice daily (9am and 4pm) to focus on [project]. Text me for anything urgent."

**For ongoing use:**
> "I check email a few times daily. For urgent matters, please text."

**For specific boundaries:**
> "I don't check email after 6pm or on weekends. For emergencies, text me."

## When to Use It

- When starting a focused project that needs deep work
- When feeling overwhelmed by response pressure
- When returning from vacation to set new norms
- When joining a new team to establish expectations early
- When communication volume becomes unsustainable
