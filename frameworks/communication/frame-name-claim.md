# Frame, Name, Claim

> "The company that gets a meaningful percentage of the world to agree with their definition of a problem set, which then leads to their definition of a solution set—the company that does that at any kind of scale, wins." — Christopher Lochhead

## What It Is

Frame, Name, Claim is the tactical process for defining and owning a new market category. It's the execution layer of category design—how you actually go about creating the mental scaffolding that positions your solution as the only logical answer to a problem you've helped define.

- **Frame**: Define the problem in a new way that creates space for your solution
- **Name**: Create language and vocabulary that makes your framing memorable and ownable
- **Claim**: Establish yourself as the authority and leader in the category you've defined

This process is what separates successful category creators from companies that simply have innovative products but fail to gain traction.

## How It Works

**Framing the Problem**: The first step is redefining the problem, not showcasing your solution. Most companies focus on their product features. Category designers obsess over how the problem is perceived.

Example: Lomi didn't frame their problem as "better garbage" or "improved recycling." They framed it as: "How do you make a difference for your family and the environment right from your kitchen?" This framing creates emotional resonance and positions a $400 appliance as worth the investment.

**Naming with New Language**: Once you've framed the problem, you need vocabulary that:
- Creates a demarcation point from old ways of thinking
- Is ownable (competitors sound like copycats if they use your language)
- Bridges from familiar concepts to new understanding

Example: Elisha Otis's "vertical railway" connected the unknown (elevator) to the known (railway) while creating new mental scaffolding for what buildings could become.

**Claiming Authority**: The final step is establishing yourself as the category leader through:
- Point of View (POV) content that educates the market
- Consistent use of your languaging across all communications
- Word of mouth from "super consumers" who adopt your framing

Example: OpenAI claimed the AI category by defining the language (LLMs, training data) and educating the world on how to think about AI.

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with the problem, not your solution**
   - Spend more time understanding and articulating the problem than showcasing your product
   - Ask: "What problem are we solving that the world doesn't yet know it has?"
   - Interview customers about the problem, not your solution

2. **Frame the problem as a "from → to" (Froto)**
   - Define what the world looks like now (the status quo you're competing against)
   - Define what the world could look like with your category
   - Make the gap between them emotionally compelling

3. **Create new language strategically**
   - Develop 3-5 key terms that define your category
   - Ensure the language connects to existing understanding
   - Test that people can repeat and explain your language

4. **Build a Point of View document**
   - Articulate the problem, the old way, the new way, and why it matters
   - Use this as the foundation for all marketing and sales communications
   - Lead with education, not selling

5. **Claim through word of mouth**
   - Focus on super consumers who will evangelize your framing
   - Put the right words in the right mouths
   - Marketing's job is to drive WOM at scale

## When to Use It

Frame, Name, Claim is essential when:

- **Launching a new product** that doesn't fit existing categories
- **Repositioning an existing product** that's being commoditized
- **Entering a market with incumbents** where you can't win on their terms
- **Building a company-defining narrative** that goes beyond product features
- **Creating sales enablement materials** that help customers understand why they need you

This framework is NOT needed when:
- You're making incremental improvements to well-understood products
- The problem you're solving is already well-defined and your differentiation is execution
- You're in a commodity market where standard terminology helps customers compare
