# Blurred Eyes Brand Test

> "Having terrible vision can be your best asset when it comes to logo and brand, because it allows you... just take your glasses off if you have terrible vision, and look at it, and get the feeling when you can't see the detail. You have to be looking at it with blurred eyes. What is the overall look of this thing? Just trying to get as broad and noodly as you can with it instead of it being about those really specific one by one stuff." - Jessica Hische

## What It Is

The Blurred Eyes Brand Test is a technique for evaluating brand identity by literally or metaphorically removing your ability to see fine details. By blurring your vision (taking off glasses, squinting, or zooming out), you force yourself to perceive only the overall impression - the color, shape, weight, and emotional impact of the brand as a whole.

This prevents getting lost in minutiae like "the way the R is drawn" before understanding whether the big-picture vibe is working. It's the visual equivalent of stepping back from a painting to see the whole composition rather than examining individual brushstrokes.

## How It Works

**The Physical Technique:**
- Remove your glasses if you wear them
- Squint until the details become indistinct
- Physically step back from the screen or printout
- Use the blur effect in design software
- View assets on a small screen to reduce detail

**What You're Looking For:**
1. **Color impression** - What's the dominant color story?
2. **Weight and density** - Does it feel heavy or light?
3. **Shape language** - Round vs. angular, regular vs. organic?
4. **Cohesion** - Do all elements blur into a unified whole or separate clumps?
5. **Recognition** - Can you still identify what it is?

## How to Apply It

1. **Gather your brand materials** - Logo, icons, marketing, website screenshots
2. **Blur your vision** - Use your preferred method
3. **Ask first-impression questions**:
   - What feeling does this give me?
   - Does it feel unified or scattered?
   - What "world" does this seem to belong to?
4. **Only then dive into details** - After validating the big picture

### Evaluation Order

1. Overall impression (blurred)
2. General direction (slightly less blurred)
3. Specific executions (clear vision)
4. Fine details (zoomed in)

The opposite order - starting with details and trying to assemble a whole - leads to missing the forest for the trees.

## When to Use It

- At the start of any brand evaluation or refresh project
- When stakeholders are fixated on details before agreeing on direction
- When something feels "off" but you can't identify why
- When comparing multiple design directions
- When presenting work to get big-picture feedback first
