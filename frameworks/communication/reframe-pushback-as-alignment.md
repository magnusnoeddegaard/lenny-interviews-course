# Reframe Pushback as Alignment

> "Pushback is, I couldn't imagine a word more viscerally that makes you feel like you're sort of physically going against what somebody else wants... It starts from a place of I need to disagree, I need to say no. It's a very negative mindset." - Jason Shah

## What It Is

"Pushback" is one of the most misunderstood terms in product management. The word itself creates a negative mindset—it gears people into thinking about how to physically go against what someone else wants.

Jason Shah argues for a reframe: instead of asking "how do I push back?", ask "how do I help the business succeed when I disagree with someone?" or "how do I shift the direction on something?"

The key insight is that leaders—especially founders—want to win. They have specific goals they care about. When you understand their actual goal (not just their stated solution), you can often find a path that gives everyone what they want.

## How It Works

The framework has two key components:

**1. Understand the actual goal, not the stated solution**

People often state solutions when they have underlying goals. A CEO asking for "a chat product with 20 features" actually wants "a magical customer experience." Understanding the real goal opens up alternative solutions.

**2. Reframe as a bigger, more exciting idea aligned with that goal**

Don't just reduce scope or say no. Offer something more exciting that achieves the real goal in a better way. This isn't window dressing—founders are too smart to be fooled by a simple renaming. It needs to be a genuinely better idea communicated effectively.

## How to Apply It

1. **Listen for the underlying goal** - When a leader proposes something you disagree with, ask: What are they actually trying to achieve? What outcome would make them excited?

2. **Connect your alternative to their goal** - Instead of "we can't build this," try "you want X? Here's a better way to achieve X."

3. **Make it a bigger idea, not just scope reduction** - Leaders don't want to "settle for less." Frame your alternative as more elegant, more on-brand, more impactful.

4. **Communicate it simply** - Even good ideas fail if poorly communicated. Find a clear way to express the reframe.

5. **Work backwards from how they see the world** - Think about what excites them, what they care about, and pitch it that way.

## When to Use It

- When asked to build something that seems wrong or too complex
- When you disagree with leadership's approach but not their goal
- When scope is out of control and teams are demoralized
- When you need to influence founders or executives on direction
- Anytime "pushback" would create an adversarial dynamic

## Examples

### Airbnb Luxury Retreats: From Concierge Chat to Trip Designers

Jason Shah describes a situation at Airbnb where a team was building a complex chat product for the Luxury Retreats integration. The team had low morale because they were building endless features into a chat system with unclear scope.

A leader effective at influencing senior leadership realized the actual goal wasn't "build a bunch of features"—it was "create a magical experience" (a core Airbnb value).

The reframe: Instead of "concierges" needing a complex chat system, they became "trip designers" whose goal was to design your trip elegantly. This shifted the product vision to a simple, efficient chat experience—more elegant, more on-brand with luxury.

Result: "Everybody gets what they want. It's a better customer experience, less scope, and it wasn't about saying no."

### Alchemy Growth Hire: From Role Debate to Winning

At Alchemy, there was debate about hiring for a "growth operations" role that didn't traditionally exist. Instead of defending the role definition or debating candidate resumes, Jason reframed around the founders' core motivation: they want to win.

"Oh, you want to win? Oh, we want to grow faster? Awesome. This is the way to do it, and that's how we're going to actually become the generational company we want to be."

The debate shifted from "should this role exist?" to "here's how this helps us achieve what we all want."

## The Sales Connection

Jason notes this is similar to effective selling. Early in his startup days, he was an unsuccessful salesperson because he focused on features instead of understanding what customers (like a CRO or Head of People) actually cared about—maybe one or two specific things.

"All they cared about were one or two things, right? Maybe the CRO's growing revenue. Maybe the head of people's worried about culture... We were nowhere near that list."

The same applies to "selling" ideas internally. Meet leaders where they are, not 10 miles away from what they're thinking about.
