# Storytelling Team

> "On the storytelling side... the storytelling team is about people we don't have the privilege of serving yet. They don't use Arc, they don't know what Arc is. That could be an investor, 'investor relations.' That could be members of the press, 'PR.' That could be just people out in the world, 'marketing' and one-day sales. But at the end of the day, it's telling our story to people." - Josh Miller

## What It Is

The Storytelling Team is an organizational model that consolidates traditionally separate outward-facing functions—PR, marketing, investor relations, content creation—into a single team responsible for telling your company's story to people who aren't yet users.

Where the Membership Team owns relationships with existing users, the Storytelling Team owns relationships with everyone else: potential users, press, investors, the general public. The reframe from "marketing" to "storytelling" shifts the focus from promoting a product to connecting with humans through narrative.

The model reflects a first-principles approach: instead of starting with industry-standard team structures (PR team, marketing team, content team), you start with the fundamental question: what are we trying to do? The answer is "tell our story to people."

## How It Works

The team structure at The Browser Company includes:

1. **Strategic leader**: Someone who understands the full narrative arc (at TBC, this is Nash, who writes poetry and dreams of writing fiction)
2. **Strategy/communications expert**: Background in understanding channels and messaging (at TBC, someone from journalism and Snapchat marketing)
3. **Creative execution**: Video editor/filmmaker who brings the story to life (at TBC, an indie filmmaker)

Key principles:

- **Radical diversity of backgrounds**: The team includes very different people, not cookie-cutter marketers
- **Unified narrative**: All external communication serves the same story, just adapted for different audiences
- **Human-centered**: Think about connecting with individual humans, not "reaching audiences"
- **In-house creative**: Video/content creation happens internally, not outsourced

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with first principles**: Instead of "we need a PR person," ask "how do we tell our story to people who don't know us yet?"

2. **Hire storytellers, not marketers**: Look for people with backgrounds in journalism, filmmaking, writing—people who think in narratives.

3. **Embrace creative diversity**: Don't hire three people who think the same way. Mix strategists, writers, and visual creators.

4. **Keep storytelling in-house**: Having your own video/content capability lets you move fast and maintain authenticity.

5. **Connect feelings to communication**: Like product development, ask "how do we want people to feel about our company before they try our product?"

6. **Build in public**: The Storytelling Team can share genuine behind-the-scenes content, not polished marketing materials.

## When to Use It

- When your brand and emotional connection are competitive advantages
- When traditional PR/marketing feels inauthentic or ineffective
- When you want to build trust before people try your product
- When competing against incumbents where differentiation comes from company culture/values
- When you have a compelling founder/team story to tell
