# Hot Ham Water Brand Test

> "When you learn how to cook, it's like you're making a pot full of ingredients and none of the ingredients are actually working together. But then the more you do it and the more you understand how these things are meant to blend... you start having this cohesive dish rather than hot ham water. I feel like a lot of clients come to me and they have hot ham water when it comes to their brand. It's just about turning that into a soup, something that feels real." - Jessica Hische

## What It Is

The Hot Ham Water Brand Test is a diagnostic for evaluating whether your brand elements feel unified or disjointed. Named after the famously terrible dish from Arrested Development, it asks: do your logo, typography, colors, and illustrations feel like they were created together by the same hand, or do they feel like random ingredients thrown into a pot?

A cohesive brand is like a well-made soup where flavors complement each other. Hot ham water is when you have disparate elements - maybe clip art icons, a generic font, and colors that don't relate - that don't work together despite being technically present.

## How It Works

**Signs of "Hot Ham Water" Branding:**
- Logo uses one style, website uses another, marketing uses a third
- Illustration style doesn't match the typography style
- Elements feel "tacked on" rather than integrated
- You can tell different parts were made by different people at different times
- No consistent visual language or system

**Signs of Cohesive Branding:**
- All elements feel like they came from the same universe
- Typography and illustration could have been drawn by the same hand
- Colors, weights, and spacing follow consistent logic
- New applications feel natural to create within the system
- The brand teaches you how to use it through its own consistency

## How to Apply It

1. **Gather all brand assets** - Logo, typography, colors, illustrations, icons, marketing materials
2. **Place them side by side** - Literally lay them out together visually
3. **Ask the cohesion question** - "Do these feel like they came from the same kitchen?"
4. **Identify the outliers** - What feels like it doesn't belong?
5. **Decide: unify or remove** - Either update elements to match or eliminate the discord

### Diagnostic Questions

- If you showed these elements without context, would someone know they're related?
- Does the illustration style match the "personality" of the typography?
- Could the same designer have reasonably created all of these?
- When you add new elements, is it obvious how they should look?

## When to Use It

- Before investing in physical brand materials (swag, conference booths)
- When onboarding a new design team member
- When reviewing the output of multiple contributors
- When planning a brand refresh
- When something feels "off" but you can't articulate what
