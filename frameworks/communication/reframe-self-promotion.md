# Reframe Self-Promotion as Education

> "If you think your self-review is self-promotion, you're just not going to do a great job at it. What if I called it educating your manager about all the great work your team has been doing? What if I called it helping people see why your team should get more resources?" - Deb Liu

## What It Is

This framework helps introverts and those uncomfortable with self-promotion reframe visibility work as an act of service rather than ego. The insight is that how you label an activity changes your willingness to do it.

Calling it "self-promotion" triggers resistance—it feels icky, self-serving, and braggy. But calling it "educating others about your team's impact" or "helping stakeholders understand why your work matters" makes the same activity feel like leadership.

The framework addresses a key workplace bias: people who speak up get noticed, resourced, and promoted, while equally talented people who stay quiet get overlooked. You can fight this bias while also adapting to it.

## How It Works

**The Reframe:**

| Self-Promotion Framing | Education Framing |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| "Bragging about myself" | "Helping my manager understand our impact" |
| "Showing off" | "Getting my team the resources they deserve" |
| "Being political" | "Making sure stakeholders can make informed decisions" |
| "Self-serving" | "Ensuring credit goes where it belongs" |

**Why This Works:**

1. **It's actually true** - When you share your work, you genuinely are educating others who don't have your visibility
2. **It shifts focus from self to team** - Education framing naturally centers the team's work, not your ego
3. **It makes the stakes clear** - Your team's resources, recognition, and growth depend on visibility

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your resistance** - Notice when you avoid visibility activities. What label are you putting on them?

2. **Consciously reframe** - Before writing a self-review, sending an update, or presenting your work, say: "I'm educating stakeholders about this work"

3. **Focus on the team** - Even when the visibility benefits you personally, frame it around team impact and team needs

4. **Remember the consequences** - If a great product exists but no one is told about it, did it exist? Your work needs "product marketing" too

5. **Make it a commitment** - Bos asked Deb Liu to publish something every month. Having external accountability helps overcome resistance

6. **Write what you repeat** - If you explain something more than once, write it down. This makes sharing feel more like documentation than promotion

## When to Use It

- Writing self-reviews or performance documents
- Preparing for calibration or promotion discussions
- Sending status updates or weekly reports
- Deciding whether to share insights publicly
- Coaching introverted team members on visibility
- Presenting your team's work to leadership
