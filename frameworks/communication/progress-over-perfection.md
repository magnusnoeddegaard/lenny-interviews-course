# Progress Over Perfection

> "Progress over perfection. I think that you just need to... The velocity of information is far more important than something that I think is perfect and perfection is an outcome that you get to. But progress over perfection all day, any day." - Elena Verna

## What It Is

Progress Over Perfection is a life and work motto that prioritizes forward movement and learning velocity over getting things exactly right from the start. It reframes perfection as an outcome of iteration rather than a prerequisite for action.

This mindset is particularly important for growth roles where experimentation, failure, and rapid learning are essential to success.

## How It Works

### The Reframe

**Traditional thinking:** Get it perfect before shipping.
**Progress thinking:** Ship to learn, iterate toward perfection.

Perfection isn't the starting point—it's what you eventually get to through many cycles of progress.

### Why It Matters for Growth

Growth work inherently involves:
- High failure rates (70-80% of experiments fail)
- Rapid market changes
- Imperfect information
- Need for speed

Waiting for perfection means:
- Missing windows
- Learning slowly
- Getting outpaced by competitors willing to iterate

### Velocity of Information

Elena emphasizes "velocity of information" specifically. The faster you learn:
- What works and doesn't work
- What customers actually want
- What the market rewards

...the faster you can iterate toward an outcome that actually works.

## How to Apply It

1. **Ask "What's blocking progress?"**
   - Is the blocker real or perfectionism?
   - What's the minimum needed to learn?

2. **Ship earlier than comfortable**
   - Discomfort often signals perfectionism
   - The market teaches faster than internal review

3. **Set iteration expectations**
   - V1 won't be perfect
   - Budget for V2, V3 upfront
   - Communicate this to stakeholders

4. **Measure progress, not polish**
   - Are you learning?
   - Are you shipping?
   - Are you moving forward?

## Connection to Growth Anti-Patterns

This motto directly opposes several anti-patterns Elena identifies:

- **Testing everything:** Progress is blocked waiting for statistical significance
- **Thinking problems are unique:** Progress is blocked by reinventing instead of building on patterns
- **Redesigns for perfection:** Progress resets to zero while chasing an ideal
