# Calm Confidence

> "The posture we should have is calm confidence. We really understand why people should pick us. We really understand who that's a really good fit for, and we don't even bother trying to chase anybody else." - April Dunford

## What It Is

A sales and positioning posture that comes from deeply understanding your differentiated value and ideal customer. When you know exactly why certain customers should pick you—and equally important, why others shouldn't—you can approach sales conversations with neither desperation nor arrogance.

Calm confidence means being willing to say "we're not the one for you" when a prospect isn't a good fit, while being unafraid to fight hard for business where you truly are the best choice. It's the opposite of chasing every deal or being defensive about competitors.

## How It Works

**The Source of Calm Confidence**

1. **Deep understanding of differentiated value** - You know exactly what value you deliver that no alternative can match
2. **Clear fit criteria** - You know specifically who that value matters most to
3. **Honest assessment of alternatives** - You can give genuine credit to competitors for what they do well

**What It Looks Like in Practice**

"Look, these guys are good for this, these folks are good for this, and we're good for this. And you might not care about that—and if you don't care about that, we're not the one for you. You shouldn't pick us."

**Example (Help Scout)**

- "If you're a really small, not-growing e-commerce business, use a shared inbox. It's free, it's easy to use, there's no problems."
- "If you're really worried about bringing costs down in a customer service center, maybe you should use Zendesk."
- "But if customer service is a growth driver for your digital business, that's us."

## How to Apply It

1. **Do the positioning work first** - Calm confidence is impossible without clear differentiated value. You can't project confidence in something you don't understand.

2. **Define your ideal customer precisely** - Not just demographics, but the specific situation and priorities that make someone a great fit.

3. **Know what your competitors do well** - Be able to honestly recommend alternatives when they're better suited.

4. **Disqualify aggressively** - If someone doesn't share your point of view during the setup phase, recognize they're not your customer.

5. **Fight for fits** - When you know a prospect is perfect for you, be unafraid to compete hard for that business.

6. **Trust your qualification process** - Good qualification upstream means you can be confident in calls because you're talking to the right people.

## When to Use It

- **Any sales conversation** - This is a posture, not a tactic
- **Competitive situations** - When directly compared to alternatives
- **When asked "Why should we pick you?"** - The question calm confidence answers
- **Discovery calls** - To quickly identify fit vs. no-fit
- **Positioning discussions** - As the end-state you're working toward

## The Opposite: Desperate Selling

Without calm confidence, sales often becomes:
- Chasing every deal regardless of fit
- Being defensive or evasive about competitors
- Overselling or promising things you can't deliver
- Discounting to win business you shouldn't want
- Exhausting yourself fighting for the wrong customers
