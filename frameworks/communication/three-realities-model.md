# Three Realities Model

> "In any exchange between two people, there are three realities. There is my intent, how I see the world, my background, my history, there is what I do or say or don't do, verbal or nonverbal. And whatever happens on your end is reality number three... We don't understand that we are only privy to two out of the three." - Carole Robin

## What It Is

The Three Realities Model is a fundamental framework for understanding interpersonal communication and the source of most relationship conflicts. It explains why misunderstandings happen and provides the foundation for giving effective feedback.

The key insight is that in any interaction between two people, there are three distinct realities:
1. **Reality #1 (Intent)** - What's going on inside Person A: their intent, background, feelings, motivations
2. **Reality #2 (Behavior)** - What Person A actually says or does (or doesn't say/do), including nonverbal communication
3. **Reality #3 (Impact)** - What happens inside Person B: how they perceive, interpret, and feel about the behavior

The critical problem: each person only has access to TWO of these realities. Person A knows their intent (#1) and their behavior (#2), but has no direct access to the impact (#3). Person B observes the behavior (#2) and knows the impact on themselves (#3), but has no direct access to intent (#1).

## How It Works

**Person A's View:**
- Knows: My intent (what I meant) + My behavior (what I did)
- Doesn't know: The impact on you (how you received it)

**Person B's View:**
- Knows: Your behavior (what you did) + My impact (how I feel)
- Doesn't know: Your intent (what you meant)

**Where Conflict Happens:**
When Person B feels hurt by Person A's behavior, they often assume they know Person A's intent ("You don't care," "You're being insensitive"). Person A then feels misjudged because Person B doesn't actually have access to their intent. This creates defensive escalation.

**The Net Metaphor:**
Imagine a net between Reality #1 and Reality #2. Everything on one side of the net belongs to Person A (their intent). Everything on the other side involves Person B (their perception and impact). Effective feedback requires staying on your own side of the net—speaking only to the two realities you actually know.

## How to Apply It

When giving feedback:

1. **Describe behavior (Reality #2)** - State objectively what you observed. "When you looked at your watch while I was talking..."

2. **Share your impact (Reality #3)** - Name your actual feelings using a vocabulary of feelings. "...I felt unheard and dismissed."

3. **State your purpose** - Explain why you're sharing this. "I'm telling you this because I want us to communicate better."

4. **Avoid crossing the net** - Never attribute intent you can't know. Don't say "I feel that you don't care" (that's attributing intent). Say "I feel hurt" (that's your actual feeling).

When receiving feedback:

1. **Ask "What did you hear me say?"** - When someone responds unexpectedly, find out what they actually heard before defending yourself.

2. **Accept that impact ≠ intent** - Even with good intentions, your behavior can have negative impact. Both realities are valid.

3. **Stay curious about their reality** - You don't have access to their experience; ask questions rather than making assumptions.

## When to Use It

- Any time you need to give constructive feedback
- During conflict resolution conversations
- When someone responds to you in an unexpected way
- Before making assumptions about someone's motives
- In marriage, parenting, and close relationships
- Leadership situations where trust depends on communication
