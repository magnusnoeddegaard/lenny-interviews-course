# Context Creation Strategy

> "Sometimes you are not the story, but you can be part of the story... Sometimes that means reaching out and saying, 'Here's a trend happening and we are one of them.' Well, great, that's an interesting story." - Jason Feifer

## What It Works

When your company is hard to write about directly (B2B services, niche products), create newsworthy context that publications want to cover—and position yourself as a natural part of that story.

Instead of pitching "write about our company," you pitch "here's something interesting happening in the world, and we happen to have relevant data/expertise/a role in it."

This flips the dynamic: you're giving journalists something valuable to write about, and incidentally getting featured.

## The Three Approaches

### 1. Create Original Data/Research

**The Barbara Corcoran story:**

Before Barbara Corcoran was famous, she was just a random NYC realtor. She created "The Corcoran Report"—compiling her own sales data into a report on the Manhattan real estate market.

Because nobody else was doing this, publications started reporting on her report as authoritative. This positioned her as THE expert on Manhattan real estate, building the foundation for her empire.

**Modern version:**

"Remote work consulting companies will pay a surveying firm to find all sorts of things: the top states for remote work, the top companies for remote work. They produce all these surveys and send them out. The surveys get covered because now they're creating a piece of news."

### 2. Identify Trends You're Part Of

**The death preparation startups example:**

One startup reached out saying, "Here's a trend happening: there are a bunch of startups helping people prepare for death." A single company isn't a story, but a trend of multiple companies tackling the same problem IS a story.

The company that reached out got prominent billing because they surfaced the trend.

### 3. Surface a Problem or Phenomenon

**The Ripple Rug story:**

Fred Ruckel pitched his cat toy company. Not interesting. But then he mentioned "a gigantic scam happening on Amazon and eBay."

He exposed Amazon-to-eBay arbitrage (people copying his listing, selling at markup, ordering from Amazon to ship to the eBay buyer). This became a 3-4,000 word investigative piece—with Fred as the main character.

He stumbled into this, but the lesson is intentional: what problems or phenomena do you have unique insight into?

## How to Apply It

1. **Audit your unique knowledge:** What do you know about your industry that others don't? What data do you have access to? What problems have you discovered?

2. **Create original research:**
   - Survey your customers
   - Analyze your platform data
   - Track trends in your space
   - The Zapier example: "Every single year about the fastest growing business apps based on Zapier data"

3. **Spot emerging trends:**
   - Are multiple companies solving similar problems?
   - Is there a shift happening in your industry?
   - Can you be the one who names it?

4. **Surface hidden problems:**
   - What industry dysfunction have you observed?
   - What are people not talking about but should be?
   - What would other business owners want to know?

5. **Position yourself naturally:**
   - You don't need to be the main character
   - Being a credible source or example is often enough
   - Reach out first to get prominent placement
