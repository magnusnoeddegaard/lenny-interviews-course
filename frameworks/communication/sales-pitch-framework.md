# Sales Pitch Framework

> "40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes end in no decision. The majority of those is they couldn't figure out how to make a choice confidently. So what they did was they just went to their boss and said, 'Now's not a good time. Let's not do it now.'" - April Dunford

## What It Is

A structured sales pitch framework that moves away from feature-dumping product demos toward a narrative that helps buyers understand why they should choose you over alternatives. Most sales pitches fail because they're essentially glorified product tours—clicking through every dropdown menu without answering the fundamental question: "Why pick us over the other guys?"

The framework has two major parts: **The Setup** (about the market, not about you) and **The Follow-Through** (about your differentiated value). The setup should be brief—a few minutes in a 30-45 minute call—but it's essential because it creates the context that makes your differentiated value meaningful.

This approach recognizes that buyers are often overwhelmed, have never purchased software like yours before, and are terrified of making the wrong choice. By helping them understand the market landscape first, you build trust and enable confident decision-making.

## How It Works

### Part 1: The Setup

**1. Insight**
Your point of view on the market—the "problem inside the problem." This is the reason you built what you built.

*Example (Help Scout):* "Customer service is just different for digital businesses—it's a growth driver, not a cost center."

**2. Alternative Approaches (Pros and Cons)**
Paint a picture of the entire market. Discuss what works and doesn't work about other ways to approach the problem.

*Example:* "Most folks start with a shared inbox—easy to use, reps love it. The problem is you outgrow it. Then you upgrade to help desk software, but it wasn't built for digital businesses—it assigns ticket numbers and pushes to low-cost channels."

**3. Perfect World**
Get alignment with the customer on what a good solution should look like.

*Example:* "Can we agree that a really good solution should be as easy to use as an inbox, have all the features so you never outgrow it, AND be built from the ground up to deliver amazing customer service?"

### Part 2: The Follow-Through

**4. Introduction**
Briefly introduce your company and category position.

*Example:* "We're Help Scout. We're customer service software built specifically for digital businesses."

**5. Differentiated Value**
Show the value you deliver and how you deliver it. This is the meat of the call—spend more than half your time here.

*Example:* "Three things. One: as easy as an inbox—here's how. Two: features so you never outgrow it—here's the demo. Three: built for amazing experience—customers stay Dave, not ticket #1479."

**6. Proof**
Demonstrate you can do what you claim. Customer case studies or third-party validation.

**7. Objections (Optional)**
Handle silent objections that haven't come up: "Sounds good, but IT will never approve this" or "This is probably too expensive."

**8. The Ask**
Whatever the next step in your sales process is—the sale, a proof of concept, identifying stakeholders for a project.

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with positioning** - Before building the pitch, nail your differentiated value. The pitch is only as good as the positioning underneath it.

2. **Involve sales in building the pitch** - Sales reps won't abandon their comfortable old pitch unless they're part of creating the new one.

3. **Train your best rep first** - Don't roll out to the whole team. Train one top performer, have them test with qualified prospects, iterate together.

4. **Test and tune** - After every pitch, huddle: What worked? What didn't? Maybe that word trips people up. Maybe move this slide.

5. **Let sales sell sales** - Once your best rep is convinced the new pitch works better, have them teach and sell the rest of the team on it.

## When to Use It

- **First substantive sales calls** with qualified prospects
- **Product demos** where you need to differentiate from competitors
- **Enterprise B2B sales** where buyers face significant purchase risk
- **Founder-led sales** when you're the only salesperson
- **Repositioning your product** and need to test new positioning live

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Feature dumping** - Clicking through every dropdown menu without context
- **Skipping the setup** - Jumping straight to product without establishing your point of view
- **Talking AT customers** - The setup should be a conversation with discovery, not a monologue
- **Using FOMO on indecisive buyers** - Data shows this makes indecision worse, not better
- **Pitching value to everyone** - Your champion needs the value pitch; IT just needs objection handling
