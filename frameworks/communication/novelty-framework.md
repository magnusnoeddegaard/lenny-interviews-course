# Novelty Framework

> "Novelty is what gets people to click into a thread and read it. I define novelty as a new idea that's also significant, and something I wouldn't have easily intuited on my own. When you have those ingredients, that's when you trigger that dopamine hit reaction." - Julian Shapiro

## What It Is

The Novelty Framework is a formula for evaluating and creating high-quality writing:

**Writing Quality = Novelty x Resonance**

**Novelty** is information that is:
1. New - something the reader hasn't heard before
2. Significant - not trivial or irrelevant
3. Non-obvious - something they wouldn't have easily figured out themselves

**Resonance** is what makes novelty stick:
- Examples that illustrate the point
- Analogies that create understanding
- Metaphors that paint pictures
- Stories that create emotional connection

Without resonance, novelty is just trivia. Without novelty, polished writing is boring. You need both.

## How It Works

### The Five Categories of Novelty

**1. Counterintuitive**
Reader thinks: "I never realized the world worked that way"
- Challenges assumptions about how things function
- Reveals hidden mechanisms or unexpected truths

**2. Counter-Narrative**
Reader thinks: "That's not what I've been told - I've been lied to"
- Contradicts prevailing wisdom or accepted narratives
- Positions you as truth-teller vs. the consensus

**3. Shock and Awe**
Reader thinks: "That's crazy - I would have never believed that"
- Extreme facts or statistics
- Dramatic outcomes or consequences

**4. Elegant Articulation**
Reader thinks: "Wow, I couldn't have said that better myself"
- Boiling complex ideas into concise sentences
- Crystallizing what others feel but can't express

**5. Non-obvious Connections**
Reader thinks: "I never would have connected those dots"
- Drawing parallels between unrelated domains
- Synthesizing disparate ideas into new insight

### Julian's Writing Process

**Draft 1**: Focus purely on novelty - identify the backbone of what makes the piece interesting

**Draft 2**: Add resonance - embed stories, analogies, and examples

**Review Process**: Have 20 friends read and highlight sentences that made them go "Whoa." Then condense the white space between highlights to maximize novelty density.

### Example Analysis

Julian's tweet: "Reading many books is the most socially accepted vanity metric for adults."

- **Novelty type**: Counter-narrative
- **Why it works**: The prevailing narrative says smart people read a lot. Julian calls this a vanity metric - contradicting accepted wisdom
- **Result**: Dopamine hit + engagement

## How to Apply It

1. **Capture novelty when you encounter it**
   - Write down anything that surprises you
   - Score it 0-5 for how novel it felt at the moment
   - Your novelty-meter will fade over time, so record it immediately

2. **Identify the novelty type before writing**
   - Which category does your insight fall into?
   - Lead with the most novel statement
   - Make sure it's new, significant, and non-obvious

3. **Map your novelty density**
   - Get readers to highlight "whoa" moments
   - Visualize where the highlights are
   - Cut or condense everything between them

4. **Add resonance last**
   - Don't let storytelling obscure the novelty
   - Use examples that make abstract concrete
   - Balance - some readers prefer concise, others prefer story

## When to Use It

- **Content creation**: Evaluating whether a piece is worth writing
- **Editing**: Identifying what to cut and what to keep
- **Topic selection**: Choosing what to write about based on novelty potential
- **Social media**: Crafting posts that generate engagement
- **Presentations**: Structuring talks around novel insights
