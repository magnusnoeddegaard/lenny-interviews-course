# Newspaper Headline Approach

> "Imagine two years there's a newspaper, there's a journalist that covers this work, and there's a newspaper article that comes out. I want you to imagine the progress on all these strategic pillars and what the headline of that newspaper article looks like." - Chandra Janakiraman

## What It Is

The Newspaper Headline Approach is a technique for creating your strategy's "winning aspiration"—a compelling statement of what success looks like when your strategy succeeds. It works by having each team member independently imagine future press coverage of their success, then blending those visions into a single aspirational statement.

The technique works for several reasons:
- Headlines force simplicity and plain language (not technical jargon)
- They require focusing on the impact and benefit, not features
- Independent generation reveals common themes organically
- Everyone sees their contribution in the final output, building ownership

## How It Works

**Step 1: Set the Context**
After your strategy sprint has produced strategic pillars, give the team this prompt:
"Imagine it's 2 years from now. A journalist who covers our work writes an article. Imagine progress on all our strategic pillars has been achieved. What's the headline?"

**Step 2: Generate Headlines Independently**
Each strategy working group member writes their own headline. No discussion yet—independent generation prevents groupthink and reveals genuine patterns.

**Step 3: Share All Headlines**
Put every headline on a slide or whiteboard where everyone can see them. Don't critique yet—just display.

**Step 4: Find Common Themes**
Look for words and concepts that appear across multiple headlines. These represent the shared vision already present in the team's minds. Circle or highlight these common elements.

**Step 5: Blend Into One**
Using the common elements as building blocks, craft a single winning aspiration that incorporates the strongest language from multiple headlines. Everyone should see pieces of their headline in the final version.

**Example from the episode:**
For Meta's privacy team, the winning aspiration became: "Facebook has moved the needle on consumer trust by investing in [strategic areas]."

## How to Apply It

1. **Do this on Day 3 of your strategy sprint**: After the intense Day 2 pillar selection, people come back refreshed and can think aspirationally

2. **Give clear constraints**: "One sentence, newspaper-style, focuses on the impact not the features"

3. **Make it visual**: Display all headlines like a word cloud so patterns emerge visually

4. **Include the timeline**: Winning aspirations should have an implicit or explicit time horizon (typically 2 years for "small s" strategy)

5. **Test for inspiration**: The final aspiration should energize the team, not just describe activities

6. **Connect to pillars**: The aspiration should feel achievable IF you succeed on your strategic pillars

**Good winning aspirations:**
- Focus on impact and outcomes, not activities
- Use plain language anyone could understand
- Create emotional resonance and excitement
- Have an implicit or explicit time horizon
- Feel ambitious but achievable

**Bad winning aspirations:**
- List features or capabilities
- Use jargon or technical language
- Sound like mission statements (too permanent)
- Lack specificity about what success means

## When to Use It

- Day 3 of a strategy sprint when formulating winning aspiration
- Annual planning when setting team vision
- Kickoff meetings to align on success criteria
- Project planning when defining success metrics
- Any time you need a team to converge on a shared vision of success
