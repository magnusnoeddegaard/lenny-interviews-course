# As Seen In Strategy

> "As seen in is probably more valuable than anyone actually reading that story to begin with. They probably won't read the story. You might not even have to link it on the website. But you could just get to say 'as seen in.' Because again, it gives you that validation." - Jason Feifer

## What It Is

A strategic reframe on press coverage: the primary value often isn't reaching the publication's audience directly—it's the social proof and credibility that comes from being featured.

Most articles in major publications reach far fewer people than entrepreneurs expect. Even at outlets with millions of monthly visitors, individual stories often reach only 5,000-10,000 readers. But the "As Seen In" badge on your website or in your emails can be worth more than all those direct readers combined.

## How It Works

**The reality of press reach:**

Publications like Entrepreneur, Forbes, and Fast Company reach millions of unique visitors monthly. But that doesn't mean YOUR story reaches millions. The overwhelming majority of stories reach a small fraction of that audience.

**Where the real value lies:**

1. **Website credibility:** "As Seen In Entrepreneur, Forbes, TechCrunch" badges build instant trust with visitors

2. **Sales enablement:** Every cold email can reference the coverage, making recipients pay more attention

3. **Paid amplification:** Take the article, promote it on social with paid spend, and target exactly who you want to see it

4. **Partner/investor conversations:** "Variety covered us" changes the dynamic in business development

5. **Talent attraction:** Candidates researching your company see legitimate coverage

**Jason's own example:**

His podcast company Money News Network got coverage in Variety. Did they get direct signups from readers? "The answer is no, like nothing." But every email to potential advertisers and partners includes that link, and it makes people pay more attention.

## How to Apply It

1. **Reframe your success metrics:** Don't measure press success by traffic or conversions. Measure by:
   - Can you use the logo on your website?
   - Does it strengthen your sales collateral?
   - Does it help in specific conversations?

2. **Target for credibility, not reach:** Sometimes a smaller, more prestigious outlet is better than a larger, less respected one

3. **Plan your amplification:** Before pursuing press, plan how you'll leverage it:
   - Where will you feature the logo?
   - Which emails will include the link?
   - Will you promote the article with paid spend?

4. **Build a portfolio:** Multiple "As Seen In" badges compound credibility—collect logos over time

5. **Use it actively:** Don't just put it on your website passively. Reference it in sales calls, investor pitches, and recruiting conversations

## When to Use It

- **Pre-fundraising** - Build a credibility portfolio before investor meetings
- **Sales enablement** - Equip your team with third-party validation
- **Website conversion** - Add trust signals to high-intent pages
- **Recruiting** - Help candidates understand your company's legitimacy
- **Partnership negotiations** - Change the dynamic with social proof

## The TechCrunch Example

"Why get the funding announcement in TechCrunch? Probably not because anyone's going to care because they read it on TechCrunch, but now you can use that to your own means."

The coverage becomes a tool you wield, not a megaphone you speak through.
