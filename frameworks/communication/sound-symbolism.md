# Sound Symbolism

> "V, from our research that we've done, is the most alive and vibrant sound in the English alphabet. And that's whether you were born in Rome or in Sausalito, California." - David Placek

## What It Is

Sound Symbolism is the study of how individual letters and sounds evoke specific feelings, associations, and experiences - largely universally across cultures. This isn't about what letters mean semantically, but about the subconscious signals they send when heard or read.

David Placek's firm Lexicon Branding has invested millions in research with Stanford, MIT, and Berkeley linguists to map the emotional qualities of all 26 letters of the English alphabet. This knowledge informs their naming process for brands like Pentium, Blackberry, Sonos, Vercel, and Windsurf.

## How It Works

Each letter sends a distinct "vibration" or experience. Key findings from Lexicon's research:

**V** - The most alive and vibrant sound
- Creates energy and dynamism
- Examples: Corvette (fast, powerful), Viagra, Vercel
- Works globally regardless of native language

**B** - One of the most reliable sounds
- Evokes dependability and trustworthiness
- Examples: Blackberry (two Bs add reliability)
- Why it was key to convincing the founders Blackberry would work

**Z** - A noisy, attention-grabbing letter
- Creates distinctiveness and signal strength
- Examples: Azure, Amazon
- Good for standing out in crowded markets

**S** - Another noisy letter
- Creates sonic presence
- Examples: Sonos (double S creates sound associations)
- Works well for audio and sensory products

**X** - Fast and crisp
- Evokes innovation and cutting-edge technology
- Semantic associations with aircraft and computers
- Good for tech products emphasizing speed

**Balanced names** combine noisy letters (for attention) with smooth flows (for processing):
- Azure: Starts with A, has noisy Z, ends in smooth flow
- Vercel: Strong V opening, smooth cel ending (like accelerate)

## How to Apply It

1. **Define your desired experience first**
   - What feeling should the name evoke?
   - Dynamic? Reliable? Innovative? Calm?

2. **Identify letters that signal those qualities**
   - Need vibrance? Use V
   - Need reliability? Use B
   - Need to stand out? Use Z, S, or X
   - Need calm flow? Use L, M, N endings

3. **Balance noise with processing ease**
   - Noisy letters create attention and signal strength
   - But balance with smooth, easy-to-process elements
   - Names shouldn't be all noise or all soft

4. **Consider letter combinations**
   - Opening sounds matter most for first impressions
   - Endings affect how the name flows when spoken
   - Internal sounds add texture and association

5. **Test across cultures**
   - Core sound symbolism is universal
   - But check for unintended meanings in target markets

## When to Use It

- When generating naming candidates
- When evaluating a shortlist of potential names
- When trying to understand why a name "feels" right or wrong
- When building a naming brief with specific sonic qualities
- When choosing between similar name options
