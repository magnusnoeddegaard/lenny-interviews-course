# RCCP Cold Outreach Framework

> "If you can focus the messaging in a way that speaks to something that has a bit of shock value, or is counterintuitive, you'll get them to continue reading... Don't even talk about the solution. Talk about the problem that you want to solve, and why it needs to be solved or why it's not good enough today." - Jen Abel

## What It Is

The RCCP Cold Outreach Framework is a four-part structure for writing cold emails, LinkedIn messages, and cold call scripts that actually get responses. It focuses on making the prospect pause and engage rather than delete.

The framework deliberately avoids common cold outreach mistakes like leading with your solution, claiming to be "better," or personalizing with stale details that feel creepy or lazy.

## How It Works

### The Four Components

**R - Relevancy**
Why is this message relevant to ME, in MY role, right now? Relevancy matters more than personalization. Don't reference their old podcast appearance from three years ago—show you understand their current situation.

**C - Counterintuitive**
Say something that makes them say "What?" or "How could that be?" or "I've never thought about it that way." This creates a pause that breaks through the inbox noise.

**C - Concise**
Three to four sentences maximum. The message should be readable without scrolling on a mobile phone. This is how founders write. This is how executives write.

**P - Problem-Focused**
Don't talk about your solution. Lead with the problem you want to solve and why it needs to be solved now. Leave them wanting more.

### Why "Better" Doesn't Work

Never position yourself as "better than X product." Better is dangerous because:
- Better means something different to everyone
- It invites the question: "Should we just give our current vendor another year to improve?"
- It doesn't create urgency or differentiation
- Procurement will ask you to define and prove "better"

Instead, position as **different** or **counterintuitive**.

## How to Apply It

1. **Write your subject line and first line for relevancy**
   - Why are you reaching out to THIS person?
   - What about their situation makes this relevant NOW?

2. **Lead with your counterintuitive insight**
   - "Zero to one sales talent doesn't exist" (Jen Abel's example)
   - "Most companies solve X wrong by doing Y"
   - Make them stop and think

3. **Cut ruthlessly**
   - Read it on your phone
   - If you have to scroll, cut more
   - Gmail's audio playback feature can reveal awkward phrasing

4. **End with the problem, not a pitch**
   - "I'm deeply passionate about solving [problem]"
   - "We have a lot to learn about [problem]"
   - Don't describe your solution

5. **Test: Would YOU respond to this?**
   - Highlight the email and have Gmail read it back to you
   - If it sounds passive-aggressive or salesy, rewrite

## Example Template

```
Subject: [Relevancy trigger - their situation]

[First sentence: Why this is relevant to them specifically]

Our belief: [Counterintuitive statement that makes them pause]

I'd love to learn how [problem] is showing up on your side.

- [Your name], Founder
```

## When to Use It

- Cold email campaigns
- LinkedIn connection messages and InMails
- Cold call opening scripts
- Any first touch with a prospect

## What Good Looks Like

Jen Abel's own cold email that landed her first 20 customers:

*"Our belief at Jellyfish is zero to one sales talent doesn't exist. That's why we built this model."*

This works because:
- It's counterintuitive (challenges the assumption that you can hire sales talent)
- It's problem-focused (the challenge of early-stage sales)
- It's concise (one sentence core message)
- Relevancy was added by targeting recently-funded startups
