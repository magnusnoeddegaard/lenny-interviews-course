# Pain Over Upside (80/20 Buying Rule)

> "80% of customers buy to avoid pain or reduce risk as opposed to increased upside, which is a good thing for startup founders to understand. We all love to talk about the art of the possible, everything we're going to enable in the future, but that's often really a sale that's going to resonate with another founder." - Jeanne DeWitt Grosser

## What It Is

The 80/20 Buying Rule states that roughly 80% of buying decisions are driven by avoiding pain or reducing risk, while only 20% are driven by pursuing upside. This insight has profound implications for how startups should sell.

Founders naturally gravitate toward "art of the possible" messaging—the exciting vision of what customers could achieve. This resonates well with other founders and visionaries. But most buyers, especially in enterprises, are actually motivated by fear: missing revenue targets, falling behind competitors, suffering brand damage, or making a career-damaging purchase decision.

This doesn't mean you should lead with fear-mongering. Rather, you should connect your solution to real risks and pain points rather than purely aspirational benefits.

## How It Works

The framework shifts messaging emphasis based on buyer motivation:

**Upside-Focused Messaging (Resonates with ~20%)**:
- "Enable new capabilities"
- "Unlock growth potential"
- "Transform your business"
- "Be an industry leader"

**Pain/Risk-Focused Messaging (Resonates with ~80%)**:
- "Stop losing revenue to slow page loads"
- "Reduce the risk of security breaches"
- "Avoid missing your quarterly targets"
- "Don't let competitors outpace you"

The shift is subtle but important. You're not selling doom and gloom—you're connecting your solution to real problems the buyer already worries about.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify Real Pains**: Through discovery, understand what keeps your buyer up at night. What are they measured on? What could get them fired?

2. **Connect Solutions to Pains**: For each feature or benefit, ask "What pain does this solve?" rather than "What upside does this enable?"

3. **Quantify the Risk**: Make the pain concrete with numbers: "Companies with slow sites lose 7% in conversions per second of delay."

4. **Use Social Proof Defensively**: "Your competitors are already doing this" is more motivating than "Be a leader in adopting this."

5. **Adjust by Buyer Type**:
   - Other founders → Upside messaging can work
   - Enterprises → Pain/risk messaging is essential
   - Technical buyers → Different pains than business buyers

6. **Frame Upside as Risk Mitigation**: "AI features aren't just about growth—without them, you risk becoming irrelevant."

## When to Use It

- When selling to enterprises or large organizations
- When dealing with risk-averse buyers (procurement, legal, finance)
- When your product prevents losses rather than enabling gains
- When competing for budget against "do nothing"
- When messaging isn't resonating despite a good product
