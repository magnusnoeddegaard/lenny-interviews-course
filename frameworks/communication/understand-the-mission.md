# Understand the Mission

> "The editor, the writer, I'll just say it as plainly as possible. They don't care about you. They don't care about you. They care about their reader or their listener or their viewer. That's who they care about. That's who they're serving." - Jason Feifer

## What It Is

A fundamental reframe for approaching media: stop treating editors and writers as service providers who exist to give you coverage. Instead, understand that every publication has a specific mission—and your job is to figure out how you can serve that mission.

Different publications with similar audiences can have completely different editorial missions. Fast Company and Entrepreneur are both business magazines, but they serve their readers in fundamentally different ways. Understanding this distinction determines whether your pitch lands or gets deleted.

## How It Works

**Every publication optimizes for something specific:**

*Fast Company (under Bob Safian):* "Where is business going?" Stories needed to be representative of the evolution of business—helping readers understand industry trends and shape their own companies.

*Entrepreneur Magazine:* "It's not even a magazine about business. It's a magazine about thinking." Jason wants readers to walk away with insights into how to think through challenges. He looks for counterintuitive decisions that solved problems.

**The butter dish example illustrates this perfectly:**

A woman named Joelle Mertzel makes an innovative butter dish with a hinge (solving the problem of soft butter getting messy). That's not interesting to Entrepreneur—it might be interesting to a cooking magazine.

But when she shared that she did market research by surveying people at airports instead of paying $10,000 to a research firm? That's an Entrepreneur story—because every entrepreneur who hears it thinks "Aha, I can be that resourceful too."

## How to Apply It

1. **Start with the audience:** Who is the publication trying to reach? What are those readers trying to accomplish?

2. **Study the pattern:** Read 10-20 recent articles. What do they all have in common? What decisions are editors making about:
   - Story structure
   - What gets featured vs. what doesn't
   - The angle they take on similar topics

3. **Reverse engineer the mission:** Ask yourself: "What is the underlying purpose these stories serve? How do they help readers?"

4. **Find your fit:** Once you understand the mission, ask: "What part of my story serves this purpose?" You might have multiple stories—different angles for different outlets.

5. **Customize your pitch:** Frame your story in terms that resonate with the publication's mission, not your marketing message.

## Common Mistakes

- **"I'm an entrepreneur, so I belong in Entrepreneur"** - Being an entrepreneur doesn't make you relevant to their mission
- **"We hired a new president"** - Unless that helps readers think through their own challenges, it's not interesting
- **"We solve a problem"** - Solving problems for customers ≠ solving problems inside a business (which is what Entrepreneur covers)
- **"We're a great success story"** - Success stories aren't interesting; problem-solving stories are
