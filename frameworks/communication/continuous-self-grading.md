# Continuous Self-Grading

> "The simple tip was just grade yourself after you communicate and try to just take a moment and after a while you'll just do it naturally to think about, 'Gosh, how would I have answered that question better?'" - Ian McAllister

## What It Is

Continuous Self-Grading is a practice for improving communication skills through immediate self-reflection. After every significant communication—meeting, email, elevator conversation, Slack exchange—you take a moment to evaluate how you did and identify what you could have done better.

Ian McAllister describes this as a core practice for becoming a better communicator. Unlike waiting for formal feedback from managers or peers, this approach creates a rapid feedback loop where you're constantly identifying areas for improvement and refining your communication in real time.

The practice becomes automatic over time. Eventually, you self-grade without conscious effort, and your communication quality continuously improves.

## How It Works

**The Practice:**
After each significant communication, ask yourself:
1. Did I answer the actual question?
2. Was I concise or did I ramble?
3. Did I use the right level of detail?
4. How could I have made my point more clearly?
5. What would I do differently next time?

**Building the Muscle:**
- Start by consciously doing this after important meetings
- Expand to include emails and documents
- Eventually it becomes automatic, happening without deliberate effort
- The goal is continuous improvement, not perfection

**Feedback Sources:**
- Self-reflection (primary)
- Ask your manager: "What could I have done better in that meeting?"
- Observe how senior leaders communicate and compare
- Watch for nonverbal cues (confusion, impatience) during communication

## How to Apply It

1. **Pick a Trigger**: Start by grading yourself after every meeting with your manager or skip-level.

2. **Keep it Brief**: This shouldn't be a lengthy analysis. 30 seconds of reflection is enough.

3. **Focus on One Thing**: Each time, identify ONE thing you'd do differently. This keeps it actionable.

4. **Write it Down (Optional)**: Keep a brief log for a week. Patterns will emerge.

5. **Extend Gradually**: Once it's habit for meetings, extend to emails, then Slack, then presentations.

## When to Use It

- After meetings with leadership
- After sending important emails or documents
- After presenting to stakeholders
- After answering questions in group settings
- After any communication where you felt uncertain about how it landed

## The Long Game

Ian McAllister emphasizes that improving communication is a career-long journey. He started building this practice early in his Microsoft days, continued through 12 years at Amazon, and is still working on it at Uber. The goal isn't to reach some finish line—it's to get a little better every day.

This approach also models the continuous improvement mindset that's core to great operators at companies like Amazon: never assume you've mastered something, always look for the next improvement.
