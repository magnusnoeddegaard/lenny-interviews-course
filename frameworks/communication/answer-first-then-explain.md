# Answer First Then Explain

> "If you're asked a question and you explain and then maybe you get to the answer, if you just think, answer and then explain or sometimes answer and then shut up, that actually is a tactical thing you can do to get better at communicating." - Ian McAllister

## What It Is

Answer First Then Explain is a fundamental communication pattern that inverts how most people naturally respond to questions. Instead of providing background, context, qualifications, and then finally the answer, this approach flips the order: give the answer immediately, then explain only if necessary.

Ian McAllister learned this lesson early in his career at Microsoft when his product unit manager asked "When is this going to ship?" McAllister responded with background about delays and challenges—but never actually gave a date. The feedback was direct: ultimately, leadership is waiting for a date, not context.

## How It Works

**The Natural (Wrong) Way:**
1. Provide background
2. Explain constraints
3. Add caveats
4. Finally give the answer (maybe)

**The Correct Way:**
1. Give the answer
2. Explain only if needed
3. Sometimes: just answer and shut up

**Examples:**

❌ "Well, we've been running into some issues with the API integration, and the team has been working through some unexpected complexity, and we had to wait for the design review, so..."

✅ "March 15th. We're currently blocked on the API integration but expect to resolve it by end of week."

❌ "There are a lot of factors to consider here, and we've been looking at various options, and it depends on how you define success..."

✅ "Yes, I recommend we do this. Here's why..."

## How to Apply It

1. **Pause Before Responding**: Take a breath and identify what the actual question is asking for.

2. **Identify the Answer Type**: Is it a date, a number, a yes/no, a name? Match your first words to that type.

3. **Answer, Then Stop**: See if you actually need to explain. Sometimes the answer is sufficient.

4. **Grade Yourself**: After conversations, reflect: "Did I answer first, or did I bury the answer?"

5. **Practice with "When" Questions**: These are the easiest to practice with. "When" always wants a date.

## When to Use It

- In meetings with senior leadership (stakes are higher)
- When answering direct questions in any context
- In Slack/email when responding to clear questions
- During presentations in Q&A
- In one-on-ones when your manager asks direct questions
