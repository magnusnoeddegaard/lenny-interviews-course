# Strategic Narrative Framework

> "This structure really is about defining a movement, and that's very different from, 'Hey, I'm going to solve your problem.'" - Andy Raskin

## What It Is

The Strategic Narrative Framework is a five-step structure for positioning your company and product as part of a larger movement rather than just a solution to a problem. Unlike traditional "problem-solution" pitches (what Raskin calls the "arrogant doctor" approach), this framework starts with a fundamental shift happening in the world and positions your company as helping people win in this new reality.

The insight came from screenwriting: every great movie starts with some kind of shift in the character's world. Applied to business, this means opening not with "you have a problem, we have a solution," but with "the world has changed, and here's how winners are adapting."

The archetypal example is Salesforce. Instead of pitching "we're a better CRM than Siebel," Benioff declared: "Software is over. There's this new world called the cloud. That's the new way to win. And we're going to help you get there." This reframes all competitors as part of the "old game" rather than engaging in feature comparisons.

## How It Works

The framework has five sequential components:

### 1. Name the Shift (Old Game → New Game)

Identify a fundamental change happening in the world and give it a concise, memorable name. This isn't just "the world is changing" with bullet points—it's a crisp, named transition.

Examples:
- **Salesforce**: Software → Cloud
- **Zuora**: Transactions → Subscriptions
- **Gong**: Opinions → Reality
- **Drift**: Forms (Later) → Conversation (Now)
- **360Learning**: Top-Down Training → Upskill From Within

The naming must be compact. You're overstating it deliberately—not everything is a subscription, but the compression is what makes it memorable and repeatable.

### 2. Name the Stakes

Show why this shift matters using life-and-death framing. The movie parallel: in Star Wars, Luke is reluctant to join the mission until the Empire kills his aunt and uncle. Now the stakes are survival, not convenience.

Methods to establish stakes:
- **Show winners already playing the new game** ("Look, Airbnb, Box, Netflix—they're all doing subscriptions")
- **Show the consequence of staying in the old game** ("Fortune 500 company lifespan is shrinking")
- **Make the future feel binary**: great outcome vs. terrible outcome, not "sort of okay"

The prospect must feel that continuing with the old game leads to irrelevance or death.

### 3. Name the Object of the New Game

Create a rallying cry—a concise statement of what winning looks like in the new world. Often framed as a question.

Examples:
- **Zuora**: "Turn every customer into a subscriber"
- **Airbnb**: "Belong anywhere" / "Live there"
- **Gong**: "See what's really happening in your pipeline"

This becomes the company's mission and the bar for everything. It should be asymptotically unachievable—you never fully "live there," but you keep getting closer.

### 4. Name the Obstacles

Identify 3-5 challenges that prevent people from winning this new game. These sound like problems, but the story context has repackaged them as obstacles to a life-and-death goal.

For Zuora (turning customers into subscribers):
- How do you measure lifetime value instead of transaction value?
- How do you track changing preferences over time?
- How do you handle the always-on relationship?

These are the "monsters" blocking the hero's path—the Empire, the obstacles in Lord of the Rings. They explain why winning is hard and why the company needs to exist.

### 5. Introduce Your Magic Gifts

Only now do you introduce your product—as the tools that help overcome those obstacles. In narrative terms, these are the "magic gifts" the hero receives (Luke's lightsaber, Frodo's ring).

This is where features and capabilities live, but they're positioned as weapons against named obstacles, not just "things we built."

## How to Apply It

1. **Draft your Old Game → New Game shift** - What fundamental change are you helping people navigate? Name it in 2-4 words per side.

2. **Gather evidence for stakes** - Who are the winners already in the new game? What happens to those who stay in the old game? Make it life-and-death.

3. **Craft your object question** - "What would it take to [achieve the new game goal]?" This becomes your rallying cry.

4. **List 3-5 obstacles** - What prevents companies from winning this new game? These become your problem framing.

5. **Map your capabilities to obstacles** - Your product features are the magic gifts that overcome each obstacle.

6. **Test in live conversations** - When you present the shift, do prospects say "Yes, I'm seeing that" or lean back skeptically? Iterate based on response.

7. **Make it the north star** - Use this narrative to filter product decisions: "Does this help people [achieve object of new game]? It's in. Does it not? Deprioritized."

## When to Use It

**Best fit:**
- B2B enterprise sales with complex buying committees
- Products that are part of a larger market shift
- Series B+ companies scaling beyond founder-led sales
- Acquisitions or expansions that need a broader positioning story
- Products that are easily commoditized on features alone

**Timing signals that you need this:**
- Sales success relies on "brute force of founders" being in every meeting
- You're always asked "How are you different from [competitor]?"
- Marketing produces content about features, not the broader movement
- Product team lacks a clear bar for feature prioritization
- The company has expanded and the old story doesn't fit anymore

**Not ideal for:**
- Consumer products with simple purchase decisions
- Very early stage (pre-product-market fit)
- Products where feature comparison is the whole decision
