# Founder-Led Marketing

> "I think today there's so many AI startups that are much more either B2C or prosumer. And so you're not necessarily talking to individual prospects, but the idea that you can be really in control of the narrative on the marketing side is really, really important." - Grant Lee

## What It Is

Founder-Led Marketing is the analog to founder-led sales for B2C and prosumer products. Just as founders should understand sales before hiring salespeople, they should master marketing fundamentals before delegating to marketers or agencies.

This means founders personally crafting narratives, writing copy, posting on social media, and working directly with influencers. The goal isn't to do marketing forever, but to build the skills and understanding needed to hire well and maintain high standards.

Grant Lee describes how this skill set compounds: when you've personally learned what makes a good hook, how to structure content, and how hard good copywriting is, you can actually evaluate and guide others effectively.

## How It Works

**1. Value Exchange Model**
Unlike founder-led sales where value is exchanged for money, founder-led marketing exchanges value for goodwill. Share tactics, insights, and learnings generously. Over time, that goodwill converts to brand awareness and product adoption.

**2. Skill Development Cycle**
- Start posting, even if it feels cringe
- Track what resonates (bookmarks, shares, retweets)
- Analyze your "all-star posts" for patterns
- Improve your copywriting and storytelling
- Apply learnings to work with others

**3. Platform Fluency**
Different platforms want different things. Grant invests more heavily in LinkedIn (more aspirational, broader statements) while tailoring Twitter content (more tactical, contrarian, technical).

## How to Apply It

### Getting Started
1. **Keep a running doc** - Jot down things you learned, observed, or found unintuitive as you build
2. **Block dedicated time** - Grant uses early mornings (inspiration) and late nights (reflection)
3. **Start small** - Don't let intimidation prevent action. Begin with simple observations.
4. **Stress test internally** - Run ideas by teammates: "Is this interesting? Have you heard this before?"

### Content That Works
- **Things that are unintuitive but worked** - Contrarian wisdom earns attention
- **Tactical specifics** - Real numbers, real tactics, not generic advice
- **What you actually learned** - Fresh observations beat recycled insights

### Platform Strategy
- **LinkedIn**: Aspirational, thematic, relevant topics of the moment
- **Twitter/X**: Tactical, contrarian, technical, in-the-weeds specifics

### Working With Others
Once you've developed the skill:
- Work with influencers who feel like extensions of your team
- Open-source your brand assets (Gamma has brand.gamma.app)
- Set high bars because you understand how hard good marketing is

## The Mindset Shift

**From**: "I'll hire someone to do marketing"
**To**: "I need to understand marketing deeply enough to hire well and collaborate effectively"

**From**: "This feels like self-promotion"
**To**: "I'm sharing value, and in exchange I get goodwill that converts to brand awareness"

## When to Use It

- **Early stage** - Before you can afford a marketing team
- **B2C/prosumer products** - Where you can't do 1:1 founder-led sales
- **Building influencer programs** - You need marketing intuition to guide creators
- **Hiring marketers** - So you can evaluate quality and set the bar

## Warning Signs You're Doing It Wrong

- Content feels like an ad rather than value
- You're giving scripts to influencers instead of context
- Writing lacks clarity (trying to be clever instead of clear)
- You can't identify what makes good marketing vs. bad
