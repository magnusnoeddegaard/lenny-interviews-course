# Topic Selection Framework

> "Your likelihood to follow through on something you start writing is a function of the objective you have with writing that piece and how strong your motivation is for seeing that objective to fruition." - Julian Shapiro

## What It Is

The Topic Selection Framework helps writers choose what to write about by pairing a clear **objective** (what the piece should accomplish) with a strong **motivation** (why you personally care about completing it).

Many writers struggle to finish pieces because they start without knowing when they're done or why they care. This framework solves both problems - the objective tells you when to stop, and the motivation keeps you going until you get there.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Choose an Objective

Your objective defines what the piece should accomplish for readers. It's your guidepost for knowing when you're done. Examples:

| Objective | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **Open people's eyes** | Prove the status quo wrong |
| **Articulate the unsaid** | Say what everyone's thinking but no one is saying |
| **Contribute original insights** | Share discoveries from your own research/experimentation |
| **Tell a suspenseful story** | Impart a lesson through narrative |
| **Create a reference guide** | Build something readers will return to repeatedly |
| **Cut through noise** | Simplify a complex topic |

Without an objective, you don't know when you're done. You just peter out and write an outro when it "feels right."

### Step 2: Pair with a Motivation

Your motivation is why YOU care about completing this piece. It's what sustains you through the hard parts. Examples:

| Motivation | The Drive |
|------------|-----------|
| **Get something off your chest** | You need to express something that's been building up |
| **Solve a nagging problem** | Writing is how you'll explore and find the solution |
| **Obsess over a topic** | You want others to geek out about this with you |
| **Document for future self** | You're creating a reference you'll use later |
| **Teach what you've learned** | You want to help others avoid your mistakes |
| **Build your reputation** | You want to be known for this expertise |

Strong motivation sustains you through the work. Weak motivation leads to abandoned drafts.

### The Combination

The magic is in the pairing:

- **Objective**: Open people's eyes by proving status quo wrong
- **Motivation**: I've been frustrated by this misconception for years and need to get it off my chest

Now you have both a clear endpoint AND the fuel to get there.

## How to Apply It

1. **Before writing, explicitly state your objective**
   - "This piece will articulate what everyone in tech is thinking about AI but no one is saying"
   - "This piece will serve as a reference guide I can return to"

2. **Test your motivation**
   - Can you articulate why YOU care about this topic?
   - Is it strong enough to sustain hours of work?
   - If motivation is weak, choose a different topic

3. **Use objective as your editing guide**
   - After drafting, ask: "Have I accomplished the objective?"
   - Cut anything that doesn't serve the objective
   - You're done when the objective is achieved

4. **Match intensity of objective to motivation**
   - Big objectives require strong motivations
   - Don't attempt "change the industry's thinking" if your motivation is weak

## When to Use It

- **Starting a new piece**: Before writing, define both objective and motivation
- **Stuck in the middle**: Reconnect with your motivation to push through
- **Evaluating ideas**: Filter topics by whether you have both elements
- **Finishing**: Check if you've achieved the objective before publishing
