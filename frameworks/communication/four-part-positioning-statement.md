# Four-Part Positioning Statement

> "I had a student in my last class... at the end of the class he goes, 'I'll never write a line of code without doing positioning first.' That was music to my ears." - Arielle Jackson

## What It Is

The Four-Part Positioning Statement is a 40-50 year old marketing framework that distills your product positioning into a single structured sentence. While it can feel like "mad libs" if approached cold, it becomes powerful when you've done the underlying work of understanding your audience, their problems, and your differentiation.

This statement becomes the foundation for everything from your homepage H1 to your sales pitch to how customers describe you to their friends.

## How It Works

### The Template

**For** [target audience] **who** [statement of need or opportunity], **our** [product name] **is a** [category] **that** [key benefit]. **Unlike** [primary alternative], **our product** [key differentiator].

### The Components

1. **Target Audience**: The specific group you're going after (from your Concentric Circles)

2. **Statement of Need/Opportunity**: The problem they have or opportunity they're missing

3. **Product Name**: What you call your solution

4. **Category**: What type of thing it is (helps people place you mentally)

5. **Key Benefit**: What users would tell other users about why they use it

6. **Primary Alternative**: What they do today (not always a direct competitor—could be the status quo)

7. **Key Differentiator**: Why your solution is better than the alternative

### Example: Square Stand

**For** brick and mortar quick-serve businesses (coffee shops, donut shops, sandwich shops) **who** are using ugly old cash registers, **our** Square Stand **is a** point-of-sale system **that** turns your iPad into a point of sale. **Unlike** traditional cash registers, **Square Stand** gives you one unified experience that does everything your cash register does and more, and you'd be proud to have it on your counter.

## How to Apply It

### Step 1: Answer the Underlying Questions
Before filling in the template, answer:
- Who is this for? (target audience)
- What is their problem?
- How do they address that problem today?
- What do you make?
- How does it work?
- What would you want a user to tell another user?

### Step 2: Fill in the Template
Use your answers to complete each part of the statement.

### Step 3: Test with the Bar Test
Imagine two people from your target audience at a bar:

> "Hey, I just started using [product name]. It's this really great [category] that [benefit]."
>
> "Hmm, tell me more."
>
> "Yeah, unlike [alternative], it [differentiator]."

If it sounds like something people would actually say, you're on the right track.

### Step 4: Refine the Language
- Remove jargon ("leverages," "empowers")
- Use words people actually speak
- Keep it to one sentence each part

## When to Use It

- Before naming your company (positioning dictates naming)
- Before writing any marketing copy
- Before building a website
- When pitching to press (they need to describe you in one sentence)
- When onboarding new employees
- When different stakeholders describe the company differently

## Signs Your Positioning Is Off

> "You have a positioning problem if I ask 10 of your customers or 10 of your employees what the company does or what the product does. And I get multiple answers."

- Takes 30 minutes to explain what you do
- Can't describe it in one sentence
- 10 people give 10 different descriptions
- Homepage copy is vague or buzzword-filled
- Customers say "I don't really know how to explain what they do"

## The Key Benefit Test

> "Great benefits if you've defined your benefit really, really well will actually be the thing that will be the H1 on your homepage and will be the thing that you want someone to tell someone else."

For Square Stand: "Turn your iPad into a point of sale"
- H1 on homepage? ✓
- What customers say to friends? ✓
- Memorable and repeatable? ✓
