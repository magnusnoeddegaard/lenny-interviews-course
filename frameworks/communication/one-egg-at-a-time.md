# One Egg at a Time

> "There's this thing from consumer advertising, which is you throw a consumer one egg, they can probably catch it. You throw them four or five eggs, they're probably going to drop all of them." - Grant Lee

## What It Is

The One Egg at a Time framework is a principle borrowed from consumer advertising that applies to product positioning, onboarding, marketing, and presentations. The core insight: when you try to communicate too many ideas simultaneously, your audience retains none of them.

Founders often want to showcase all their product's capabilities—five features, ten differentiators. But this creates confusion. By focusing on one compelling "egg" at a time, you give your audience something they can actually catch and remember.

For Gamma, the one egg was simple: "create a slide in seconds." That's the entire pitch. Some people will opt out, but those who catch that egg have a clear value proposition to hold onto.

## How It Works

The framework reflects fundamental constraints on human attention and memory:

**1. Attention is limited**
Users can only focus on one thing at a time. Multiple messages compete with and cancel each other out.

**2. Memory is selective**
People remember the first or strongest thing they encounter. Subsequent messages get lost.

**3. Decision-making gets paralyzed**
Too many options or value props create choice paralysis rather than action.

**4. Word-of-mouth requires simplicity**
Users can only pass along what they can articulate in a sentence. Complex pitches don't spread.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your strongest egg** - What is the single most compelling thing about your product? If you had to pick one feature, one benefit, one differentiator—what would it be?

2. **Lead with it everywhere** - Your landing page, onboarding, pitch deck, and marketing should all open with the same core message.

3. **Sequence, don't stack** - You can share multiple eggs, but only one at a time. First this, then that. Never simultaneously.

4. **Test with word-of-mouth** - Ask early users to describe your product. If they can't do it in one sentence, your egg isn't clear enough.

5. **Apply to presentations** - When presenting, give one idea per slide. One concept at a time. Let each egg be caught before throwing the next.

## Examples

**Too Many Eggs (Bad)**
"Our product helps you create presentations faster with AI, it has 20 templates, works with your team, exports to PowerPoint, has version history, and integrates with Slack."

**One Egg (Good)**
"Create a slide in seconds."

**Applied to Different Contexts:**
- **Pitch deck**: One key point per slide
- **Landing page**: One hero message above the fold
- **Onboarding**: One task to complete initially
- **Sales call**: One problem to solve

## When to Use It

- **Designing onboarding flows** - Strip down to one action, one value proposition
- **Creating marketing copy** - Lead with one benefit, not a feature list
- **Giving presentations** - Structure around one idea at a time
- **Pitching investors or customers** - Open with your single strongest point
- **Simplifying product positioning** - When struggling to explain what you do

## The Anti-Pattern

When you find yourself saying "AND" a lot in your pitch:
- "We do X AND Y AND Z"
- "It helps with A AND B AND C"

You're throwing too many eggs. Pick the best one.
