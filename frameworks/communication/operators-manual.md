# Operator's Manual

> "You've got to be a clear thinker to be a clear communicator. And so there's two tests in writing well or communicating well. It's both those things." - Ian McAllister

## What It Is

The Operator's Manual is a compiled set of communication and operational best practices that Ian McAllister developed during his time at Amazon. It originated from the "Book of Kim"—a collection of lessons gathered from Kim Rackmiller, Amazon's first TPM and a demanding but brilliant leader who enforced high standards of communication.

The manual codifies the specific behaviors that separate effective operators from ineffective ones. It's not about generic advice but specific, actionable practices that can be immediately applied to improve communication quality.

## How It Works

**Core Communication Principles:**

1. **Answer First, Then Explain** - When asked a question, give the answer immediately. Don't provide background, context, or caveats first. Answer, then explain if needed.

2. **Avoid Weasel Words** - Remove hedging language that undermines clarity. Say what you mean directly.

3. **Own Your Problems** - Don't deflect or minimize issues. Take responsibility and focus on solutions.

4. **Answer "When" Questions with Dates** - If someone asks when something will ship, they want a date—not context about why it's taking longer.

5. **Know How to Use Numbers** - Quantify wherever possible. Numbers answer questions more effectively than qualitative statements.

**The Self-Grading Practice:**

After every communication—meeting, email, elevator conversation—take a moment to evaluate:
- Did I answer the actual question?
- Could I have been more concise?
- What would have made my response clearer?

Over time, this becomes automatic and dramatically improves communication quality.

## How to Apply It

1. **Start Small**: Pick one principle (like "answer first") and focus on it for a week. Notice when you violate it.

2. **Grade Yourself**: After each significant communication, ask "how could I have done that better?" This builds the continuous improvement muscle.

3. **Practice with "When" Questions**: Every time you're asked "when," force yourself to give a date first. You can add context after.

4. **Seek Feedback**: Ask your manager or peers: "What could I have done better in that meeting/email/presentation?"

5. **Watch for Weasel Words**: Remove phrases like "I think," "maybe," "sort of," "we're hoping to" when they add no value.

## When to Use It

- Every day in your communications
- Especially important when communicating with senior leadership where stakes are higher
- When preparing for important meetings or presentations
- When writing documents that will be reviewed by leadership
- When training new PMs or team members

## The Book of Kim: Original Practices

From Amazon's Kim Rackmiller that started the collection:
- Avoid weasel words
- Answer first, then explain
- Own your problems
- Know your numbers cold

Ian McAllister extended this over time with additional practices observed and developed throughout his career.
